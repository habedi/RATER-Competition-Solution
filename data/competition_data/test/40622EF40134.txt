In our current day and age we are making monumental discoveries and breakthroughs in technology and medicine. Mankind has risen above any previous prowess it has ever seen. In addition to the dumbfounding advances in technology already made, we have many more waiting just aruond the corner. Among these new discoveries is the autonomous car. However their seem to be many problems that could arrise with these driverless cars such as potential malfunctions in technology, legal liability difficulties in case of a crash, and the fact that they might turn on us.

While the idea of driverless cars may seem far off it is actually much closer than most would pressume, with Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan all planning to relearse autonomous cars by 2020 as seen in paragraph ten of the source document. However, one of the obsticles of the driverless car is the potential for the technology to malfunction. "Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over", if the technology formerly mentioned were to malfunction the potential injury and death would be imminent.

With the incident of a crash involving an autonomous car invlolved many legal issues would arise. Foremost among these potential legal disputes would be that of liabilty. While paragraph nine reveals that the majority of states do not allow autonomous cars, "Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.", the problem of liability, weather it be the driver or the manufacturer at fualt, still arises.

At the very forefront of all of the issues and potential problems with the idea of the autonomous car is the imminent, unavoidable threat that they would undoubtedly turn on us. As seen in Terminator 3 Judgement Day, the technology would gain a mind of its own and begin to destroy all of the humans. The cars would begin to crash themselves and run down helpless pedestrians with cute little puppies and ice cream. Most likely the cars would soon adapt after the military got involved and begin to mount machine guns, artillery and any other gun the could think of or pruduce. they would being to be made with faces and would look like a cross between Arnold and Lightning McQueen. dropping out of autonomous helicopters to destroy us all with their evilishy cute murderous faces.

While there are many other reasons and evidences for not prudicing the machine which will kill us the three most important have been touched upon today. Therefore because of the potential malfuntcion in technology, legal obscurities and impening armageddon and war between man and machine the autonomous car should not be produced or pursued any further. In conclusion, aim for the head, do not get bitten and beware the machines.
