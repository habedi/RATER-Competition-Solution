The Face was discovered forty years ago by scientists at NASA who saw the FAce for the first time and said it was a martian mesa. Later when the photo was released to the public conspiracy theorists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but the picture was taken on an older camera on the Viking I that the photo was fuzzy and no one could be sure of what was on the Face. Twenty-two years later another photo was taken with a camera ten times sharper than the original viking I photo. Still some people believed it was an alien artifact and the clouds on mars covered some alien markings that may have been covered by haze. Some theorists believed that NASA was trying to hide evidence of alien life on Mars. Others questioned theorists about why NASA would want to hide something like that and how it would benefit scientists at NASA. Three years later another team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. When conspiracy theorists saw the picture had no markings of alien origin and saw it was just a bute or mesa like landforms found in the American West.
