Most students have some sort of difficulties when it comes to school, whether its learning, family problems, social life, or even health issues. Therefore, students may not make it to school or might not be motivated to go because they feel behind. A vital solution to this problem could be online classes and video conferencing to help the students who were not at school or any students who needs extra attention. Online classes and video conferencing could benefit many students by giving those young scholars the help and lessons they might have missed in class. I think schools should implement online classes and video conferencing because they may not fully comprehended the information, they may have an terrible learning environment, or they may just miss days for personal reasons.

Majority of students dont get things the first time round and thats understandable, but some students still dont get it after the second or third time. Those are the students that are most likely scared to ask questions or dont have the time to stay back with their teacher for extra help. This is where online classes could really help those who struggle in school. With online classes, students have a one on one sessions with their teachers ensuring any confusion they have with the lessons in class. For example, what if a student is in class and he or she doesn't get the content thats being taught, but he or she is afraid to ask questions or is too frustrated to ask anything. This is why the online classes is a great option for students like that. Some may argue that she could just stay after school or they may not even go online to get help, but I see it like this, if someone is truly struggling and desperately wants help then they will get all the help they need.

Being in a comfortable environment is a key to success. Even in school, without a suitable and comfortable environment, learning and focusing is going to be ten times harder. Students cannot learn in class when the teacher is constantly telling the kids to be quiet or sit down every five minutes. Even in a class with your friends could be a bad learning environment because they are constantly distracting you, but with a online class at home, you are in a very comfortable environment being that your in the comfort of your own home. This is great for kids that want to extend their studies to the college level but have a hard time getting the information because of their class room environment. Many colleges and jobs are education based, so in order to get into the best of the best of colleges or jobs, students have to have the best grades they could possibly get, but with class room disrupts students cant learn and show their learning to their best abilities.

Students are humans too and us as humans have problems too. Meaning that us students are going to miss days of school for many different reasons, whether it be family issues, health issues or even car issues, we as students are going to miss a day or two. With that day being missed, students are bound to miss a lesson and be behind on work which would eventually result in a zero in the grade book. With the access of online classes we could be brought up to date with the current lessons and understand whats going on in class. For example, if a student misses three days because of the flu, they are definitely going to be behind on work and behind in the class curriculum, but say if the student did have an online resource to help him catch up from home, that student wouldnt miss anything and be up to speed with the class even from home. By the time that student returns to school they would know everything that happened even in the days they were out.

In conclusion, students are humans too and we are not perfect machines that can learn everything on the spot or be at school everyday, so with schools offering an alternative to help students learn away from school is a genius idea that can benefit many students in the future.
