The use of technology to determine the emotional expression of students in a classroom is not valuable. I personally do not think that a computer can analyze a human face and determine in percentages what their emotions are. A human can not be 2% angry and 75% happy. A computer can only determine what looks like on the outside, but not in the inside.

We humans can guess by looking at someone if they are upset, furious, meloncholoy, or estatic. Humans can determine that by their body character or their facial expressions. We cry when we are angry, sad, or happy. A computer could not know that. We ask how they're feeling and most of the time humans can lie about their emotions. They tend to hide them within a smile or a laugh. People may look angry, but that's their natural face expressions. In a room full of students, you are going to get many different emotions depending on what time it is during the day. If it's the morning, students will most likely be tired or sleepy. If it's around noon they may be hungry. During the afternoon students will most likely to be ready to leave school. The time of day can have a mega impact on a person's mood.

A computer may have an estimated guess on a person's mood, but it will never determine it. Us humans are special. We have many different ways we express emotion. We may feel many emotions at the same time, but a computer system could not determine that. We change how we feel all the time. We may not express it either. The FACS system may mistake our emotions through one picture. They could see a picture of you crying and decided that your sad, but in reality you're crying of laughter. In my opinion, you can not decide the expression of Mona Lisa just by looking at one painting. If they had a document saying she was happy most of the time her portrait was painted, then would believe it. Since they don't, I don't believe in anything FACS has documented.

The use of technology can not determine ones emotion(s). Only we can decide on what we feel or how others feel. I strongly believe that we are the only ones who can see emotion.
