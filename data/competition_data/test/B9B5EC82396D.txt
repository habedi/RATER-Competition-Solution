Technology to read the emotional expressions of students could be valuable. Using technology to read students' faces could greatly effect how and what they learn, for instance if a student is stuck on a problem the computer would recognize that and tone it down. But that may not be benificial to all of the students, some students may be better at learning hands-on, visually, or by sound, a teacher cam provide all of that. What a teacher can't do is fulfill the needs of multiple individuals without wasting a lot of time. This new technology could immediately know that the student is frustrated or having a hard time. In class the student may not understandwhat's being taught and won't speak up, but with face recognizition there's no hiding your emotions.

Aside from learning, the Facial Action Coding System could help with mental problems, for example, if a student had a significant amount of sadness or anger , the teachers would know that something's bothering them.

Facial recognizition coudl potientially help with more problems than I could think of.
