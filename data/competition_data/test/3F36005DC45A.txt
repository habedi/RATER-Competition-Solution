Dear principal,

I think we should keep the average to play sports at a c average because a c is still a passing grade and if they have a passing grade they should be eligible to play any sport or be involved in any activities they want to be in. A lot of kids have a c average and sports may be a big part of their life taking that away from them could hurt their grade even more because playing a sport is something they look forward to. i think kids need to be involved in activities. So please do not try to change the grade to play sports to a c. I know that if a kid wants to play a sport it will make him and or her bring up their grade but it may also hurt them too. If a senior is playing basketball and they have a c average and they have a scholar ship to a good collage for basketball and you change the grave average to a b they would probably get the scholarship taken away and if I were them I would cry. Sports can change some poor persons life that didn't have a good house to live in and didn't have the best grades. Making a change in the school policy when kids have already adjusted to them would be horrible. Just like if we changed the law for driving to seven-teen and you were six-teen you would be very mad because driving may be something you love to do and you wouldn't want that taken away so why do that to us?

Thanks so please do not change it or else you may not have a good football basketball cheerleader or any other team.
