In the article it states that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify thr lesson". If the computer modifies the lesson and makes the student more ingaged the student wouldn't become bored or uninterested and they will pay more attention. If the technoloy modifies the lesson where the student couldn't become confused and make it more understandable the student wouldn't get upset or want to give up on the lesson. A human instructor can't change the whole lesson because one student is confused or bored but if the technology was placed in schools it'll benefit the students one on one help where it can change the lesson to the students liking or unstanding. The techology will change the way students learn and benfit them in their edcational career.
