Hello my name is Luke Bomberger and, welcome to the Seagoing Cowboys program, you can't stand animals getting hurt or even worse so join the program to save the little critters. Now don't just sit there lying on the sofa, come help us save animals and the plants, so they both don't get hurt.

Being a seagoing cowboy is much more than an adveture, it opens up everyones world world. Here at the program, we have all sorts of fun, volleyball,baseball, and even table tennis tournaments and more.

You can be 18 because when me and my friend were here I just turned 18 and I was here that is how I got my start, we got here August 14 the Pacific war had just ended. We headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

In 1945 i have made nine trips the most of any seagoing cowboy, it was not brevity to cross everywhere to where i needed to go, I also toured Canal on his way to China. It took two weeks to croaa the Alantic ocean form the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to get to China.

We need more people to help us with this program, so why don't you just join us already come on it will be fun.
