Many people believe in the Electoral college, but I think it's time for a change. The electoral college isn't completely fair to the people. It isn't fair because the elected person that will vote for you could always change the vote so he may vote for whom they like. Instead of electing somone to vote for you and your state, you should be able to vote individually.

The popular vote is more fair than the Electoral vote because each person's vote will go toward the canidate of their choice knowing that their vote will count as much as everyone elses. This will most likely result in more people voting and a smaller chance of a tie. Just because someone is representing their voters, doesn't mean that everyone will be happy with the electoral voter's decision. People who are for the Electoral college claim that it invariably produces a clear winner. This is partially true but is not completely true. It might produce a clear winner, but it is not a fair vote. If America is about rights, fairness, and freedom then why do we let other people vote for us?

The electoral overthrows the popular vote, so why should we let 500 people decide who beomes President for millions of people? We shouldn't. The Electoral college is out of date and if anything it needs to be updated so it is more just and fair for everyone. Even in source three it clearly states that the people do not vote for the President- the electors do. So when you vote, you're not even voting for a President. You're voting for an elector. Those for the Electoral college also say that the turst between an elector and state is rarely broken, but why take a chance on someone betraying you when you can just vote for yourself?
