Dear Principal,

I believe that community service should be required at our school. For the following reasons. It will help students understand that you must do something too help others, it can help students stay out of trouble, and we can learn a couple of new things.

First of all, I believe that students should be required to have an amount of hours they must complete because they need too understand that in life you will always have to help others and not just yourself. This way it can help us prepare for our jobs as we get older. By us doing community service we will be helping others and know that this is something we should do all the time, and not just for community service.

Next, i believe that we should have community service so it can waste some time that we could be using to get in trouble. If we are required to do community service then we will be giving up time to the community. While we are doing our community service we could have been roaming the streets and not doing good things. We could be almost getting into a fight but if we have to do community service then there is no way we would be able too.

Finally, I believe we should be required to do community service because we can learn a few things while we are doing it. Say we are doing our community service hours tutoring we could be tutoring someone that may know something we don't. We could be picking up trash and the person we are helping could be telling you something that you didn't know before.

In conclusion, I believe we should be required to do community service hours for the reasons I listed above. You may be against community service but u should really think about the reasons I listed.

Sincerely,
