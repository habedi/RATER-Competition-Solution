I think that we should be able to have are phones to school.

The three reasons why I think why we should have are phones school because what if we have an emergency. The second reason is what if we had a problem with some other students. My last reason what if a predator comes in and nobody has their cell phone, what would we do then. I am about to tell you some more about my reasons.

The first reason why I think that we should have phones at school is what if we have an emergency. If we have an emergency where there are no teachers around than what would we do if we didn't have are phones. Plus what if there was a some illegal stuff going on what would we do with out our cell phones. That was my first reason why I think that we should have are sell phones at school.

My second reason is what if we had some problems with other students. What if you got beat up really bad, what would you do if you didn't have your phone. Plus what if you got bullied and you didn't want anybody to know what would you do if you didn't have your cell phone. TH was my second reason why i think we should have are cell phones at school.

My last reason why I think we should have are phones at school is because what if a predator comes in or something. What if somebody came in shooting or something what would we do with out are cell phone. Plus what if somebody was trying to hurt some body what would we do with out are phones. That was my last reason why I think that we should have cell phones at school.

Those are all my reasons why I think we should have cell phones at school. I hope that you will under stand my reasons.

sincerely,
