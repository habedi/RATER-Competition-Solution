I'm Kaitlyn a scientist at NASA. Since the year of 1976 there has been many people trying to figure out what the 'Face on Mars' is, but more importantly how did the face get there? Did anliens do it? Was it just a blur in the picture? Through the years people have been trying to figure out this mistory.

I can asure you that it was not aliens. Since the year of 1976 we were able to get better and clearer photos. On March 5, 1998 one of our Mars Surveyor flew over the "face" for the first time. Michael Marlin took a picture ten times better than the original image. We thought that would for sure clear up all the alien talk. The image showed a natural landform, but that didn't satisfy everone.

The picture was taken during a cloudy time on Mars. Since the camera had to look through clouds skeptics said "alien marking were hidden by haze."

Once again Media was talking about how there is still a posibility that the landform was created by something not of our world. We were stuburn to prove them wrong.

It is not easy, but we tried again. On April 8, 2001 we had another chance. Soon Marlins team captured an extraordinary photo. Now they used a camera even more high tech than before. You could see the details in the photo. This time the photo was taken on a clear day. We studied the photo here at NASA, and you can clearly see the photo is of a landform much like a butte or mesa, which are often found in the American West. Thanks to the upgraded technology you can clearly see it's just an ordinary land form.
