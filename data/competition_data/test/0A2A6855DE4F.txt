Sports have been a big part of school for as long as we all know of. Do you believe it's a good policy to remove those with failing grades off of their sport's team? Having to change a policy a such as removing students with below a B grade average is a important thing to do especially if your player is not doing so great education wise. It can help them pick up their grades. It is also a good consequence to show that without good grades, you are not allowed to play.

The policy of removing those with low grade average off their sports team is a good idea, because it helps your student stay on track and pick up their grades. Being excused from a sport event due to grades, can show the student that he or she needs to spend less time practicing with the team and more time getting better grades. I, being a sports player, know that without grades, I cannot play a game or attend practice. This gives you time to make up missing assignments, get extra credit, get a better grade, and continue doing that sport you like to do.

This policy is also good because you need to give consequences to those who do not do well in school. Yes, getting in trouble with coach is bad, but school is important. Without a great education, the chances of becoming a professional athlete become very slim. You need grades, and good practice to make you a great player and a great student.

Having good grades, reminds me that I can create a better future, and not worry about being excused from my team.

Many of you may agree with my opinion about this policy, but I know some of you may have some concerns. Maybe one of these concerns is that your student won't proceed with getting good grades. Well the solution to that is simple, no grades, no play. I understand, as a athlete myself, having to be excused due to grades is bad and can get me a little upset. But I know, without my grades, I won't be allowed back on the team.

So as you can see having a policy such as this one is good for the school, and your students. It helps them get back on track. It is also good consequence for those that don't get good grades. Just remember, being strict isn't all that bad because
