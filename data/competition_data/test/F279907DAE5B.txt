Dear principal,

I personally think that you should give every kid community service. Giving kids community service really helps kids get out of trouble ,help our community and teach kids that helping the community can really help set a good example for the next generation to come.

First, I feel that you should give kids community service to make sure they stay out of trouble. Kids that go hang with friends usually are up to no good. Community service can give them a reason to stay out of trouble. It can really change a kid and teach them about the importance of keeping to community nice and safe

Also, community service can help teach kids to be more respectful to our communities. this can also set a good example for younger kids so that by lending a hand they can really change the environment to a healthy community.

In conclusion, i feel that giving kids community service can really help not only us but everyone else in this community, and change our environment to a healthy one.
