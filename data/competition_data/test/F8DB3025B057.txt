I am against of using the new technology software to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because I think it doesn't really matter to know how the students' emotions are unless they are getting work done and participating then its fine but other than that I disagree on having this technology to be used on students to know there emotions. If a student is feeling down you would really notice by their participation in the classroom and their facial expression if the student is into anything but if not why is it so important to just look real quick on the software of how the students emotional expression is? This new software thing is really cool and interesting in some way because its great how someone is able to create technology software to see how someone really feels when they are taking a picture if their " happy, sad,angry,exhausted" that's very interesting to find out,but i only think its not really a big of a deal to even to study it on students. So I strongly disagree to this option. I also would like to add I think it would be interesting for students to use as an essay in class for like a history class to do a project like this for any assignment because its very interesting to see examples as Mona Lisa really felt the day they took these photographs that made the picture so famous:how did they really feel. It would be a very enjoyable assignment for students to do.
