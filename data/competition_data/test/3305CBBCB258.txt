Dear, Principal

The policy that i think is best is the first policy. I think the first policy is the best because the students get to have there phones out during lunch and other free times. If we had our phones out at lunch we could text our parents asking them if we can stay for a baseball game or a basketball game so they don't have to come and get us after school. Then if you did the first policy you would know that we had our phones off during school so no one would be texting during school. Another reason policy one is better is because we could call or text a family member or friend and tell them about an important meeting. Then if one of your family members are sick you could call or text them and see how they are doing. You could listen to music at lunch on your phone. If you was in a hurry for your next class you could take a picture of your homework assignment. If you was out sick that day you could text a friend at lunch time and ask him what the homework assignments was or you could text a friend and tell them what the homework was for that day.

Then at lunch you could play games on your phone after you got done eating. You could take pictures with you friends .So the best policy that i think is the best is policy one. I hope you choose policy one because a lot of students would like it. If you choose policy one we will promise to have our phones off during the school day, and we will not text during the day.
