Dear principal,

I believe taking away sports or other activities for students with less than a B average will not be helpful to them because school activities help students, sports are healthy, and studying all day can be stressful.

I think school activities are helpful to students.

Some teach kids to be responsible and others teach them to be creative.

If you are working on the school yearbook you can become very creative and it will benefit them in the future.

Jobs require some creativity such as being an artist or musician.

Taking this away will not help them.

Secondly sports are healthy and get students active.

It is a healthy alternative to watching television or playing video games.

It is also a fun way to pass the time with friends.

Some people may think sports will distract students minds and keep there grades low. When you do some activities such as sports you become less lazy.

Some students don't do homework because they are lazy. This will help them.

Studying or working all day with no fun can be stressful.

Students need some type of fun and these school activities are the healthiest.

If you take these away it will lead to stressful students and students doing unhealthy activities to pass the time such as watching television or even doing drugs.

Some people may be thinking studying is very good.

Studying is very good but too much is not good.

This all means that taking away activities for students C averages is bad. It will help all studew
