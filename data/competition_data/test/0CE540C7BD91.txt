If you were asked, "do you think there are aliens on Mars",what would you say? Would you bring up the topic of the famed Face of Mars, if you said yes? Well stop, because that is false information. Just read this short essay and change your mind about the subject of aliens.

In 1976 the Viking 1 sent a picture of a supposed face. NASA, shortly after getting the image, then made a false testimony stateing that an alien carved face is on Mars. The now famous image of Mars took a name The Face. Now twenty-two years later NASA tries again at a picture of The Face. The picture turns out good, but a cloud blocks a part of the image. The people aren't happy and they get NASA, three years later to get another picture, and it it shows no evidence of an alien carved face. The talk of The Face soon dies down.

So to sum up what happened, in 1976 the Viking 1 sends a picture of a "face". NASA states that this is an alien's doing. The image recieves the name The Face. Twenty-two years later NASA tries again, and gets a good picture, but a cloud blocks the right side. The people aren't happy. Once again NASA takes another picture, and there is no face. So after reading this you still have your opinion, or you just changed it, but I firmly believe that alien life is a hoax.
