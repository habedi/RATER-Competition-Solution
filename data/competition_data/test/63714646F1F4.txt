Dear Principal,

You have changed the policy of the school so that students can only play sports if they have a grade B average or higher. I think that you should highly recommend changing this policy back to having a grade C average to be able to play sports. I have a few reasons for this suggestion ,and I hope you see this situation from a different perspective.

First of all, our sports teams here at our school don't have that many people participating in them as it is. Most of the students that are interested in the sports have a grade C average. If you make it so they can't play we might not even have sport teams. The kids would be outraged and so would the parents.

Second of all, if we change the policy to a grade B average I think that it would cause students' grades to drop. There are students who want to play sports who are struggling as it is to get their grades to a C average. If we bump up the grade average, there will be some kids who are motivated to get better grades, but others, who are already struggling to get a grade C average, to give up. It could increase the good grades or it could diminish them. Do you want to take the chance?

Lastly, if we have no sports teams, the popularity of our school would go down. Without a sports team we would be losing kids who are athletic. Losing kids in our economy could cause the school to shut down. Students would then have to go out of their way to get to a different school. There would be no public transportation available for them, kids who walk to school would not be able to get to school because it would be too far away, and parents who take their kids to school would be using more gas. We should be trying to conserve gas, a limited resource.

In conclusion, I think that changing the policy would only worsen our school academically and in sports. Keeping things the way they are could push the athletic kids who are struggling with grades to strive to be on the team without thinking it is an impossible task. A loss of sports teams could cause school popularity to drop and threaten the closing of our school. Please consider changing the policy back to the way it was before so that we don't have to worry about what could happen. We know how our old policy works, and we know that it works well. We don't know what could happen if we change the policy. Please, don't take the risk. Th

Sincerely,
