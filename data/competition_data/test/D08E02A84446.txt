Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Many students enjoy participating in sports and activities after school. They look forward to it and possibly have a deep passion for a particular sport, activity. It may be a good thing that they have something that they enjoy fairly well but in my opinion I think school is way more important and should come first. I agree about changing school policy that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Although many students may have a grade C average I think they can improve and bump up their grade to a B.

To begin with, one reason why I think students education should come first before a sport or school activity is so that they can learn for the future and be able to get a good paying job when their older. The school sport or activity may be fun but students can pursue it after they have at least a B average grade. Having a decent education is highly important and I don't think students take it seriously because they're focused on the sport/activity.

In addition, if students are so focused on something else that they aren't getting good grades then it isn't setting them up well for in the future. They won't be able to get a good paying job when they're an adult. Without a job you don't have money to take care of yourself and provide for yourself. Also, you can't just rely on somebody else to take care of you your whole life, that won't work.

Not to leave out, if students would just simply focus on getting good grades in school they will do extremely well in their adulthood. They could have a elegant house, snazzy gadgets, go on exotic vacations, buy whichever car you desire getting, basically you could be living a extraordinary life. I think that's way better than relying on someone else to take care of you, buy your food, clothes, things you (want), not need. I'm pretty sure you'll have to be really lucky to find somebody to do that for you!

In conclusion, I agree that students shouldn't be able to participate in sports or school activities unless they have a B grade average. In order to graduate, go to college, have whichever job you want or would like you have to have close to perfect grades. Without going to college it will be fairly hard to find a job that will give you good money. You'll have to work your butt off in order to take care of yourself especially your family. Education is SO important and students need to pay more intention in school, not be distracted by sports or other school activities. Grades come first then you can have fun afterwards.
