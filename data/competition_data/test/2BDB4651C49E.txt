Dear Principle,

I think that you should require community service. Because it helps students understand why its a good thing to do and it also helps others in need. Some of my friends do community service like tutoring young kids and picking up litter.

The first reason why students should help their community is that they need to know its a good thing to do for others and themselves. When students are helping out with community service everybody looks up to them, because what they are doing is good. They then realize that community service is a good thing and will start doing community service in their free time. They could pick up litter, or paint a mural around the school or somewhere that needs those things done.

The second reason why students should be required to do community service is, that they need to realize that helping others is a good thing for them to do. Even if they don't know the person it helps them build character as they get older. The students should go to nursing homes and keep the older people company, like read them a story or talk to them about their past.

Since some of my friends do community service I believe that it would help students all over the world. My friends do all sorts of things. They tutor young children and pick up litter, because they think it is the right thing to do. Which I believe to. They now have life skills that they will have as long as they live, because of the community service they do.

This is why you should require community service at our school for students. Because it helps them get to know older or younger people. They also realize that helping in their community is a good thing to do, and that they build life skills when they are helping others. When they are working together on something, even if it is as simple as picking up litter. Small things that people do step by step get them somewhere in life, while other people have work harder.

Sincerely,
