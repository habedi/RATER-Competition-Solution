Schools nowadays, can be very stressful as well confusing. The alternative for students attending schools are the ability to attend online classes at home. Attending school online is beneficially and can help students better and more efficiently. Although public, charter and private schools have been the primary source for education for years, online school can help students by keeping it self-paced, provide one-on-one help if needed and it takes away the physical stress of school and replaces it with the relaxation of home. Extending and allowing more classes to be available online will effect a students' ability to learn greatly, in a positive way.

In schools, there are nothing but due date or a dead line for everything. Many students take other rigorous classes or participate in extracurricular activities outside of school that can be time consuming on top of attending school eight hours a day on average. Students can struggle with turning in assignments on time, because of the overbearing weight of other assignments due, forcing them to pull all-nighters; resulting in a lack of sleep which can effect how the brain learns, comprehends and remembers things. Giving students the option to take online classes allow for a more self-paced schedule. Online classes are fit to each students schedule individually and can help them stay on track. They know that students are busy with other activities and/or classes and giving a deadline weeks in advance can help students prioritize and perfect their work. Schools that give a student a week or a couple of days to complete a huge assignment are asking kids to not give their work time, which can result in students not giving their best work. By using online classes, the work will be self-paced which can help students not feel so stressed as many schools make them feel.

Online classes can provide a more one-on-one teaching environment rather than schools. In schools, there is an estimated average of about twenty-five kids to one teacher in each class. Asking for help in a classroom is often hard and teachers do not go into depth due to the vast amount of kids they need to help. Online classes allow for a one-on-one teacher and student chat; often over video-call. This can allow for students to fully understand the process by asking as many questions or problems as nessasary, without feeling rushed or confused. In public schools, there is always a chance to meet with a tutor that may help but, tutors can often be expensive and hard to arrange days where both student and tutor are free to meet up for help. In classrooms, students can sometimes feel embarrassed for not understanding the lesson taught and may not get help due to the negative attention it can cause. Having the option to get one-on-one help via video-call gives a chance for the student to get help with no distractions, resulting in a more understanding and more educated student.

Public schools start early in the morning, with constant learning and no times for the brain to take a break and intake/process the information learned before having to switch and move to a new topic. Teenagers especially, stay up late doing homework and do not get enough sleep, resulting in their brains not having the the ability to soak in and fully understand the information learned. Classrooms hold many distractions such as students disrupting the lesson and random acts that may disrupt a students' ability to learn/focus. Online classes allow for a safer, quieter environment for students to learn and focus on the task in hand. The comfort of their own home takes the classroom factor, including the distractions and makes it easier to focus and do their work. Being at home allows for the student to take as many breaks as needed and takes out the rushing factor that schools bring in. Online schools provide a more relaxed/comforting environment to complete work.

Many students find it difficult to focus during schools, due to the feeling of constantly feeling rushed, which can affect their ability to perfect their work, lack of help in school and the stressfulness of being in school, constantly getting fed information, given no time to digest it. By allowing students the option to attend their classes online, it can help fix all these problems. There will be an increase in good grades, as well as a decrease in stress levels. Overall, much happier and better students.
