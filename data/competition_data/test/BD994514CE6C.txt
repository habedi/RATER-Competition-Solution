Does the online or video conferencing have a benefit on long distance student ? some people believe that online classes does not have any benefit because it is hard to focus an hour or more on a device ,most of the students feel sleepy when they watch long videos ,and they can easily cheat .However, I believe that online classes for the distance learning is a great way to learn because it save much time and money ,less drop out, less illiteracy ,and good for adults and students (who have babies or jobs)

Less drop out .A vivid example .I have a friend . she was a student at Northern Community College. she was an A,B student. one time, her mom was sick .she could not move her body parties or even talk to them. so she couldn't leave her mom or her younger brothers alone and go to her college. she did not go to her class three time . after that she went back to her class but she find herself out of that class she tried to explain to her professor but he did not pay any attention. she stayed outside to meet him after the class but he did not even believe her. she tried to do many things but she could not .she was in her second year and it was the end of her semester. she can not graduate without that class so they told her that she has to stay one more year. so she decide to dropout of her classes and work.

Save much time and money . For example :my sister college is three hours away form our home. our dad does not allow us to be away from home for any issue (reason) even college . so she has to drive every three days six hour ( back and force). she does not like drive , but she has to . by taking her classes online so she will save all that time and she will safe money by not paying for her gas every week . and she will work more hours and save .it also will positive effect in the environment by less the pollution and the traffics.

less illiteracy. It also good for adults (for girls that has a babies. and boys who have to work instead or learn),In my experience, my mom long time ago was in college ,but after i came to the life she could not go her college as usual anymore because she does not have anyone that she can leave me with instead of my dad , and my dad was working two jobs. and she could not take me with her. unfortunately she leave her classes. she is penitent and she always telling me that "if these opportunity was in that time, she would not drop out ".

So, that is why online and video classes is a great opportunity for all of us because it saves many hours and our gas ,more college student will graduate on time ,and adult or moms educations . by doing this opportunity we will progress. all the students in a long or a short distance,have or have not babies will take their classes anywhere they prefer and anytime they want even at the midnight.
