I believe that students should be allowed to have there phones on campus. Why? Well, most students have emergency cases and have to get a hold of somebody at all times. Some students don't really have an emergency at all. They just want to text friends, social networks, or family members just for fun. Not for there education.

If you were to say no phones at all, some students would probably break the rules anyways to text social networks, friends, or parents. Some students have to get a hold of their parents for an emergency and cannot reach them through the schools phones, so if that were the case I'd say, yeah, let them bring a phone. Most of the time that is not the case because the students just want to have a phone on them to take pictures of their friends to post on social networks or text friends instead of doing their class work.

In my opinion, I think you allow the students to have their phones because in reality most of them are going to sneak them in anyways. As long as the phones are off during class periods I think that having phones wouldn't be a problem. Some students have to call or text someone immediately and cannot wait until class is over, so it would be okay to contact someone at home or related to the student as long as they have the teachers permission. Also, some students are really sick and cannot get to the nurse, so they should be able to contact somebody to come and get them.
