I think kids doing community service is a go idea. Today kids are to lazy and need to be put to work. Some kids will disagree with this but it will be better them to better future. The kids will be helping make the world green. Children will feel better know that there helping the world, old people, and fixing thing that may have been broken. By doing this we help child learn the mean of hard work.

Kids will know how hard it is to work. The smart and strong kids are the better and faster they can make to be. We need child that don't mind doing chores like washing dish or taking out the trash. There would be no granting. It's not that bad doing community service there all way aware at the in. That aware is knowing you did some thing good.

Kids to day think it is to much work but doing something good is always wore it. My opinion is that kids should do community service because it right.
