Venus simple to see from a distants but very hard to see up close. Astronomers are very facinated by this planet. Before venus had an average temperature over 800 degrees fahrenhit and an atmostphereic pressure that is 90 times greater than ours is here on earth. Astronomers think it was alot like earth with big oceans and they think it could have supported forms of life like we have here. NASA is working on other approaches to study venus. "Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been testeed in a chamber simulationg the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for 3 weeks in these conditions"(venus 7). This is a challenge that Scientist and astronomers should definetly look into. "Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"(venus 8).
