Distance Learning

The program of education for schools, had develop a way for the students to attend classes from home. Distance Learning , is a program that allows students from an specific region, that has approved this method to assits class by home. They required the students to have access to internet and a computer, because the assignment for the class will be provided in a file with instructions by the teacher in charge of it. I desagree with the distance learning program that would not benefit the students, becuase the better method for learning is seeing the person and oral explenation about the topic giving examples and interaction in the classroom.

First, the distance learning program, can create communication barries. As all the assignmemt are post it online, the student will be most of the time working and doing activities alone. Taking the program at home, he or she won't have the opportunity to demostrate the abillity to work as a team. In result, the issolation of communication can cause conflict in future jobs, as certain jobs assign to work with a partner to find a soluton or to interact with the different ideas that each one has.

Second, distraction in the learning process. Distraction can happen any time while the student is working in the class material. The computer is the essential tool for the work field, and an eassy method for distractions. As the computer have access to internet the student can open many windows at once as, video games, facebook, and many other social media apps with out being notice by the teacher making the learning process longerÂ to complete. No having an educator that supervise his/hers process in work can lead the accumulation of work and the grade might decrease.

Lastly, distance learning program, can cause unscrupulous work. As the assignment are online, and the teacher can not monitor the correct procedure that the students are applying in their assignemts it can cause consecuences. The understament and knowledgemet can be questionable by the teacher, when the student is presenting a well knowledge in homework, but not in thes test of every unit. All this can result in an alegation by the teacher to the student in the way of he/she is not using the rule of plygiarism.

In conclusion, there is not benefit from the students in attending class from from home, becuase it is not productive for the students in certain ways. The correct process of doing class material, is not garanty to a hundred percent. the students can cheat and forget the use plagarize easely. For this reason I do not consider the use of distance learning in the field of education.
