Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Some might do this because students have a lot of time during the summer. Summer projects keep the students mind active during the summer. This insures that they are ready for school in the fall. Opponents incorrectly believe summer projects should be teacher designed because they can grade it and they have the year's lesson plan. Although some believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects are to be student designed.

Due to summer projects being student designed it can benefit a student. It benefits a student because they can learn more about themselves. Learning more about themselves is when someone finds something inside them they did not know about. For example, if a person tries a new activity or topic they can find that they actually like it. Summer projects designed by students can help them learn about themselves by letting them try new things. Additionally, it benefits them because they can learn time management skills. Time management skills is a skill that helps you mange your time and not waste it. For example, if a student knows his homework is due the next week they will slowly do it so it will be done. Summer projects designed by themselves help them learn time management. Furthermore, it benefits them because they can do it off of their interests. Doing things off of interests is when someone does something because they like it. For example, if a person likes football and they had to choose what they had to paint most likely it would be football. This benefits them because interests gives people purpose and without purpose there is no need to do things.

Because of summer projects being student designed it benefits their academics. Moreover, it benefits them because students can learn more. Learning more is when students improve their knowledge beyond what they know already. For instance, a person that wants to know a little more about people they can read a biography about them. Student designed projects allow students to learn more about their projects because they are interested. In addition, it benefits their academics because they are more willing to learn. Having the will to learning is learning without someone having to tell you. For example, a person that is willing to learn is someone that does not mind learning and they do not care to. Students will be willing to learn if they are creating it. Secondly, it benefits the academics be they can learn to be independent. Being independent is when you are able to do or think on your own. For instance, if a person is independent he can think for himself and can do things without help from others. When the students make their own projects they have to think for themselves in order for it be done.

Even though some believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects are to be student designed. The opposition wrongly believes summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers know what they are doing and they have more experience. However, it should be known summer projects are to be student designed because it benefits students by using their interests, time management, and learning more and themselves. Additionally, summer projects designed by students benefit students academics by learning more, more willing to learn, and learning to be independent. All schools should add projects to summer break so students can keep their mind active.
