Have you ever had any extracurricular classes? Well if you have do you agree with the following statement. Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with this decision because it will make it harder for kids to do any homework that they have left or projects that they have to finish. I will also make it harder for the students if they are failing in the extracurricular class. It will also make the school lose money because they have to buy extra equipment for the extracurricular classes.

Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with this decision because it will make students do extra work that they dont want to do it will also make student overwhelmed with work and all the classes that they have have to go to. It could also makes students be disinterested in school in what they have learn. It will also make teachers have to do even more because they have to teach the extracurricular classes.

In conclusion have you ever had an extracurricular classes and if so how did this paragraph make you feel and how does it relate to you.
