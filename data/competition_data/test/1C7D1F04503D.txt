Students who struggle in school find it to be exhausting or even stressful, but participating in extracurricular activities may change their mind. Educating students may set them up for success in the future but can also put them at a worrisome situation to finish work on time and get projects done. Students who ask questions and seek for help may be overwhelmed and have trouble understanding the concept, in this situation students need to take their mind off this and do something to relieve them of their troubles. Extracurricular activities can impact students by relieving their stress, improving a more positive mindset, and finally having a chance to make new friends.

School educates students about subjects that may be useful to have later in their lives, while this can be helpful it can also be stressful. Being in an extracurricular activity such as soccer club may gives students an opportunity to have fun and play with their friends, by doing this it can be enjoyable and take away stress from school. Although school is overwhelming sometimes, extracurricular activities make students embrace an opportunity that takes away all stress and helps them focus on exciting activities. By relieving stress the students will feel that they can achieve all the work given to them, this will boost their confidence knowing they can do anything.

Sometimes students might give up on their confidence because of all the work they have to get done. An extracurricular activity such as working on the yearbook can help students focus on an activity that helps them believe they are capable of achieving anything. Building confidence, having a better self esteem, and believing in yourself, are all important steps to having a more positive mindset, this impacts students because it helps students get their work done and doesn't have them worry about stressing out. A positive and confident mindset is one of the most important steps to achieve future goals, by being more confident anything can be accomplished.

The final reason why participating in an extracurricular activity is there will be plenty of people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. Beside all the fun and activities to do in different clubs there will also be people to work with and a chance to make some new friends. By making new friends it will improve one's mindset socially and is another way to deal with stress because when having new friends it can make someone feel happy and excited. Dealing with stress isn't an easy task, but a way to being happier is to make new friends.

School can be stressful sometimes, but with extracurricular activities the amount of stress should be decreased. Extracurricular activities such as sports clubs, working on the year book, or even serving on student council are all opportunities for students to direct their focus on having fun instead of being overwhelmed by all the work. Being positive, relieving stress, and making new friends are all effective ways to not be overwhelmed in school, instead students should embrace going to school because of all the opportunities given.
