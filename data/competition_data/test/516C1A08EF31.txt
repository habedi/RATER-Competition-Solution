Dear Principal,

I personally take a position that students should be required to perform community service. There are lots of reasons why I think this. The biggest issue in the community is that you go outside to walk your dog or to walk to the store and all you see it litter on the streets and sidewalks. You physically see people littering all the time which is a bad cause to the community and then other people that are not trashing the community have to pick up after other people. If a police see someone littering they could possible get a fine because its illegal but people still do it. On the other hand there will be a group of people together and think its a joke and fun to go around throwing their trash on the ground and around Halloween time smashing peoples pumpkins in the streets. If i was with a group of people like that I would be the bigger person because I care about the community and i would either tell them to stop or pick it up and find a trash barrel. What I would do is probably give them some advice about littering or just not go around them again or try to get them to do community service along with others.

The big reason why I think that all students should be required to perform community service is that if everyone all went around picking up trash that people think is okay to throw in streets and sidewalks then we would have a clean environment in our community. We would probably have groups of people to go around together so no one gets lost or hurt and we` d do it everyday around 4:00. For the children that are younger they would need to have an adult with them so nothing happens. If we would have this in our community I think that people would get the idea that others want a clean community and maybe the people that do litter in the community would stop. If we saw someone littering there would be some consequences that the city has made. I think that helping the community is very important because I want a clean environment and hopefully others do to. Students should definitely get together and clean up the community i think it would be fun and at the same time for the people that are doing it they should be very proud of themselves for helping out and sticking up for the community.
