DEAR MISS PRICIPLE,

I 100% disagree with this new policy idea of yours for many reasons.

Many students get there home work and protects done but they get like a C grade average on the assignment. It is there choice to redo it or to talk to a teacher if they want or need a good grade. But I don't think you should punish them with sports! say if one kid did an assignment with a friend and they had to go up in front of the class and do it together but your friend was acting like a total spas and dropped your grade to a C (when it was an A) they should do sports but give them time to redo it.

However if one person has a D or an F in math, science, health, or social studies then you should talk to them. See why they have that and how they can improve in that class. And if they don't have that grade up in 2 or 3 weeks talk to them again and maybe kick them out if they arnt doing anything to improve or show that they are making progress don't punish the kids who have an A or a B and even a C.

some people find it hard to fit all this room into homework studying tests and quizzes. so if they have a C that's because they might not have time to do so. some people have school, dance, friends, lessons, sports , piano and etc.

If you go up to 50 students i bet you at least 38 will say and give you an excellent argument on this discussion and say that you as a principle and others of the school faculty should NOT allow D and below grade average to participate in school sports and if they have a C give them lots of time on there hands to redo and update the grade report. I know you will see improvement!!

love: me as a student (not naming names!)
