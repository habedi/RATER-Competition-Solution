In the article " Making Mona Lisa Smile,'' the author describes how a new technology called the facial Action coding system enables compututers to identify human emotions. I feel this technology can be useful but weird,Because it can help peopel be able to want to learn,but make you like the computer is watching 24/7. An example on how it can help is an paragraph 5-9. Paragraph 5 gives us facts and why we should use the computer. Paragraph 6 says the computer will bring you a smile that a little werid to werid. paragraph 7 give steps you should try out. Paragraph 8 gives us examples,and 9 says Did the computer bring a smile to your face. Like to me no its just to much their a computer that understands you,dont that make you fell weird. Like computer are becoming more human then us. And that scarys me more then anything like i cant have a computer watching me 24/7. but dont get me wrong this could be great as i said,this can help people who dont like to learn want to learn to better themselfs. Like i am right in the middle like its ok,but i dont trust it one bit at all. Like 1-9 Just makes me feel my computer is watching me now as i do a test. Like i l know technology is growing but the technology ias become more human then it already is.
