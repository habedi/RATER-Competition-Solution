Imagine sitting bored and alone at a computer all day, becoming distracted by the smallest noises. When taking online classes, the only person you can depend on to focus and get work done is yourself. Although taking classes online allows self paced learning, attending a school is more beneficial because you have a structured schedule, you are being taught in person, and there is less room for distractions.

One reason attending a school is more beneficial is because of the structured schedule. Human's brain's like organization, and having a structured schedule allows this. Structured schedules make it easier for students to remember which classes they have and when. It also allows them to know how long they have to complete assignments, so they can plan ahead and make sure the assignments are turned in on time. This is convenient because it allows students to space out their work, and it creates less stress.

Another reason attending a school is more beneficial is due to being taught in person. Human's retain information better when they process the information they are hearing, along with when they take notes. Having a teacher present also allows students to ask questions so they can further elaborate on material they don't understand. This is beneficial to students because they are more likely to retain material when they are being taught, so it becomes more meaningful and will have a greater impact on students lives later on.

Lastly, attending a school is more beneficial because there are less distractions. If you were teaching yourself at home, you could easily stop working and participate in more entertaining activities whenever you got tired of doing work. However, in a school this isn't an issue because students are required to stay in class, and they aren't allowed to have electronics or other distracting material out unless it is needed. Because there are less distractions in a school, it provides a better learning experience for students and a growth in attention span, and they are more likely to complete work on time.

Although participating in online classes allows students to learn at a pace that is good for them, attending a school is more beneficial. In a school environment there are the benefits of having a structured schedule, being taught in person, and having less distractions. This is important because having those benefits allows for a better learning experience for students, and they are more likely to be successful later in life.
