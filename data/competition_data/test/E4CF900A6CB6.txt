Dear Principal,

I disagree (With many other students) about this "possible" policy change. We (as students) think that it would be acceptable if we were able to do sports and other activities even if we didn't have higher than a B average because it depends on the students talent and interests.

I think it depends on the students talent because (for example) if the person that wanted to do basketball and was one of the top players, and they had a C-/D+ average and is not that good in their classes because they aren't interested in that, then there would be a problem. Which connects talent and interests in a student. The student could be interested in everything to do with school, but not be interested in sports, they would be able to do sports and extra curricular activities, but it would just go to waste if they were not interested in any of that type of stuff.

If the policy doesn't change and that student who has a C/D average was able to play basketball, then the school would also have to support because if that person was able to play; it would probably help our school out a lot at basketball games because they would be a good player.

So, as you can see, changing the regular policy would be not be a better choice for this school, and also the interests and talents these student have. Thank you.
