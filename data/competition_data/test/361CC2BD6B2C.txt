Dear Mr. Senator,

The Electoral College is a unfair system used for voting the reprentative of our nation. Bigger states with a bigger population get more votes, and smaller states get less votes. Its not completely fair, but then again when is politics fair? If the majority of big states are all a certain paty (either democrst or republican) them the entire system is thrown off, unfair, and unbalanced. Its much more fair if the people of the United States vote amd the votes were to be counted as individuals and not grouped to see which has the greater percentage and then given a certain number of votes to that party's candidate.

Although the process I think will be fair does include greater numbers, the government has equipment such as computers to do the counting for each person. This system is rigged and unjust. It is the opposite of what America and its foundation is all about - equality. I would like yout to take this to washington and even if you get scrutinized and pestered, you should ride forth because lots of Americans think this system is corrupt and if we want our voices and opinions to be heard there is no one else we can tell but you. So represent us small town people of LOCATION_NAME, represent the nation in undergoing a process that will finally make our country one of equality.

Sincerely,

GENERIC_NAME
