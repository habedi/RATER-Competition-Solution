I really don't like this new computer thing at all. i think that it is something private and I wouldn't want to have somebody look at my emotions and see what I am feeling. What about if somebody is sad but they just don't want to talk about it. Somebody might bring it up in class saying "PROPER_NAME is sad" or "What's wrong with PROPER_NAME" I would not want to have a teacher ask me what's wrong in front of all of my classmates. I can see it if people might want to use it to see if the students are bored with their class work but other than that I would not like it at all.

For example, when the author says "The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face. while it shows just how much the computer can do." i don't agree with that at all it should be your right to say that you don't want to have people ask if you are okay. This new computer would not make me smile it would make me angry. I think that they should only do it on paintings and not on real life people. I also think if they do this new computer thing a lot of people would be angry,

In conclusion, i do not like the idea of the computer where it can tell what emotions you are feeling. It is an invasion of your pricavy. Like I said before they should only do it on paintings and not on real life people.
