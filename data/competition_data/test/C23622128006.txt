The Principal at our school has recently made an announcement that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity. But, is that a good thing? Well I at least think so. I agree with the principal because extracurricular activities like sports, cubs, and the year book have positive effects on us students. For example.

Sports, sports help us students physically and mentally by encouraging dedication, self confidence,team work, and hard work. For example, when we are in sports we must be dedicated to getting better and actually put in the work to get better. And sports help us with self confidence cause we do our own part and that effects the whole team. It helps because we must learn to be confident in our self to help the team in the best way possible. Team work is one thing that is displayed in sports. Us and our team mates must work together so that the team is the best it can be. Hard work also plays a role in sports because we must work hard to get our skills and our body in a position to be able to do the best we can. And last but not least it helps us create bonds and relationships with our team. Our sports team is like family and the thicker and stronger the bond is the better and more prosperous our team becomes.

Clubs are also good extracurricular activities because when we participate in them we learn new things, we get to know people, and we get to have fun. There is a club for a lot of things and it is an amazing place to learn new stuff and we thrive off of it. Clubs are also a good place for us to find new friends and they have a good chance to like very similar things as us and might just become one of our best friends. And clubs are also really fun. I love nature, helping people, chess, video games, etc. and if there is a club for it i can have fun. And so can you.

The yearbook making is also an extracurricular activity, and its cool too. Because we get to exercise our creativity by creating cool Desines and chose the outcome of the cosmetics to the yearbook. We also get to know the people we work with. Also maybe become friends with the people we work with, and it is always good to make a friend right. But if thats not good enough, we would just be helping and if your a student or your child likes helping just as much as I do, creating the year book would be perfect.

So if you disagree with the principals decision maybe rethink your decision. Because sports, clubs, creating the yearbook, or any other extracurricular activities benefit us in so many ways like. Teamwork, determination, self confidence, creativity, friends, and fun. So maybe consider signing up or signing up your kid for one of the extracurricular activities. And give it a try before you fight against it.
