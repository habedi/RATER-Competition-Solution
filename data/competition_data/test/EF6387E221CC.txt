Its Just A Landform

NASA recently has just seen a human looking face on Mars, NASA has an image of the "Face" and they have released it for public view. People have questioned "Was it created by aliens?" So many people believe that it was indeed created by aliens. I believe that it is just a natural landform and it just so happened to look like a human face, for these many reasons.

In the article "Unmasking Face on Mars" it states that many people believe that this is not just a landform, it is some kind of alien creation. But, i can tell you otherwise. In stanza 3 it says, "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." It clearly says,"formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." That can give you an image of how the shadows could have formed this face like creation.

Another reason for this not being an alien cretaion as it states in stanza 7 of this article,"thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."This is a great reason for people to realize that it is not an alien creation. After a team captured another photo but ten times sharper, than the original Viking photos, they finally saw that it was nothing more than a natural landform and it must've been shadows that created such human like looks, as I already stated and also as stated in the article.

Although, people will still think it was an alien creation and NASA is keeping it away from the public, we are highly not. There has been no sight of any alien activity what so ever. The "Face" is not a start of alien activity and probably never will be.

In conlusion, this so called "alien creation" is not an alien creation. I know and believe it is not an alien creation, due to those reasons that I have named above. This human face looking creation is only and nothing more a natural landform.
