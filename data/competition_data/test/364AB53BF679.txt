Community service is volunteer work and should not be required from students. It should be something that we volunteer for and something that we want to do. Community service takes a lot of time, takes away from homework, takes time away from other activities, and should be a choice.

Community service takes up a lot of time and should only be done if the student wants to do it. Some people may say that it is a good thing to do and will help teach students to help others, but it can take time that could be used for school work. Students will get less school work done and have a lot of missing assignments. They could do them, but they will have to stay up late and will be tired and unable to focus during class. Community service can also take away time from other activities.

If we are required to do community service we will have less time for after school activities like sports. It is important to do sports and other activities because it teaches us about teamwork and helps us with our social skills. It is important to help the community, but it should be done during any free time that we have and not all the time so we can get the required hours for school. Sports also provide physical activity to help us stay healthy and fit. Without sports, many students may become overweight. community service should be done because the person wants to do it and wants to help the community.

We should do community service because we want to not because we have to. it is not right to make someone do it. Doing community service should be extra credit or optional for people. CommuniSome people could think that it should be done so we can help out people in the community, but it shouldn't just be students that have to do it. All people in the community should be helping out. It would be unfair to make students do it. Community service should be a choice not.

Students should not be required to do community service. If students want to do t should be their choice. It takes away from school work, after school activities, and should be our choice to do. Community service is a good thing to do and students should do it, but it should not be enforced. Therefore I believe that we should not be required to do community service.
