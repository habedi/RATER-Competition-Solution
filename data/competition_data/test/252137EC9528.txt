Principle

I think that you should let us participate in sports with an average of a C because we try hard anyways if we are in sports or not but i think that's no fair well for me its not maybe because im not that good at school but for other people because i always like to play sports in school so i can support my team and all my grades are almost a B almost only but they are C and i would love that you would let us play sports at least if we are passing our grades with a D, but at the same time you are correct because some kids don't go to tutoring and fail their classes and they still want to play sports and that's not good but for me and not just me all the people that have C almost B you should let us play and the team and represent our school, another reason why you should let us play sports its to get distracted and have fun but its only fair for us the people that have C because the people that have D and F they don't deserve being in the team like the rest of us, i go to tutoring when i need to go because its not only important to pass my classes to be in the team also because i want to make my parents be proud of me, anyways you could let us play at least with almost a B because i love football and soccer and i always get in those sports but now they are not letting me be in the soccer team because i have a C in almost all of a classes and that's not fair because i try my best to pass my classes for being in the team and now i cant be in the team because of those C but i will try to ask my teachers for extra work so i can go all the way to an A and be in the soccer team, but like i told you its fair for some of them and its not fair for the rest of us that want to be in the team so i would say that you should let us play and just tell us to don't have D or low C, i have high C that's why im telling you this if i would of have low C and D i wouldn't even be here telling you this so what do you say are you going to let us play in sports or other activities with C or you are going to let only the people that have only A and B?
