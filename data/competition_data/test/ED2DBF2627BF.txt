Dear principle,

Cell phone use during school has always been a popular subject.

Many students would say that being able to use their phones during school is a good idea, but a good amount of teachers and staff would say different.

This dispute has been going on recently and I personally think cell phones should be allowed during school, But on conditions.

Classes should be for class work only.

There should be no distractions in class, many people would agree with that.

Students are in school, not only to meet new people and socialize, but mainly to learn.

I do not think cell phones should be allowed to be used during class time. Using a cell phone during class would take away the interest to listen to the teacher and learn.

All students would be worried about would be texting, when they should concentrate on the lesson.

Therefore cell phones should not be allowed in class.

On the other hand, lunch/recess is supositly students free time.

I see no problem with the privilege of using cell phones during lunch.

Even the use during other free times in the school day would be completely fine and harmless.

During this free time children are not required to learn or do any work.

Cell phones would obviously not be a problem if there is nothing kids should be paying attention to.

Finally if lunch and other free times are for socializing, why not let children bring and use their phones during that time.

Once students lunches were over, they should be made to either turn off their phone or put it back in their locker.

If students did not do that they should be punished and there should be consequence's for not listening to their teachers.

Students usually have to bring their phones to school.

Mainly for after school activities.

Usually children have to find a ride home or consult a parent on how they would get home from the school.

It would not be fair to tell them that they cant bring them at all.

In conclusion, students should be able to use their cell phones, only during lunch or free time.

Students would be happy and possibly more willing to learn.

Teachers also would be happy because they would be made to shut their phones off during class.

This would be a great choice and improvement to the school rules.
