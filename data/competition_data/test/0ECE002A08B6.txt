The face on Mars is just a natural landform because it states in the text that the only reason the rock looks like a face is because it has shadows from the sun, and in this case the shadows give the "face" eyes, mouth, and a nose.

Yes even though there have sightings of UFO's or ( Unidentified Flying Object) the conspiracy theorists say that this face is an alien artifact but it states that the only reason why they say it is a feace is so more people are attracted to Mars.

The landform int a real face because if you compare the "face" to an Earth rock in that shape they would look the same, until you add some light from the sun causing shadows, and it would include the facial parts of any human man or woman.

As you see from paragraph 3 you will see that it states in the last sentence " The author's reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars." Although, it did the scientist thought that tehy have accomplished something huge by tricking people into thinking it was a huge head.

In my conclusion, these are the reasones that the natural landform is not a face.
