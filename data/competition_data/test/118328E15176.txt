Driverless cars are a very impractical design. These cars can not fully drive themselves. It also states that they would add entertainment as you drive. Driverless cars could malfunction, since they run on computers. Driverless cars could be potentially dangerous.

Driverless cars are not fully automated. The name is falsely implied because drivers must stay alert while the car is moving. If there is construction being done or a wreck has taken place, the driver has to maneuver around the traffic. Driverless cars can not be operated without the driver having both hands on the wheel. The idea of driverless cars is not bad, but in order for them to be called "driverless," I believe that they should be automated and not require a driver.

The article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" states that there would be added entertainment while driving, so that the driver would not become bored. This is a bad idea considering that driving, even with the car being automated, requires full attention. It states that a driver would be alerted when they need to take control. The driver could be asleep at this time and may not be able to hear the alert. The driver could also not get the alert all together.

Driverless cars run off of computers. Computers are not alwats perfect, and could often times fail. In the event of this happening, the car could stop, not be stopped, or fail to alert the driver of danger. If the car stops while driving it could create a terrible accident. The car could also not be stopped, and wouldn't be able to avoid the other cars or obey the traffic laws. It could also fail to alert the driver that he/she needs to take over, in case of an emergency. It is a very good concept, but unless the computers could be perfected, it could create a dangerous situation.

Driverless cars are not a bad idea. There could be many flaws involved with the making of driverless cars. I believe that it makes the design useless if it couldn't be fully automated without the use of a driver. The entertainment aspect could make driving a lot more dangerous, instead of safer, like the intended goal. The computers could also just stop working. Driverless cars are not perfect, but the idea could be built on. It all comes down to the drivers personal preference.
