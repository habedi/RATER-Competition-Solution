Online Schools

Some schools offer the option to learn a distance. How this can benefits the students?, and lets see if should be good or should not be good.

Think about students take their classes from their home, and schools disappears. technology change things and now the schools are online. What is the advantages of students. Some say online schools should be good because they don't have to worry about be on time to get the bus. Although, some people say online schools should not be good because they don't going to know how world works, and they can just play games or distract their self with other things on the computer.

it will be good have a school in my house, may be i don't have to wake up early. I don't have to wake up my parents to tell them if they can droop me at school. It will be happier for may students. study in their house with computers, and also they don't have to eat the food of the school. At this day technology is a important tool that we can use for many things, and also adults who don't finish high school can use online school to graduate.

If you think careful online school will have a disadvantages, and students can mess up everything. Some of then will go to study do their home works, but what about others the lazy students. They just going to play games or easily don't enter to the online class.

They will not have some that can push them up. Parents are working, and there is not teacher they going to say "i don't gonna do anything" another fact the online schools is not is they don't practice the responsibility. if they are always in home they will not know how this country (USA) work. Study in home will be fun, but i think is more fun being with your friends out studying together, chill together and do stuff that every teenager do.

Its good to have online classes, and also is good go to the school. At this time you can do both. Like everything online schools have good thing and bad thing as a regular school. If the students know have use even regular schools, or online schools they will graduate.
