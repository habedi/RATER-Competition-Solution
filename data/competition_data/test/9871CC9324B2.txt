Some Schools want students to complete projects during the summer. These projects should be Student-designed because it will make students want to do them,ensure that they actually learn and it will help with their future. It could also set them up for collage or what they plan on doing after Highschool. Here are a few reasons i think the students should get to decide what their project is on.

The first reason is, it will make them more interested. If students can pick their topic or even what they do they might actually want to complete it. A lot of times in School your projects may not be on something your interested in, which makes you not want to do it as much. If you can pick theres no way you wont be interested because you picked the topic. Also if they get to choose what they do as a project, for example community service, essay about someone or something, or doing an internship could be be great things for them to do but they will learn in a fun way.

The next reason is it might help them with a future job. If someone were to do a project on something there interested in as a career it might help them decide if they want to do that. It will also open up possible jobs they didnt even know about but know have a chance to learn about. This could be really good for kids unsure about their future. This could even land them a job before they leave high schoolÂ which sets them up well for the future. It will set them up for collage also.

The last reason would be good grades. In schools kids dont always get good grades. Part of the reason this happens is because their not interested in the topic. It can be hard to study something you dont like and do well on it. If the students made the choice they could pick whatever they wanted and could really have a good time doing this project. If students decided on their own project the teachers could really get an understanding of how that students actually preforms, not how they do in class on something the dont like.

Allowing students to decide their project could really allow for them to show their true potential. This project will not only help kids be more interested in what thy are learning about it will also help with the future out of Highschool and maybe even their grades in school. In conclusion a Student decided project will benefit the kids the most.
