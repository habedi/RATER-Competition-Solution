Kids should be outside having fun witrh friends, throwing water balloons, going to the beach; or even playing outside in a basketball court on a sunny summer day. Time should be spent with family enjoying the time they have off from school. Students spend about eight to nine months in school every year and have only about two months for vacation out of school. Homework, projects, or any sort of summer assignments should really just stay in school, and not in the way of any students period of time during summer. Being forced to have an assignment complete during summer should be optional to a student and not teachers, to assure kids to continue learning during their break; their summer projects should be student designed.

A student designed project over summer will have them stessing less, and yet more comfertable completing the proect.
