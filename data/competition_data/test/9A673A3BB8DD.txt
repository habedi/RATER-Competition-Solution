In most schools, students are staying after school doing after school activities. But, sometimes students aren't able to do any after school activities. Some of the reasons could be that the student may already do something after school or, the students may not be able to do the extracurricular activities physically or mentally. Another reason is the student simply just does not have the time to do any after school activities.

One reason, could be that students may not have the time to do any after school activities because they may already do something after school. For instance, they may have to help around with chores or they may have to babysit etc. There are a lotÂ of things a student have if they can't do any after school activities. Like, he or she may have to do a project, do missing work or have to do homework. Most likely, they just physically or mentally can't do any extracurricular activities.

One reason, could be that a student could have therapy or a regime that they have to keep up after school. Most likely, they could be disabled physically or mentally that make them unable to stay after school for any activity. Also, sometimes student just simply can not stay after school for any activity.

Another reason could be they just cant stay after school. For instance, this could be due because of transportation reasons like, he or she are getting picked up by there parents or sibling or guardian who ever and it could be that after the person who picked up the student have to work or where ever that is important.

I know that having an after school could be fun and healthy for the student but sometimes its just could not be possible for the student.

Even though, some students may not be able to do any after school activities. There are still a lot of other students that can do extracurricular activities.
