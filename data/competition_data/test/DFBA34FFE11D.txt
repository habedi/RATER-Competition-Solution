Should students participate in an extracurricular activity? It may seem like a simple question, but there are actually many different answers to this question. Personally, I think that each student can benefit from joining in on an extracurricular. These may include clubs such as Soccer Club or Harry Potter Club, or maybe something like the school newspaper and Student Council. Each of these can provide a positive impact for every person who joins. I think that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they can help kids make and create new friendships, urge someone to develop a new skill, and encourage students to go outside of their comfort zone.

One way an extracurricular activity can benefit a student is by helping them to create new friendships, or maybe become closer with someone they normally wouldn't. For example, I have a friend who is a member of the Nintendo Club at our school. She is the only girl in the club, yet she has made new and unexpected friends through this experience. There are many different types of people who come together for these activities, so when a person joins in they can meet someone who has the same interests and hobbies. Unexpected friendships can be born through the simple action of attending an extracurricular.

A second positive outcome to participating in an extracurricular is the chance to develop a new skill. Another friend of mine loved to draw and write, but wasn't really a fan of sports. Recently, he decided to attend the Basketball Club and ended up loving it! He has continued to go to Basketball Club, and his skills have increased greatly. Although it may take some time, one can eventually develop a new and fun skill which they normally wouldn't have. Additionally, if someone has multiple skills and talents, that can increase their self esteem. A lot of students have insecurities and worry about not fitting in, however, when they gain a new skill this can boost the way they see themselves and increase their confidence.

The last way a student can benefit from participating in an extracurricular is by encouraging them to step outside of their comfort zone. I think that going outside of your comfort zone is something most people are not comfortable with doing, including myself. Over the summer, my brother switched soccer teams and this was very hard for him. Between having to leave his old team behind and adjusting to the new atmosphere, this new change was very difficult for him. As time went on, and he kept pushing himself outside of his comfort zone, and he had acclimated and adapted to the new environment. Now, my brother is so happy that he decided to go beyond what he was used to and loves his team. Even though this situation wasn't about anÂ extracurricular, they are both related. When a student joins a new club, they may be very nervous. But when someone makes the decision to try something new and take that scary step outside of their comfort zone, there will be many rewards in return. One of which is when people try new things, it can lead them to be successful in the future and inspire others to do the same thing.

To conclude, there are multiple benefits for a person who makes the choice to participate in an extracurricular. These include the chance to make new friends and meet new people, help students to develop a new skill, and urge someone to take a risk and go outside of their comfort zone. Although some may not want to try an extracurricular, it can impact them in so many positive ways. Should students participate in an extracurricular? I think yes, and if someone takes a risk and joins in on one, they might just think yes as well.
