I feel that driveless cars are needed for the world it would change the world as we know it. In these cars there are sensors that can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

These cars are very important because they can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. The cars can also steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, nut all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

Even though the human driver has to be alert at all times to be ready to take over this necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs. Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in car entertainment and information systems that use heads up displays such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over - something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.

So honestly I feel that dispite some of the flaws that these cars may have it can still keep you safe. Even when you back up your car will let you know if your gonna hit an object such as a car or predestrian.
