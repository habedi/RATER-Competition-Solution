School ended for the day, everyone is tired and bored out of their mind, but at least they're going home! Unless the principal said students need to participate in an extracurricular activity. It's not fair when students might have other plans out side of school as if that's not tiring enough, or have to watch over younger siblings/pets.

Whether it may be sports, scouts, or even volunteer work, it's not fair for the principal to force students to take part in other events after-school as if they don't already have enough on their plate. Someone is coming home from school and they're rushing to get their sports gear on; that takes a bit long to get on not including other accessories included like water bottles, backpacks, training items and more, and now they're late because they had another event before whichever sport they're playing. Say a classmate is not doing so hot in class right now, and the reason is they had multiple activities that took place yesterday. The teacher/staff member want them to do well, but they can't do anything to change this person's mood, due to the fact of all tiring events. Service hours could count as an extracurricular activity, but who said nobody is doing that already? Speaking from experience, scouts get themselves into any volunteering opportunity open. It takes time and work to give back to others, but at least they're fulfilling their duties as a citizen of the community. It's exhausting, and stressful enough with other plans.

Being an only child is easier in this situation, but remember siblings and pets are also a thing too. Siblings, especially younger ones, need to be watched over, taken care of while parents are at work. It's not like anyone can take them to their school all because of staying after. That isn't aloud, or necessary when they have a house for a reason. Pets aren't a need, they're a privilege because of the huge responsibility over them. They need to be walked, fed, and loved especially if it's a baby animal. It's almost like caring for another human, if they were more hairy and spoke an entirely different language. "With great power comes great responsibility" someone once said, and it's pretty impressive youngsters are capable of caring for others besides themselves. A single child in school might not be the only one in their family like described.

Watching over another child/animal, or dealing with exhausting things to do after a long educational period of time, it's not fair to add something on top of someone's plate knowing all of this information. Even though students know different adults believe they can do it, sometimes they just want to catch their breathe for a second and release their stress. Children are capable, but maybe they're not up to the challenge 100% of the time.
