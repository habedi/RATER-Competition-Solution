Some people enjoy doing extracurricular activities, some don't. I do not think that it should be required to do an extracurricular activity. It should not be required to do an extracurricular activity because not everyone has the time, some people like having free time and might not like doing extra things like that, and a lot of people are introverts but extracurricular activities force you to be social.

Not everyone has enough time to do extracurricular activities. Most people have lives outside of school. They could be spending time with their friends doing fun things off of school grounds. They might also have non-school related activities going on that they are signed up for. For example: dance, gymnastics, or cotillion classes. People might also have family things going on. That could mean having to get a part time, after school job to help their family, babysitting younger siblings, and/or just helping out around the house a lot. There are lots of reasons someone wouldn't have enough time to participate in an extracurricular activity.

People value their free time and might not enjoy having to do an extracurricular activity. When you are an adult you will most likely have to go to work most of the time. That means you won't be able to have that much free time and you should cherish the free time that you do have and a lot of people know that and do cherish it, but not always by participating in extracurricular activities. People also don't always enjoy doing extracurricular activities. They might prefer to do chores, sit around on electronics, or do service projects during their free time. People also like to have free time so that they are able to be free to hang out with their friends. If you are busy with an extracurricular activity then your friends might want to hang out and you won't be available even if you haven't hung out in a while. Like I said before, a lot of people value their free time a lot and don't always enjoy extracurricular activities.

I am aware that people can be social. They like to talk to and be with people a lot. However, not everyone is social. They can be introverted and not like being around or talking to other people. Forcing them to do something social, such as participating in an extracurricular activity will do nothing but make them want to leave. People are anti-social and requiring them to be social by participating in an extracurricular activity won't do anything for them.

Extracurricular activities should not be required for school. Extracurricular activities should not be required because not everyone has the time, people like having free time and might not enjoy extracurricular activities, and people can be introverted and extracurricular activities would force them to be social like an extrovert or ambivert.
