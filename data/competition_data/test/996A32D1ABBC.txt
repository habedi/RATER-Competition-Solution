How do you feel about students summer being teacher designed or student designed? I agree that student projects should be designed by themselves. Students will be able to have there own creative project rather than, having the same thing as there friends. Students wouldn't think that other people are cheating from there projects.

In my opinion, I agree that students summer projects should be student designed.

Firstly, Students summer projects should be based on students designed because of the creativity of students.

In this generation students have a lot of creative ideas and that It can be use in there classwork. Students doing projects that are student designed will give students to think about what they will do instead of being outside and doing the wrong thing. For example, Generic_Name has a project that he has to do over the summer but, his teacher says that It has to be In her order and that it has to be plain. When Generic_Name gets home he decided to go outside with his friends. since Generic_Name cannot be creative on his project he will not start on It.

Next, I think students wouldn't protect there project from other students anymore If they have to do there own creative project. It Is more than 45% of students cheat In the U.S today, students will have more trust in their peers around them If they be able to use their creative mind. For instance, Generic_Name and Generic_Name are doing there projects but Generic_Name walks out to use the bathroom, Generic_Name meanwhile gets up and take pictures of Generic_Name project because, he forgot how there teacher told them how to do It. Since Generic_Name forgot how to do the project he had to cheat.

Furthermore, I agree that students summer projects should be students designed but, If the project the teacher gives out Is by there designed It can help In many different ways. Teachers will be able to have lesser work while checking these projects If they are by there own designed. Teachers will be able to grade In a short amount of time because If the student follows the directions, the teacher wouldn't have to be frustrated on the grade.

Finally, students should be able to designed there projects rather than having your teacher deciding what to do.
