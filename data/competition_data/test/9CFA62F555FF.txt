Dear Principal,

I believe letting students have their cell phones in school and being able to use them in their lunch periods and other free times as long as there off during class is a very good idea.

You would have less detentions being handed out to students because of them having there cell phones out in class and texting on them. You would have more students wanting to learn instead of being mad all the time because they get so many detentions over having their phone out in class and/or because a teacher took their phone for them having it out in class.

I know if I were to get my call phone taken away for having it out in class I would be mad! I would just want to be angry all the time and I would end up having a major attitude towards the teacher that took my phone and gave me the detention and I would just end up with more detentions. I also know, if this were to happen to one of my friends they would act the same way. To us teenagers, our phone is our life! We don't leave home with out it, we don't do anything without it. So if more students could even just bring it to school and have it off it would give them... Us, a sense of comfort. Another thing, a lot of students wouldn't be so jumpy. They would be more comfortable and calm.

Students would probably get better grades too because when they get their phone taken and put in with the principal or in the desk of the teacher that took it, the student worries about it. So if they could not get it taken away they would be more willing to do their homework instead of worry.

So in my opinion, letting students have their phones in class and letting them use them in their lunch periods and free periods is a very wise idea. I believe this because kids would just be all around more happy. They'd be more comfortable, more willing to learn, less angry all the time and they would get better grades not having to worry about their phones at the school when they get taken away.
