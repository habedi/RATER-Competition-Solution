Dear Principal,

So you are trying to decide whether to require all students to perform community service? There are many reasons why and why not to perform community service at our school, but lets focus on the positives. Some students here at our school like community service and try their best at it and some... well, not so much. Nevertheless, I think we can take those who prefer not to do community service and show them the value and superiority of completing tasks of community service. All students would learn about helping others and making our community a better place to live in.

Our fellow students could be split up into groups and have a variety of things to choose from with their group. Such as planting flowers, plants, or gardens in dull and lifeless areas; going to a soup kitchen to help cook for the less fortunate and clean up afterwards; going to an elementary school and tutoring younger children to help get them caught up with their classmates. We could also go to elders homes an help them do things they are not capable of doing. Anyone and everyone would appreciate us.

Students should see the value of helping others. Not enough of us understand how much people appreciate and idolize those who are generous. Not very many people take the time to give a person or place in need a helping hand. Excuses like "I don't have time to do community service", or "I have better things to do than do community service" should no longer be valid. I hope you don't think you have wasted your time reading this letter. Hopefully you will have a bigger and better perspective on Community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
