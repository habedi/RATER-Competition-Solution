At the beginning Luke bomberger did not know when his life would change sooner or later when he got a little older. Luke had two part time jobs one of them was at the grocery store the second one was at the bank, then his friend Don Reist came and told Luke if he want to come with him in a adventure to go to the Europe on a cattle on a boat. So that is when he said to him self ''this could be the moment I had been waiting for in a long time''. They both needed supplies to have a life time. Finally the Seagoing Cowboys were hired by the UNRRA to take good care of the horse, young cows, and also the mules that all of them were shipped overseas. When he was 18 years old he thought it was a good idea to join the military service. He choose to go to the military service before he came to Greece. But he didn't choose to be in the military service. So they still traveled it took two weeks cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eats cost of united state and it also took about a month to get to China. So when are carrying the animals it is harder to travel. But for Luke was more than a adventure it opened up his world into seeing stuff. He said '' I am grateful for the opportunity that I had''.
