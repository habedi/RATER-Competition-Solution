dear principle, i believe that you should not say the students can not play sports if they do not have a B average or above. i believe that is unfair to them because what if they were absent and the teachers forgot to let them make it up. also the teachers could just not be explaining it well enough and does not help them even when they ask for the help. it would also anger students that cannot for their life get an B average. for this reason i believe it would have a negative affect on students if they had to have an B average or above to play sports because it keeps us fit, helps improve grades, and helps us socialize.

it helps us stay fit by us running or jumping and actually getting us off the couch. keeping us healthy and fit is a necessity because of obesity all around the world. we also need to be healthy to fight off diseases and sicknesses. we need to fight off these germs to stay in school and learn all we need to know to prepare for our lives as adults. this is why i believe we don't need an B average to play sports.

i say it helps improve students grades because of our parents saying they will pull us off our teams if our grades are not as well as they should be. so this would keep us studying and doing our home work. students love sports to much to where they would want to keep their grades up.

it might also help students concentrate because they would be ready to play. this is why i believe sports help with grades.

sports help children socialize by having them meet new people. this may help them because they could become studying partners. which may also help with grades. it may also help so would have friends and not be lonely. this will help so they would do their work so they can hang out with them. this is why i believe sports help socialize.

playing sport helps kids remain fit, improve grades, and socialize. it is important to keep the kids of America fit to fight illnesses. it helps improve grades by the pressure to do good so they continue to play. it is good for us to socialize so we stay out of trouble when we are playing. these are all the reasons i believe students don't need at least an B average to play the sports that we all love.
