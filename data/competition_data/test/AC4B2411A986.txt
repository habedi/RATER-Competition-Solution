Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to let you know that you should let your students bring phones to school. Some principals don't let their students bring phones to school at all. I think phones should be brought to school and should be used during lunch time or any other free time, not during class time. Many students get their phones taken away everyday for either texting in class, or using when they are not suppose to. Teachers use their phones at school also, so students should too. Honestly I bring my phone to school, but I only use during free time just like when you are suppose to use it. The only other time should be able to use their phone is if an emergency happens the teacher can't contact the office. Lunch time is a real good time to use their phone because it is a free time and class isn't taking place. Some students usually have to show their friends a picture, or a text, etc. The schools that don't let their students bring cell phones to school should. I think bringing cell phones to school is a great idea and lot other students think it is a good idea also. Now it is time for you to choose whether to let students bring cell phones to school or not.

Your Student,
