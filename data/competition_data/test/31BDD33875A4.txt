Dear principal,

I think students should be required to perform community service because it will help our community grow and prosper . We may not know it, but when we do thing's that harm our environment, it harms people and animals physically and emotionally, and we need those thing's to survive.

For example, we get things from our environments such as animals to eat, water to drink, air from plants to breath, and wood to build things. So if the people who work in the factories cant breath, how are they going to package the meat, vegetables, fruit, and grains that we need to survive? If the animals cant drink water due to it being polluted, how are we going to get those animals to eat?

What about education? Humans aren't born with the ability to talk, write, or read. We need to learn these things step by step. Education is one of the things that u will need especially to live out in the free world when you become an adult. People nowadays want all of these fancy new cars, and the big house, and the cute girl. Well question is how are you going to get the cute girl, or the big fancy house, and the nice cars without any education? Girls don't want a person who isn't smart. Big houses and fancy cars cost money. Without education who's going to hire you? McDonald's? That's where you are going to end up if your education isn't right. Without community service the economy's going to go downhill for the worse.

Sincerely,
