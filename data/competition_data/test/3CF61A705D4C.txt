Dear principle, i write this letter to you to try to persuade you to let us students, use our phones during lunch and brunch, and other free time.

I believe we should be able to use our phones for various reasons. Some like, we would be able to communicate with our parents when we are at school, we would be able to communicate with our friends, and we would like to come to school more because we can use our phones. Students will be happy to hear that we can text or call during school.

Their are many reasons why I want to persuade you to let us use our phones during school. One reason is, we would be able to communicate with our parents. Sometimes our parents have to tell us something and they call us but we can answer because we are at school. Other times our parents tell us we have to walk home and then again, they cant because we are at school.

Therefore we should be allowed to use our phones during school.

Second many students like to communicate and keep in touch with their friends. We like to text our friends 24/7 but yet we cant because we are at school and we have to turn our phones off. We should be allowed to have our phones and use them to talk to our friend. Even sometimes when your school is big and you can find your friend you should be allowed to call(text) them to find them. to conclude we should be able to have our phones off.

The last reason i will state, is we should be allowed to have our phones on at school because, we would like to come to school, because at our age our phone is our best friend and if we don't have it we wouldn't like to come. We like to have our phone to communicate. We would be interested in school knowing we can use our phones.

To conclude, we should be allowed to have our phones on during lunch and brunch, free time. We should have them on because we can communicate with our friends, we can communicate with our parents, and we would want to come to school. Therefore I hope you can go with the policy to let us have our phone on during brunch, lunch and free time.
