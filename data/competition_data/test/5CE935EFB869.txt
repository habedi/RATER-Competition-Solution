Imagine you are in a classroom at school. You're listening to the morning announcements and near the end of the announcements you hear your principal say, "From this point on, all students are required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity." This is most likely thing in some schools already but if this were to happen at my school, I would disagree with this very much. I would disagree with this new rule because students have lives outside of school and some students would not do anything.

First of all, students have lives outside of school. When students get home, they have things to do, these things often include homework. Extracurricular activities consume valuable time that students need to complete all kinds of homework like, essays and projects or even just some simple paperwork. When students are short on time because of these activities and can't complete homework or projects on time, they get very stressed out. When theyÂ don't finish in time then have to turn in incomplete work, it could significantly lower their grade in that class. This happens more than you may think. For example, I used to play soccer after school and practice would normally end around 8:30 pm, so it was pretty late. Due to the fact that it was late and I still had things that I needed to finish for school, it added to the stress that i was already dealing with.

Finally, Some students just wouldn't do anything. Just because the principal said that students have to take part in least one extracurricular activity, doesn't mean that the students who didn't want to join in the first place will do anything to contribute to whatever activity they decided to do. When a student doesn't want to do something, most of the time they just decide not to do it, especially if it doesn't affect any of their grades. This is most likely what a majority of students would do if this rule was implemented. I know that this is what would happen because when I was at private school, they made us participate in after school activities. Those that didn't want to do anything, including me, didnt do anything.

In conclusion, I would disagree with this rule if it was put into place because Students have things to do outside of school, and the students that don't want to do anything, won't do anything. I think this idea would just be a huge waste of time and i'm glad that it is not a thing in my school.
