Dear principal ,

I think that students should be able to play and participate in a sport and activities ,but students must have at least a letter grade of a C or a B . The reason why I think this is because students should focus more on their grades and how they do in school then focusing on sports and other activities . At The same time I think that students should be allowed to play and participate in any sports and activities they want even if they have some bad grades because it looks good in college applications when students sign up for the college of their dreams . You should really think about what you decide to do and think it through , it's not only about what you want to do , but it's also about what students want and need and those students want to play sports and participate in other activities . What ever choice you make , should feel like it's a good choice ,both for you and the students of our school . Also , think about what will be the reaction of those students that play in a sport and wouldn't be able to play if you take away their privileges if you don't let them participate because of the lack of good grades .

Think about the right thing to do .

Your Student ,
