Generic_schools have students completing summer project to assure they keep learning. Some bealive that it should be teacher designed because it's done the format teachers want, have students working on the same topic, and can help a student get interested in a topic. However, I bealive it should be student designed because students can do research on topics they enjoy, they don't like the teachers topic, and can be more creative. That is why it should be student-designed.

First, students like to do research on topics they have interest in. As a student I do better on projects where I do my own research on. Back in middle school I did a project of the wildlife in Virginia and, I felt that I could complete the project on time. Doing the project on wildlife in Virginia had me doing all types of research from online to reading books to get my information. I learned that the wildlife in Virginia is one of the most mind blowing places on the map of the United States.

Second, students are not interested on the topic teachers assign to them. Students will lack on the project and not give their best effort. Their was a survey conducted at a school asking students if they prefer their own topic or teachers topic. Seventy percent of students answered they prefer their own topic and thirty percent prefer the teachers topic. The seventy percent of students explained that it gives them a opportunity to do a project they like. Most students spend the entire school year doing projects on topics they're assign to. During the summer they should do a project on a topic of their interest.

The last reason is students can be more creative with projects. Most teachers want the students to complete the project in a certain way. With summer being two-three months long students can find other ways to do the project. Example would be a student can do his/her project on a power point instead of writing on it paper. another way that would be creative is do a video on your research. Students exploring ways to do their project can help them on the real world of working.

In conclusion the project should be student-designed for students to get the opportunity to be creative, do topics they enjoy, and not worry do the teachers topic. Students have all summer to complete the project on their own design. That is why the project should be student-designed.
