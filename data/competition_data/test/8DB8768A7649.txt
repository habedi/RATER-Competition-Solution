Do you believe schools should make students do at least one extracurricular activity? Because, I think you should be able to choose if you want to. Some people believe you should make students do this stuff, but it just doesn't seem right to me. Some people physically can't make it to things like this. Making students do an extracurricular activity could cause less family time, or distraction to life and school, or even make them upset because they can't find an activity that fits them.

First, some kids already have limited family time. They wake up and go to school for about 7 hours, then they come home and do their home work, and that right there is a lot of hours taken away which means only a few hours is left for family. A lot of kids want more family time and making them do stuff like this would just make it worse. Some parents even make their kids do things like chores. If they have a activity they have to do then they would have to do chores on the weekend when they are free and actually are with their family.

Secondly, if students have to do an activity, it could end up distracting them from doing their work. Some might end up liking it so much to the point where it takes all their time away from studying and homework. But others, could end up disliking it so much that they stress about having to do it to the point where it's such a big distraction they can't focus because they are anxious about even going. So it could go either way and end up bad for the students.

Lastly, some students get so upset that they can't find something they enjoy. Sports and these types of clubs aren't for everyone. When trying to find an activity, it can be hard for students. If they can't find something they like, they tend to get very anxious and upset. They don't have activities for every type of person at school, and that's why some students just don't fit in with clubs.

Therefore, I suggest that no one should make students do extra activities like that if they don't want to, it's not for everyone and that's okay. If a student really wanted to do an activity like that, then they would. I believe suggesting activities like this to students would be very nice, but don't control them. What do you believe? Should students have to do an extracurricular activity?
