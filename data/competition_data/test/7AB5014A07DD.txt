Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know your considering to change the school policy to make it so you have to have a "b average", and above to participate in sports. It may seem like a good idea to you but no one agrees. Kids need an extra curricular activity to do after school. You should not make it so kids are limited in school activities.

Most students try really hard in school to get good grades and to focus on their work. Most of them want a relief to get there mind off things ,and just take a brake of there every day routine. Are students need to be able to play sports and join clubs with out keeping that "b average" you want. Society says its a good thing to be involved and active. It keeps kids away from drugs and laziness. For example 67% of students who get active in sports or a club are more successful in life and get better grades. Those are the kids who are going to try in life and do the right thing.

The students of our school are the future of America. They are the things that will control our country and every thing else here. If you keep them stuck on school and just school things will go wrong. Kids will have nothing to relief stress, there going to go to drugs or a gang. All the wrong things you parents try to keep us out of. If you are concerned about or safety then let us be in a club with out a grade average.

We can make a compromise, if you are turning in all your work and have 65 or above you can be in any after school activity. Also you could make it so a teacher has to recommend you for an after school activity. Still don't but that limit on us kids if you want us to have good lives , let us live it.

Sincerely , STUDENT_NAME
