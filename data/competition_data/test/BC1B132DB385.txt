Some schools have started to require students to complete projects over the summer to show that they are still learning even during their break. If students have a project to complete during their summer break do they get to design what the project is or do the teachers do that? Having students design the project may be beneficial in getting them to be interested in it. On the other hand, if teachers design the project then it may be helpful for lessons during the school year.

Having the students design their own summer project gives them more freedom to create and find things that interest them. For example, in English we were able to write a story about anything we saw fit. This got me to think outside of the box and create something that I am very proud of. Giving students the freedom to create their own projects also effects in their diversity an personality show making it unique.

Some people may think that it would be better if the teachers designed the summer projects. Their reason being is that if teachers plan the project, they could use it as a refrence for lessons later in the school year. However, most students have a hard time with receiving a "template" form of a project.

Lastly, if your school has started to require summer projects and you think that they should be student driven, talk to your school administrator or counselor. Explainning why you think students should design their projects may get them to see ypur point of veiw on this topic.
