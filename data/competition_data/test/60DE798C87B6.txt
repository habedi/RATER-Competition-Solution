Phones and driving

Generation X is constantly caught having used a cellphone while operating a vehicle. The cell phone is a "life saver" and helps individuals with everyday tasks. However, while driving to a destination is the use of a cell phone prohibited? And if not, to what extent is it ok to use a mobile on the road?

The use of cellphones on the road is legal with certain restrictions in which not followed could result in a justified prosecution. Driving with a cellular device under the age of 18 while driving is strictly prohibited. Driving is a more taxing experience than most realize. It is a death sentence if not taken seriously. Nearly 1.6 million crashes happen annually to texting and driving. This is due to the driver taking his/her attention of the road and not being aware of their surroundings. There should be not lenience when it comes to texting and driving and should be promoted not be a social norm.

Texting and driving is not a smart way to drive. There are too many variables as to what the outcome could turn out to be. Many people lose their lives to such things. Is that one text really worth someone's life?
