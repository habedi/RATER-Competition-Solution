Dear TEACHER_NAME, my name is STUDENT_NAME

not all student show be required o do community service. First of all is because some student don't have time to do community service. Second of all community service is a personnel choice you don't have to do it unless you get in trouble with the law and they make you do it. Third of all why would you even make student do community service if they don't want to ?

Some student cant even do community's service because they don't have the time. Some student play sports out side of school. Some kids have family problems at home and have to resolve those and don't have time for community service. There are also student that have homework or that are studying or getting extra help from a tutor because they don't get a certain subject.

Student also have a choice to do community service you cant force a student to do work. The only way you can do that is if they get in trouble at school or with the law. And if you were to force students to do community service a lot of student would leave your school and go to another where they can just learn and be with friends and not do community service. Now there will be some student that will volunteer because maybe they have extra time on there hands and are bored and figure why no help out but you can not force anybody to do community service.

I also have a question, why would you try to make students do community service? There already at school 5 days out of the week and do homework everyday and a lot of student play sports. So not a lot of student would have time to do this. that is why you should not make student do community service it should be a personal choice.
