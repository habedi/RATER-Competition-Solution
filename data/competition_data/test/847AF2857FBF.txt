Dear Principal,

Hello, I am a student in your school and would like to help you with the tough decision that has been forced upon you.

I agree that cell phones ruin learning in class, and yet help if we are in trouble or need counseling from a friend out of reach.

I would truly desire you to choose the first policy.

Guiding the students into a room without cell phones to be used as a distraction increases learning by large amounts.

You see, I have found that cell phones can truly help us kids to talk to friends we miss, or get help from far distances.

And yet, during a class, cell phones would be too much of a distraction in an environment of learning.

Now, banning cell phones completely might be a good choice, as for some people might not listen to this simple rule. And yet if the punishment is severe enough (like taking it away) they usually won't do it anymore.

I understand that I am just a kid and am not that experienced in this world that you and other adults have already passed through, and yet even the best of decisions can come from thirteen and fourteen year olds, right?

In the end, it all breaks down to this; we'll do it if you help us too. You see, us students may be blind to many things, but if shown the way, can see many problems or hidden outcomes even you grownups might have not seen.

All you need to do is help us take off the blindfold.

You don't know how much of an impression you have on us, and yet if you simply observe us intently, you will find us eventually learning the principles you want to teach us, and take them to heart.

In fact, we might even find ways to make all of your rules and ideas even better!

I thank you greatly for the help your choices will give us in our lives and simply ask of you to constantly try to show us the way through your behaviors and actions of kindness and cleanliness.

Your choices and actions are our guide, please never forget that.
