Is a teacher designed summer project better than one that is student designed? As a student I've had plenty of summer projects, but they were always due within 2 months of school starting. Although some may say it would be for a student to make their own summer project , personally I think a project made by a teacher isn't a horrible idea. Teachers should design these assignments because, some student would try their best to do the bare minimum or their project would make absolutely no sense. The main idea of a summer project is to keep your mind active in those months of little to no brain activity. In the 9th grade i had a summer project for my AP world History class i was going to take the following school year, the project was designed by my teacher, it was a lot, but it prepared me for my AP class that next school year. Now I know that it could be easier on the students and the teacher, if a student were to make their own project, and it would teach students independence, along with learning how to manage your time wisely, and a teacher could spend more time working on the curriculum they have to teach. Teachers have always designed summer project, but maybe one day the students will get the opportunity to create their own project, however, it would be in it's best interest if teachers created a list of things they could and couldn't do for their project. Although I think teachers know the best way to create a project that is fit to prepare a student.Â
