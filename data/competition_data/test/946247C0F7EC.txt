How fun would it be to go on a sea adventure and get paid? Because if you were a Seagoing Cowboy that's exactly what you would get to do. All that you would have to do if you were a Seagoing Cowboy is take care of some horses and cattle until you got where you were needing to be. That sounds fun and easy to me don't you think? And if somethings fun and easy, and you get paid for it why not try it out? So I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

One reason that you should join is because you could see some amazing sights as well as visit different countries, such as China, Italy, and Europe. Some sights that you may see would be the Elfell Tower, or roads made out of water, but only if you join.

Another reason is that after you dropped the animals off you could do some activities on the way back, like fencing, baseball, volleyball, whittling, and table tennis tournaments. That sounds like more than fun time by my standards.

I know some may say that they wouldn't do it because of sea sickness or others might say that it would be too dangerous because of bad wheather, but you can overcome sea sickness and the boats you're going to be on are made to withstand bad wheather. Plus I'm pretty sure that if the wheather's going to be bad we're not going to be sent out in it with the risk of losing cattle or horses.

Wow, all these things sure do want to make me hop aboard. I mean, easy money, sight seeing, fun activities it's basically a vacation you're being paid to go on! So find your sea legs lads and come aboard for a fun time.
