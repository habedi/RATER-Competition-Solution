Studdies have shown that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States alone. Many people see this as and eye opener to life in the suburbs without motor vehicles. There have been actions on car deduced communities in Europe. Also France baned Driving do to smog. Sounds Extream, but it is very effective.

There have been some countries that have reduced the usage of cars to almost nothing. In Vauban, Germany Residents of this community have given up their cars. This may seem a bit insane, but the way the government did it is varry smart. Street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. Their streets are completely "

Car-Free

". The government made it that if you still wanted a car you would have to pay an aditional $40,000 for a spot when buying your home. The result is 70 percent of Vauban's Families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. In the United States, the EPA (

Environmental Protection Agency

) is promoting "

car reduced

" communities. Legislators are starting to act as well. Bogota has a car-free day where the only motor vehicles running are busses and taxis.

Some countries are even going to harsh measures by banning motor vehicles all togather. In France they had so much smog that they baned driveing all togather. France desided that they where going to order even-numbered license plates owners to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Same for odd-numbered cars the following day. almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 had their cars impounded because of their reaction to the fine. But congestion was down 60 percent in the capital. In Bogota, Colombia they have had three straight years where cars have been banned with only buses and tavis permitted in a capital of 7 million. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.

They have goten people to partisipate in their community. Also They have gotten other countries to get involved in this cause. Diffrent countries have Made their own style of these programs to their advantage. This idea of car-free suburbs is changing the way the population reacts in the community.       Â
