To Whom It May Concern:

If someone wants to do community service they can , but if someone else doesn't want to help with the community and would rather play a game or be lazy and watch T.V. most of the day they can. If a person wants to be helpful with the community they can be helpful by picking up trash, looking after kids when there parents aren't home also by helping people out like getting them groceries , and by cleaning up after an event or something that has happened ,all while taking out of that persons own time. The main point of this letter is to say that if a person wants to do community service they can but if they don't want to and think that its lame and other stuff and takes time away from there lives also with what they are trying to do no madder to consciousness.

Help children in the elementary they will be helping that child learn and be a productive thinker also make its life become better as for whatever means necessary . In the time being the elementary in our school is very well productive and have had some mishaps but all of those are in the past and now we are looking into the future which will make the child's life better and help there learning ability .

The way the children learn is by watching others do it so that they will figure out how to do it and the process will be very difficult if there is none there to help that child with what they need to learn and that when a child sees what they are suppose to do that will help them with there future and possibly another generation of people that will help the community.
