The statement that has been gooing around stating "the face on Mars was created by aliens." The statement is false, the face you have seen on mars is a natural landform. The photos you have seen was a hill developing in the process over time. We have taken a photo of the strange spot on the planet Mars and it has been reported,that it is a natural landform.

We did not have the same technology as what we have had in the past. When we first took the picture we did not have the same technology so we had a blurry picture. But when we have our technology now, we have better cameras so that we can get a better image of the big red planet called Mars. We have no proof that aliens have built this face in the surface on mars. This face you see on the planet is just a landform.

The face you might see in the photograph is just a mind illusion that you might see a face. the face you see is a hill that has been formed by the ways of the planet its self. It might have been molding from the dust and the wind dragging the red sand and dirt off of the hill its self.

We have no way or knowledge to know that aliens have built this face on the hill. The face has been forming for probably thousands and thousands of years. We think the forming on mars, like craters and hole in the ground, plus the face is just a natural landform forming on the crust of mars its self. How would we know if other forms of life built this face?...We dont know because we do not have that much knowledge about the space. There are infifnity of space out their that we have not explored yet so how would we know if the aliens have built this.

The thought of this statement that aliens have built this face in the crust of mars is ludicris. The face on mars has been formed by natural landformings in the crust of Mars. The theory of aliens made the face is as dumb as a bump on a log.
