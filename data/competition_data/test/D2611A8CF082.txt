I believe that policy 2 would be the best choice for a few reasons. Cell phones are very distracting to students even when they are not in the classroom.

When you are at lunch or brake from school, phones are not needed because they could be used as a tool to bully other students when they are in the area. If someone doesn't want to talk to the other person when they are in the area, phones may make the other person do what they want which leads to bad things happening. Also, they are distracting to the teachers that are monitoring the lunch because the student is constantly looking down at the phone and pressing buttons. This could mean that they are cheating on homework, or just messing around. This is not good because the teachers need the school to be safe, and phones are very distracting to other students. Some students don't want to look over and notice their friend is laughing about something on their phone.

You don't need phones in school because there are other ways to contact your parents if there is an emergency. You would use the phones in the main office and if that isn't working, then use your teacher's phone. There are also tools on the cell phones like calculators, and other things. You don't need this in the classroom because the teacher could suspect that you are cheating or doing something else. When there is an event where you have to take a picture, the teacher should allow the students to bring in a disposable camera, not a cell phone. Cell phones may be traded around the room, and the students could lose their phone.
