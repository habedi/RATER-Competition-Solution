Dear principal,

I do not think that students should have to community service because students might not have time to do all their home work. They might not have enough time to be able to any thing they want to do. They might not have time to go out and eat with their families. if family is coming over that they have not seen in a long time they will not be able to see them. this would not be fair to some families that live really fare away from each other. this could get in the way of sports and after school activities. This might make people have to quit some after school activities. this would be hard on the students because they would have to stay up late to finish their home work. this would mean that more students would show up to school late. This would also make a lot of students fall behind in their school work because they would be to tired to do some of it.

This would not be fair because students would nit be able to do anything that they want to do. they wouldn't be able to do these things because they would have to do Community service and then when they got home they would have to do home work. the students would not be able to go out side and have fun with their friends. i think that they should not have community service as a normal thing. i think that if the students do something bad that that student should have to do it for like a week or two depending on what they did.

sincerely, students
