A reason that people should participate in the seagoing cowboy program is because it is fun. I know this because the text says " Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded." Also, because the text says " The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed."

Another reason to join in the seagoing cowboys program is because you get to help and take care of animals. I know this because the text says " UNRRA hired "seagoing cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."

People should also join the seagoing cowboys program because they get to travel to places like europe and china. I know this because the text says " Besides helping people, i had the side benefit of seeing europe and china." Also, because the text says " Luke also toured an excavated castle in crete and marveled at panama canal on his way to china."

Another reason people should join the program is because there is so much adventure and you get to do so many things. I know this because the text says " I'm grateful for all of the opportunity." Also, because the text says " So was taking a gondola ride in venice, italy, a city with streets of water."

In conclusion, people should join the seagoing cowboy program because it is fun, you get to help animals, you get to see differant places and travel, and you get to participate in fun adventures like going to china.
