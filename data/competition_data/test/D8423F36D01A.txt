Dear Principal at SCHOOL_NAME ,

I think that policy one is a great idea. Having cell phones will make school great for students. We the students should have a great time at school but learn at the same time so i do think we can have phones at lunch and free time, because during class we need our learning time sure but not during class we can have our own time. Having cell phones will make it fun but only during those to times. When we our done with our phone we will make sure that we turn it off, and if somebody cell phone is not off they have the right to get it taken by a teacher or principal .

Cell phones will make school exciting for students, we can learn and have fun at the same time. I honestly think that you can trust us with this idea, we will not let you down. If you give us this chance to have the right to have our cell phone out at anytime besides learning period than that will be great. We need learning and we also need fun so please give us a chance with this decision. Thank you for giving us this opportunity to try something new and i hope we can get the decision we are looking for.

With us having our phones during free time that mean we can come back to learning time prepared just cause we had some time to ourselves. When it come to cell phones us the students are up for anything and we would love this opportunity to have cell phones out but not during learning time. So i speak for all students when i say please can we have this opportunity, it will make school so much better for all. Teacher's don't have to worry about kids acting a fool because they already had there fun and student's don't have to worry because they can text and talk later. So principal at SCHOOL_NAME

can you please grant our wish.

Sincerely , STUDENT_NAME
