Dear Central Office:

I understand that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. The first cell phone policy I think personally is the way to go. Most kids crave social time and that's when they would get it, during lunch and other free times. You are probably thinking that most kids already get social time during lunch and free times, I disagree. Lunch is only twenty to thirty minutes long and it's not with all of our friends. Some may have a different lunch time or free time than others. If you did change the phone policy to the first one you are considering than anyone can talk to their friends that have a different lunch time or free time. Most kids would get all of their own talking and energy out to where they wouldn't have to say much during classes so that they could pay attention more, and make better grades. If this were to happen I hope that you will keep the phone policy that way for a long time to come. I thank you for taking the time to read this letter and I hope you will really consider the first policy.

Sincerely,
