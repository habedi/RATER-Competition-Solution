The principal wants to make everyone join in an extracurricular activity and i don't agree. I thank that the students should chose if they want to join or not join a extracurricular activity. If they dont want to that's up to them. If they did not wont to join then the students might not do anything in the activity expressly if they are doing it agents there own will. I know i would if i was forced agents my will.

If you did not want to do something would you do it if you whir not asked or told to do it? Because if not why would you do it if you are told to? If you hate football would you play it? I know i would not.

Like i said before the students should be able to chose if they want to join or not. If they do want to join then good for them, but if they dont then leave them alone. Some of them might not have the time or the transportation. Some of them might focus on their grades instead of games, and the student needs to have good grades so it would be a waste of time for some of them.

Maybe they just like any sport, or they dont like to art. Maybe they dont want to be on the student council because they thank it's to much responsibility. Maybe they don't know how to use a camera for the year book. Maybe they find know interest in any extracurricular activity.

so i dont agree to what the principal thanks. So that is what i thank. So the students might not have the time and they might not be intested in any extracurricular activity. I am going to ask but do you agree with me?
