It's the end of the school year and kids and teachers are excited to leave for summer break, but what comes with that break for most schools is a dreadful summer project. Some schools decide that their students have to complete a project during the summer to make sure they are still learning even though they are not in school. People can't decide if the projects should be teacher or student designed projects. I think they should be student designed in order for the students to get the most out of the learning.

If students think of the blueprint of their project then they will be better able to understand it. Having students make their own project challenges them to know how to find their own information. They are forced to learn about a whole topic by doing their own research and completing it on their own. All the teachers have to do is give them a certain criteria to make sure they are all learning the correct information that they need to complete the projects. It is more beneficial for the students to get their information first hand to get the most out of learning.

Some people think that the projects should be teacher designed. They think that if the students have the control that they either won't get it done or won't get it done correctly. The project won't get done efficiently and it would've been a waste of time for them to do it anyways. Having the teachers give them the information will assure that the students get what they need to better understand the subject. When the teacher designs the layout of the project it is easier for them to show the students how it should be done correctly.

When doing their summer project, students still are using their brain so they can continue to be used to the learning atmosphere. Students are still getting work done during the break without getting lazy. When kids have a long break from school it is hard for them to get back in the dynamic of going back to school. They get so used to having that break that their brains aren't ready to start doing work again. By having them learn and create their own summer project their brains will still be somewhat used to learning for when school comes back in session.

Having students get more into their learning benefits them in so many ways. Summer projects are a great way for students to keep learning, especially if they themselves design how they think it should be. They get the chance to get ahead in their school learning for the upcoming school year by doing everything themselves. Having students that can teach themselves benefits them while they can still learn from others.Â
