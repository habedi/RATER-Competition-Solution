Dear Principal:

My name is STUDENT_NAME.

I am writing on the subject of whether we should require all students to perform community service. I personally think that community service is very important. Students should be required to do community service for many reasons. Many students would be getting into trouble if it weren't for community service. Community service teaches people, especially students, responsibility.

In high school, community service hours count towards credits for college, many schools even have clubs for community service. If you put you mind and give all your effort towards it, community service can actually be very fun. If the school planned days to do different community service activities together many students wouldn't think of it as a burden. Doing anything with you friends can make the most boring of situations actually quite entertaining. Also, if there was some reward given at the end of the year for most community service hours many students would take part in the community service.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this. I hope you found what I had to say useful, and might consider all that I have said.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
