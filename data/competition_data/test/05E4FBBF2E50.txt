Dear, Principal

I understand clearly that you have to have good grades to join an activity in school. Well most students have a c average. Well to be honest i think that you should let them participate in these events first of all i think you should because that is one way they could get active and healthy second of all just make a deal with the student. Tell the student i will let you participate in these events if you start bringing your grades up or something. so if you do ass i say it will do good for both things they will bring there grades up and be in shape and healthy. Also if you do the student will start listening and participate in school so it will do good for the student and once they listen they'll start doing good on there test scores it will also make the school look good so it makes good for you and the student. :D
