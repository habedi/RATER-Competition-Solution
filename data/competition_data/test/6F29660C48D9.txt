Your school has just decided to change up the rules a little, now you're required to take an extracurricular activity. You could do anything from sports to student council! Do you think this is fair? When you think about the facts it seems like a good idea. It will encourage students to be more active and participate in sports. It could even bring the students out into the real world and off their phones, and it could really benefit their overall health. In extracurricular activities you usually have to work with other people or collaborate, so they'll even improve the students team building and social skills. I fully support the new change to the school system, I believe many students could be benefited by this change.

Do you play a sport? how'd you find that sport? Many students play a sport that the schools has, for example lacrosse, basketball and football. When you're looking for a new sport it helps when you have friends willing to join with you. Schools have a wide range of sports and it's pretty easy to find one your interested in, and you can join with a couple friends! By joining a sport you could be getting a lot more exercise and spend more time outside you just need a little nudge to start. The schools new rule is that little nudge that you and many of your classmates need.

Many students own cell phones and spend wayyy too much time on them, you could spend hours on your phone and not even notice! The average screen time amount for teens (12-18) is around 6 hours every day. Dont you think its time for a change? It's proven that phone use is one of the leading causes of depressed and anxiety. It's important to live a life outside of your phone. Students who have an extracurricular activity are proven to spend less time on their phones, studies show that by spending more time out in the real world it greatly improves your health and mood. Teens can get really lazy and just sit around on their phones all day. It gets hard to make them do anything else. The extracurricular rule will make it so that they're required to get off their phones out out into the real world!

Do you enjoy making friends and being a part of a group? It's important to have good social skills and practice talking to others. Sometimes it can be really hard to get out there and make friends. Taking an extracurricular activity can really improve your social skills and your team building skills. If you decide to join a sport you can practice a lot of team building and improve your leadership. If sports just are'nt your thing you can try student council, or other fun group building activities! If you're more of an introvert you could try library club or art club! In the activities you're bound to meet a lot of great, caring people who can really help open you up. If you're looking to make friends extracurricular activities are an amazing way to meet new people.

Students really need some encouragement to start doing more activities outside of school. The benefits are never ending and can make you a whole new person! There are thousands of extracurricular options to pick from. students can learn, make friends, improve their health and spend less time on their phones.

It's proven that doing something you love raises your grades because your more confident in yourself, but you wont find something you love without looking. The new rule is just a little head start. Extracuricular activities are the way to go!
