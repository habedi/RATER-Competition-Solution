The face on Mars is just a natural formation. It wasn't built by any aliens. Natural formations like the face are commonly seen in that area of Mars. The formation does not completely resemble a face; there are many flaws. NASA would tell the public if they had any solid evidence that suggests it was built by aliens.

Rock formations like the face are common in that area of mars and it is very possible that they could look like a face. There are a lot of rock formations on Mars. Out of all those formations, one of them is probably going to resemble a face.

The rock formation doesn't resemble a face perfectly. There are flaws that suggests it is just a natural formation. If it was an alien built formation, there would be a lot less flaws. They wouldn't waste all that time making it and leave so many flaws.

NASA would definetely tell the public if there was any sign that an alien civilazation built it. NASA would have to tell us that they discovered a civilazation. They get their money from us. NASA would get a lot of funding to explore the face if there was any sign of any civilazation and that is what NASA is all about, exploring.

The face is just a natural formation. No aliens built the face. There are many of these types of rock formations in that area. The formation has a lot of flaws that don't resemble a face. NASA would tell the public if it was built by aliens.
