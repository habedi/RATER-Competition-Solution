Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. In my opinion, the summer projects that assure students continue learning over thier breaks. Should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. Even though, if the projects were teacher-designed students wouldn't have to come up with the project. I disagree with teacher-designed projects because, students may not complete the assignment, or forget about the project.

One supporting reason, for student-designed projects is that students will get to come up with their own project. Students will feel more determined, and motivated to do the projects. Students would get the chance to widen their knowlodge, and learn things they want to learn about, or aren't taught in school. Important things that aren't taught in school for example: politics, religons, traditions, and some languages. Therefore, students will get to expand there brains, and have a good time learning.

Second, students may not have the supplies at home to complete the projects that the teachers may assign. Students may be poor or just low on money, which is another very good reason to have student-designed projects. Students also would have no reason for the projects to not be completed if there student-designed. The students would have no reasons to have exuses like; it was hard, or they didn't uderstand,or thy were bored, or they tried but it stressed them out.

Third, if they are teacher-designed projects students may get overwhelmed, or disagree with the teachers about the projects. Because; students are not in school, and they may not have anyone who can help them at school. ''In my experiences I have had time were my teachears have given me packets over summer break , and I struggled, or I didn't do it.'' Students grades shouldn't if they didn't know how to do the work, and thats another reason I do not support teacher-designed projects.

Finaly, my reasons for supporting that summer break projects should be student-designed are; students will feel more determined, and motivated to do the projects, students may not have the supplies at home to complete the projects that the teachers may assign, students may get overwhelmed, or disagree with the teachers about the projects.
