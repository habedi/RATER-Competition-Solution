Dear principal,

I think that phone should be allowed to come out during lunch or any free time that we have. One reason is because when we want to meet up with people like our friends when we cannot find theme all we have to do is get out our phones and call theme. And if you let us have our phone out during our free time then you worry about us texting or using our phones during class because then our phones would be off. Also when people are trying to ask to get something that they forgot and another person is still in that spot they can call that person or text theme and ask if they can bring it for theme. For instance it could be homework that they left in class or maybe even things that belongs to theme are left in class and the person can then bring the item for theme. That's another reason why you need to get in touch with another person on your cell phones. And if you did not let us have our phones out at all then we wouldn't be able to have contact with anybody like to meet up with theme or to ask if they can kindly grab something for theme that they forgot and if they are in the same thing or item that they forgot. These are some reasons why we should be allowed to bring our phones out during school time. And some things that are happening now because we cannot bring out our phones.
