The Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. For example the author states ''A classroom computer could recognize when a studeny is becoming confused or bored,''Dr Huang predicts.''Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor''(Making Mona Lisan smile).

This new system is also really smart in detecting oneself emotions for example,the author also states that''But in a false smile,the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie;these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ''smiling''politician or celebrity isn't being truthful''(Making Mona lisa Smile).

This is important because this new technology system can help a lot with kids education.

Sometimes kids are afraid of asking their teachers for help because they feel embarrased but with this new technology system it will actually make students feel not afraid or embarrased.

Students are actually going to get help without having to ask a teacher because the Facial Action Coding System will be able to recognize if a student is confused or bored and then it's going to come in with help.

Also this new system can help teachers know how students are feeling towards a subject and how they are doing on a certain subject. The new system will make it easier for teachers and will also save them a huge time rather than asking or doing tests to show results on how well they know the lesson.

This matters because I personally think this new system will make a huge difference because I'm one of those kikds that feel afraid or embarred to ask a teacher for help.

This will help alot with students education by helping them with what they need help and by making them feel more secure.
