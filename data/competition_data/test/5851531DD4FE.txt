Summer break is a time we enjoy cause get to spend more time with friends and family. Some people think that taking a break won't do them harm at but you maybe allowing others to get ahead of you in life. The time you have on a break should be spent wisely not goofing around. During summer kids tend to study less which in return lowers brain activity which is why the should have a summer project to keep them busy. This summer project should be chosen by the students of the class room.

Teachers think students can't handle certain situation but who better to chose what the students can handle then them self for this project. When students are given the option to pick their project they will feel much more motivated to accomplish this assignment if they can choose what it is going to be about. This motivation will cause the students to work harder for their grade and strengthen the skills they already know or new ones need for this assignment. The students could come up with this summer project together so that everybody will feel equally involved want to do their best. The standard for the project should be high so be won't be able to show up with a barely worked on assignment and pass. This assignment or project should build on skills that have been used through out the class.

When kids have summer projects they could use it as a opportunity to build on skills need for a future career or maybe not so strong at like time management or mathematics. This extra time spent on the project will result in a positive change in grades and thinking. The brain is like a muscle the more you work it the stronger it gets so just like a muscle the less exercise you give it the more softer and weaker it is. There is more to just improving your work ethic and increasing brain productivity when it come to doing projects over the summer. When a kid is working on a project they are less likely to do something that can get them involved in dangerous or life threaten events.

When kids have less time to do things they will ultimately value their time more and start to make better decisions. This will lead to better planning in the future and time spent doing something productive. They will also start to think about how this summer project be able to help them in their future career options or college and branch out in try learning new skills to accomplish these task in life. When letting a teacher pick the summer project kids may not feel as motivated to do it or see it as stupid but, the teacher will strengthen their skills in that subject.

The project will lead to a better use of time over summer for most kids. This assignment will keep the kids working on their skills. This may even help kids see this project in a better view of why they have to do this. Their summers will be ten times more productive then they were before. Learning is a key foundation in life ,and the more you learn the more likely your chances of being successful.
