Landform or face? Is everyones first question when they hear about the figure that looks like a face that was found on Mars in 1976. NASA has studied this topic and has come to the conclusion that it is simply landforms. Now the question is what kind of land forms and how did they form?

NASA has been studying this topic since 1976 to 2001. Team Nasa has been reshearching and studying picturers and has come to the conclusion that the face is a landform. We are highly certain it is a butte or Messa .A butte or Mesa is a lava dome. We compared the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and it was the same hieght as the face on Mars. NASA has studied pictures that are so high tech that if there was small shacks on the planet you could see it! This reshearch has been fun for team NASA.

As part of the NASA team I can tell you we did thorogh research to be absolutly certain it was not created by aliens. If this were created by aliens it would be a big step for NASA and the world. I hope this information was helpful to you
