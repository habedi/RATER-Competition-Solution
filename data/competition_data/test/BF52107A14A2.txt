Dear, Senator

I think we should not keep the electoral college because we should have the right to choose who runs everything. We the people want to be free and vote on for what we want. Its not fair because the winner take all system in each state candidates they think they cant win.

Also if their is a tie the election will be thrown to the house of representitives. The senate would choose the vice president because each state gets one vote. That means the one representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters has as much say as 55 representatives from California with 35 million voters.

In the electoral college system voters vote for slate of electors not for presidents. They elect the president. It depends on the state who picks the electors. Voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.

Best argument against the electoral college is what people call the disaser factor. 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system allowed much worse consider legislatures picking electors and those electors could lways defy will of the people.

The people should be the ones picking the people they want in charge of the government. Thats why there should be no electoral college and let us vote and choose who we want.

Sincerly, The People
