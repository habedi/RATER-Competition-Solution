Dear principle,

I believe that the average grade to participate in a sport should be a C because it is not fair for students who depend on sports to have a good future. They shouldn't be denied that privilege because a C is still passing. Also because many students may not have the capability to maintain a higher grade, but can play a sport very well. Not all great sports legends started off by getting great grades. By not allowing them to take a sport you might be denying a child to have a future later on, as we all know many people play high school sports to get into college to become a professional. By not allowing them to play you are making it tough for them to move on in life and in education. you are making a clear statement to students all over the school that they aren't good enough to play any type of sport at all. To many children sports are always a way to take their minds off of tough decisions or private situations. Without that time to work with a team productively many children will not know how to communicate socially with other people. without the experience many children will lack the ability to communicate with others.
