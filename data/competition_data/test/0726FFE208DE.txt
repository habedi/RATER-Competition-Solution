Dear Principal,

Our school has recently been debating weather we should require all students to perform community service. I think that by requiring community service we would be helping not only the community but ourselves as well. We would be come more active, less selfish, and hopefully gain a better sense of moral. We also wouldn't just be helping ourselves but the people around us. They would feel better about where they live and who they live with/by. Making community service a school requirement would be a phenomenal idea.

Required community service would make the kids more active. Our free time is usually spent on some electronic lounging about. With community service we would be able to cut back on the gaming systems, movies, and over all laziness. We would be out cleaning the neighborhood, volunteering, and helping other people. We would become am

The kids in our school would by large become less selfish. We as children like to have everything we want and as we want. With community service we would be able to see how some people have so much less then we do. The word "want" would suddenly start to bring on a whole new meaning. Instead of saying " I want that toy mommy!", we would be able to say " Mommy I want those people living in that homeless shelter to have a home again." By being able to change the meaning of the word "want" we would have higher morals. We would think of someone else other than ourselves.

Requiring community service within our school would help promote the idea of selflessness. We would become a more active generation. We will have better and higher dreams for ourselves and our community. Our school should make community service a requirement.

Your student,
