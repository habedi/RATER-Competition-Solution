Sports.

My Personal opinion is that if a Student gets a D, Or Lower then they shouldn't be able to play for that grading period. Although, C' s are normal, or as some people say "Average" and average IS good. Some parents don't like C' s, but it's hard to get all A' s and B' s when you have sports to balance too, and I know people say school before sports but a C is good, so there's no problem, but I don't think you should make it higher, because that's just going to make us more stressed out, and make it twenty times worse. ! If you let your grade slip a little there's always the bus rides and times when your not playing to do your homework, So there's nothing to worry about, there's no reason really to change the grading scale for playing sports because it's just going to make it worse !. So I don't think you should change the grading scale, because being stressed can help do bad on Homework, and Tests. Some people can handle the stress, some people like it, and some people do terrible when there's stress put on them. So in a way, it'd just be making it worse , And that's the complete opposite of what you're trying to do in the first place right? No One really thinks of it like that. Hope I opened your eye's a little to help show that changing the grading scale would only make it worse.

Thanks, STUDENT_NAME.
