Principle,

I think students should do community service it will help are town and keep it clean.

A lot of kids think its a waste of time but really when you are all done you will be proud of your self. Nothing else its bad when you see someone drop there trash on the ground some people see other people do it and don't say anything. I pick up trash when i see it. When i go to the beach there's so much trash on the ground and know what i pick it up and throw it way.

There's no reason why you cant walk to a trash can and just throw it away. Its not that hard you know. It would be cool at are school at lunch if everybody threw there trash away and the teachers at are lunch wouldn't yell at us. Its so much easer to just do it first than doing it a second time when you first didn't throw it away and then the teacher is making you pick up 10 pieces of trash. There's kids at are school who get in trouble and there the ones that have to pick up the trash and roll a trash can with them and pick up trash the whole time at lunch. I think that's such a great idea.

I think everybody should do community service in Palm Desert. It will make are town so much cleaner and look so much better for people who come from other places and see are town they would be like wow look at this beautiful town. Because know what there wont be trash on the ground. I think people should go to the high way and pick up the trash because that's where everybody throws trash. People just throw it out there window like there personal trash can. People just don't care anymore. People are getting so lazy. I think people should start caring than not caring about earth. But back to the principle. I think the principal should require community service for the students.

Its super easy to pick up trash at your school so it would be super easy out side of school. don't you think? If people start caring the world would be a better place.
