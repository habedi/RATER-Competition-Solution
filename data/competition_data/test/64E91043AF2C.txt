Dear Principle,

I, along with most of my fellow students are against requiring us to do community service long or short. Many people already have a completely busy day and can barely finish what they're doing now in a 24 hour period. Community service is meant to be volunteer work if you have free time to help the community out. Not to be thrown on the Children in school.

Not only is the idea completely ridiculous, but we go to school for educational needs, not to clean up the town. There are kids that are failing classes in school because they don't have the time to study, or do homework, or just are flat out lazy. If some kids don't have the time to study or do homework where would they fit in the time for community service. Also, the lazy kids don't even want to be in school half the time so they most likely just wouldn't do the community service anyway.

We don't mind lending a helping hand when we can but for it to be forced upon us it'd be a nuisance. I know that even things I enjoy doing when I can, if people force me to do them i don't enjoy it as much if at all anymore. The students will volunteer when they can, and it should stay that way

We're hoping you see where many students and myself stand on this idea. It should NOT happen. We'll help as much as possible when we can but requiring us to help is not something any of us support. We do thank you for the concern on the town we live in but, this just should not be mandatory. We rest our case.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME & Many of Your Students
