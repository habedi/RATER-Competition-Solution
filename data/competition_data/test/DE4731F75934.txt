The positive things the author is saying about making driverless cars is more saftey because it got senses in it that can tell if you about to bag back into something it gives you a warning or if your going to fast it uses speed sensors to detect it and gives you a warning. If your brakes stop working while you driving it can detect it and use automatic break sensor to stop your car. The cars could handle the driving task on its own. It got a lot of sensors everywhere on the vehicle. It would have a video camera on the left rear wheel. A roatating sensor on the rood. Four automotive radar sensors. And it would have a GPS reciever. It will also have Dubbed LIDAR that have laser beams to form a constanly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. The negitive thing about having a driverless car is that it would take alot of upgrades and it would need smart-road systems. And the lawmakers says that the only safe way to keep drivers,passengers, and pedestrains safe is if the human driver is in control at all times. If the technology of the driverless car fails and someone is injured, they wouldnt know what to do because they wouldnt know who to blame. It could be the driver fault or the manufacturer. Some people wouldnt like a driverless car because they could get bored and tired of waiting for their turn to drive. And if any sensor breaks while the driverless car is going somebody could get hurt if any sensor is down. They don't got a back up sensor for none of the sensors. It's dangerous to have your hopes on sensors that can stop working anytime. Some people probably think if you got a driverless car what's the purpose of being behind the wheel?
