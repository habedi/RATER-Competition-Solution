Dear Principal,

I believe that students should not have to have a B average. I believe this because most students aren't as smart as others. But they try their best, and sometimes peoples best are only C averages. Which if you think about it, it isn't that bad at all. The students love sports and you shouldn't be able to take that away because of one grade. If you take away our sports because one C average that's like taking away our exercise. And everyone needs to exercise to stay healthy. So, that's like a threat to our health. Most kids have a C average so most students wouldn't be able to play the sport or sports they love so much, and as a principal I know you would want what's best for the students and you want to see them happy. It shouldn't matter their grade average, let the students be happy while we're young. Let us continue to exercise.

Another reason it should be changed to a C average or better is because being on sports teams is another way to make friends. A lot of people are shy but if their around the same people sometimes they can make new friends, and be more social which is good especially because we are young and many students are shy. Making new friends sometimes can help boost kids confidence, which is very helpful to students because many of them are shy, not social, and don't like talking to other people they don't know or haven't ever talk to. Sports teams is always a good way to be active and make new friends and sports are just fun!

Grade averages are for school, not for sports teams. Coaches aren't worried about the grades. Their worried about getting kids into shape and having a good time. Like say a kid a on a sports team is a really good player and the coach really needs him for the big game but the kid has a high C average. Then the kid can't play and chances are the team might lose that big game. Then everyone is going to be disappointed and that chance might not ever happen again. And that would be extremely sad because that kid might not being playing next year he might being going to a different school or something. And that could be the last chance you ever get to a big game like that. the school and the students in it would be very upset because they wouldn't be able to say that their school made it to the championships or something like that. So, please we're asking you to make it at a C average or not even get our grades involved. Thanks so much.

Sincerely,

The Students
