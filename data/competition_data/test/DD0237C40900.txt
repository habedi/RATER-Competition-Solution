There are many reasons that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. By joining with the others, you can help people who need it after World War ll.

Many countries were left in ruins. If you look in paragraph 2, it says that UNRRA, which is formed by 44 nations, helped these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. That paragraph also says that UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. It says in paragraph 5, that beside helping people, he had the side benefit of seeing Europe, China, Greece, Italy, Crete, and the Panama Canal. Not only do you get to help people, but you also are able to tour places that could be all the way around the world from where you may live.

So as you can see, there are many different benefits of being one of the Seagoing Cowboys.
