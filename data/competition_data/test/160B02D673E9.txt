Some students in schools like to participate in extracurricular activities. they may enjoy it or would rather do so than just going home after school and working on homework for hours. I, personally can't explain on why a lot of students do extracurricular activities. now in my opinion, I would not prefer to have be forced to do an extracurricular activity and I'm going to support my reasoning on why students should not have to be involved in extra curricular activities.

First of all, school already gives you enough homework. Whether you're in all honors or not, they still give you a fair amount of homework. Now, on top of that, if the principal is making students to be involved in activities such as any sport or helping with the school in any way, I believe that could cause some problems for some kids. The principal does not know how hard a certain student works or how long it takes them to complete something. Now keep in mind that the principal is unaware of that. Imagine being a student that works and tries his best on every single piece of work the school gives. It could take him a long time to complete with full effort. Now then the student is being made to be apart of a extra curricular activity. That could cause stress because he works so hard on his homework and then he's just being told to help the school or go outside. That could also be the situation for many other kids too.

Secondly, even though the principal may be in charge of the school, He's not in charge of a students life. While making a student be involved in something they not want to be involved with is totally affecting their life more than what the principal is in charge of. Again, the principal is unaware of things that could be happening somewhere else such as a student could be playing two sports at once. Do you think a kid who already plays two sports wants to be forced to help out with the school. I definitely would not want to. that is just my opinion though. I, personally would not be wanted to be involved with extracurricular activities because it just doesnt appeal to me and I would rather do things of my own choice on my own time.

Now, for the people who are involved in extracurricular activities or disagree with my thesis, listen up. As I said before, there could be so many reasons on why you are involved in these activities. Although I dont know why because I'm not involved in them, I can have a thought of why. My thought on why people are involved with activities is because they have time on their hands and they dont know what to do with it so they try out for sports or anything that is involved with school's extras. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with playing a sport or being involved in school activities, but its definitely a different story when its a requirement or mandatory. Actually, I play a sport and I enjoy it, but its because I chose that sport and its different when you have to be involved as a part of school. Which could cause messing up plans that you had later in the day or could really just be boring and you could be doing so many other things that would benefit you more than helping out with the school.

Supporting my statement from then previous paragraph, most teachers can probably point out that students dont like school. But do you actually know the percentage? The average was 89% of people who attend middle and high school, do not enjoy it according to studies experimented by Drew Ranford, a scientist from James Madison University. Imagine how many students there are in a middle school and even highschool there are. On top of that, 89% of them dont enjoy school. now picture how thrilled the majority of students would be when they hear that their principal is making them be involved in school activities. Not a single person would be thrilled apart from that 19% of people who enjoy school for some reason.

As I'm closing up with my prompt, I believe that with the principal's decision to make students be involved with extracurricular activities is a bad decision. The principal does not know what other activities a student could be doing and statistically, kids find things more annoying or boring if they are forced to do it. Saying that, if they are being made to be involved with activities at school, some kids will find it as a con as a part of their day. I think that students should be able to participate in what they choose to be in and not to have their decision made for them by the school. Now that you've read my prompt on this topic, what would you prefer instead. As this is only a made up scenario, what if this was actually happening to your school and you strongly disagreed with it? Would you stand up and attempt to make a change? Or would you just go with it because you don't believe you can change something? Because as a student, it may look like you don't have much rights against staff at the school, but I guarantee that if you explain your reasoning enough, I bet you could change something.
