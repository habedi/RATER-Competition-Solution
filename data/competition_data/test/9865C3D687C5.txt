The Seagoing Cowboys program. Why is it such a good program? I'm Luke Bomberger and I'm here to tell you why the program helps and why you should join. The Seagoing Cowboys program helps the world. Here are some reasons why the program is helpful. And, maybe why you would want to join.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy takes alot of time, but is an opportunity of a lifetime. I got to travel the world. I got to see Greece, China, Europe, and etc. And, the best thing is I got to help people and their countrys.

Also, something really cool is you still get to play the sports you like such as. Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading,and whittling. We played baseball and volleyball in empty animal holds to help pass the time. Last, being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure, it opened up the world for me.

In conclusion, the job may have been hard, but it was worth it. I got to give people hope again. I got to travel and see things I never thought I would have. That is why you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. Help the world through its hard times. Be a hero and help. Would you like to help and give hope?
