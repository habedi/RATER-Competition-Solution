The future is progressing, the internet is being used so much that most people would not know what to do without it. the internet is being used for education, jobs, and just for pure entertainment. It can be a very controversial topic weather or not the internet is benefiting or hurting young kids, especially at school. I believe that students would benefit from taking online classes at home because you could attend school even when you're sick, you could learn in a less stressful environment, and truly everyone could get an education. Although I do not think that it's the best option for everybody and we should still have school buildings and in person education, it will still benefit the people that do believe that online school is the best option for them.

One of the most stressful things for a high school student is missing classes and having to make up a bunch of work because you were sick. With online school you wouldn't have to worry about missing class and dealing with that looming stress when you should be resting. You would be able to rest, and do you're classes, on your own terms instead of going to school sick and infecting your peers with whatever illness you've contacted. This is also a great idea for kids that have a long term illness' and normally would have to be taken out of school. They could continue with the same classes just not at their school and they wouldn't have to deal with the stress of getting a new teacher.

In Generation Z, a common problem is mental illness, especially anxiety and depression. This makes the social aspect of school difficult for some people and they would most likely learn better at home where they feel the most comfortable. Although this is a great alternative for older students, I believe this reason should not be applicable to younger children, such as elementary schoolers, because it could harm the crucial social skills that they learn at that time that they might need later in life. I believe this would make the county's GPA level sky rocket because not all people focus best in an environment such as school.

My last point to make is that the education rates in the US would rise if people were given the option to take online school. One of the biggest reasons why people don't have their degree is because they had to be removed from school to work and make money for their families. By taking online school, they would have more time to work and provide for their families, while also getting their high school degree to find an even better job or seek even higher education. If this option was put in place, I believe that the graduation rates would sky rocket and the drop out rate would lower drastically.

Having the option to learn at home would not only benefit the student as an individual, but it would benefit the county that they're in and their families or future families. Giving students the choice to learn at home, or wherever they choose to learn, could possibly open up a new liking for education that the student had never felt before and make the student find what their interested in and what they want to pursue in life. Online education truly benefits everyone, and if there's a choice between online or regular school, it wouldn't hurt anyone either.Â
