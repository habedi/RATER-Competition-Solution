Dear Principal,

I think that it is unfair to make a rule you should have to be at a B GPA to participate in sports. Some people all they can get is a C GPA because some kids are smarter then others. It would help if they are at least on the team or an activity for there efforts in school. They are passing school. That means they try on there homework and they try on tests. Being on a team or activity also means they can help each other out with all this school stuff like on homework they can work together to solve a problem or they can study for a test together. Being on a team or part of an activity is being a part of something. so having a GPA of C is passing so people don't have to be all upset that they have to do extra homework and extra studying is not fun without a team to support them through it!

Thanks for listening,

Student
