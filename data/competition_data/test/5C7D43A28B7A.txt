Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should students be the ones designing their projects or should it be their teacher? If students had the opportunity to create their own project it would let them obtain higher benefits then if the teacher were to make it. As anyone knows summer is a time of fun where children get to splash around in the pool, have water gun fights, and to hangout with their friends. So by letting the students choose their projects it makes it easier on them. The advantages are high if this happens because, the students get to choose what they want to learn, make if fun for themselves, and not having to cram if the teacher gave them some thing difficult to do over the summer break.

It more or so depends on the subject the student is getting the project from, say if the student gets the project from their math teacher why not let them do a coloring project with Math using formulas or to keep it simple and easy and do a few questions every other day to keep the mind steady. Maybe in English the students could recommend a book they would like to read and they would write about their favorite thing about said book. In science the students could do bird watching as their project, as many birds are coming back from the south they could learn more about the animals that fly high in the sky and gain knowledge about their habits and niches,the students can also find new birds they never knew about in their general area which might be a cool an new thing for them and their family to try out.

If a student had the option to design their own project they would choose some thing along the lines of the examples provided in paragraph two. It would be between these main three fun, quick and easy. It's mainly up to the student if they decide to do that they might want to make hard on themselves and give themselves a challenge, but thats what makes it fun for everyone because the students get to decide how they want to make and do their project.

So in conclusion, by letting the students choose their projects it makes it easier on them. It gives them the opportunities they need to succeed, the students get to choose what they want to learn, make if fun for themselves, and still get to have a great summer vacation.
