Summer Projects

Summer projects, as a student i'm not a big fan. But in the case of this argument, I don't have a preferred side. Either way these projects stress you out on a break made for not having stress. I will not say they are a good or a bad thing because there are so many pros and cons it'd be hard to really choose. But I guess I have to in order to pass.

To start, I'm going to list some pros and cons of these projects then i'll pick a side. Lets start with pros. Summer projects, if done correctly provide some sort of education during the off school season. But usually when they are designed by teachers. Cons, there are a lot, and I have a student perspective so it makes sense. When a teacher makes the project, it requires me to actually use my brain. Summer projects takes time and energy from me. They take away time from my job that I could be out making money. So that is a pretty big con.

Since I have to choose, If anyone was going to design the summer project it has to be the teacher. They understand the curriculumÂ and how to apply it to students. Yea, it'd be awesome if students did it. Then there would be a lot less work to it. Personally it's hard to think of a reason to where a student would want to design it other than personal benefit. I'm not saying that all students would do that. But a large majority would. Students wouldnt even know where to start. They would make up some fake assignment that would take like 10 minuets to complete. Which is great and all but there would be no information transmitted over the course of the summer.

Honestly how can students design a project on information that they don't fully understand. That would be chaos. I understand why summer projects are in place. But if i'm going to be completely honest here, I don't want some kid designing what my task to do over the summer is. I see two things happening, that person will be my best friend or I'd hate their guts. There is not much more to be said in this argument. Hands down, with out a doubt teachers should design the summer projects.
