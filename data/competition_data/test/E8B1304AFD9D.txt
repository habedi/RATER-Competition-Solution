I don't think it is a good idea to not let children participate in school sports or activities if they don't have a B average. I think children should be able to play these sports or these activities if they have a C average. Some students have to do harder work then others if they are in the advanced classes. Many students don't have to try hard with one thing but another student may have to. It depends on their intelligence. I know that some students don't try very hard but what about the students that do try really hard and still get a C

average? i don't think it would be fair to all the students.

Also a student could get a bad grade on a big test and they could get a C for that class. They deserve a second chance.

One trimester could be bad for the student but they could do better in the send trimester. What happens it they can't play a sport because they get a C average then they bring their average up? most coaches or teaches of activities won't want children to go to the activities or games half way through the year. They also wont want children dropping out of that event because they have a C average. I don't think this is a very smart idea. Some kids it would work with but others it wouldn't. I think there would be a lot of complaints from parents about this. Sometimes kids have a bad week and that makes there average go down. Kids make mistakes but they should get a second chance. I hope you understand why i think enforcing this policy is not a good idea.
