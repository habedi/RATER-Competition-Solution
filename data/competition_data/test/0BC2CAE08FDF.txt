Dear principle,

Kids should be required to perform community service because there are trash bags, litter and many harmful things in life which people just think they useless and pointless but can kill people easily . By doing community service we will have a safe city and a green environment. Picking up trash is helpful just not for us but the sea animals because all that trash and garbage you throw away goes to the ocean and kills many animals. Many people take things for grantee but others care and will not stop until what they want is done.

By doing community service you can do good deeds and maybe even get rewarded. There are many people in life that perform bad deeds and get busted for them. There are fines on signs that say things like littering=$1000 fine. People disobey other people by saying so and so threw trash on the ground. If something falls out your pocket then it is your responsibility to pick that trash up. some people say why do we have to pick up trash if its not going anywhere but trash travels like when a fuzz ball goes from one place to another.

When kids take opportunity to take time off a Saturday morning they are helping the environment. When people stay home playing video games or hatching t. v eating chips those chips bags blow out of a garbage truck and kill many sea animals. A seagull can see a trash bag that looks like fish and take it up and die by swallowing the trash bag. A sea turtles favorite food is jelly fish but can easily mistaken it for a garbage or plastic bag. There are many harmful and dangerous things in life that can kill people and animals if you aren't care full where you put your trash so community service is a really good idea.

Sincerely,
