Video communication is a new technology that enables people to work closely together while being far apart. It is with this tool that online classes have become more popular and beneficial to students. Distance learning allows students the opportunity to support themselves at home because it's easy to privately access the teacher and online resources, while it's more difficult to detract from peers' learning experience.

Via online communication students can privately access the teacher at any time. In classrooms, students often don't advocate for themselves because they don't want to share their problems in front of their peers; meanwhile, teachers are left clueless as to the struggles of their students because they always deal with the class as a whole. Private communication is absurdly simple thanks to online messaging: students can send a message directly to the teacher at any time online. This allows the teacher to effectively teach and each student to understand the material.

While learning online, all the resources that a student needs are easily accessible. Any resources that a teacher would share with the students would be shared online; therefore, if a student needs any class-required resources, they will be able to access them. Additional resources that the teacher might deign to dole out amongst individual students, depending upon individual need, may also be shared in a similar manner. Many textbooks have online formats, for example, and some even have additional audio or video files exclusively for online usage. Other resources might include presentations or files, all of which can be created, shared, or viewed online. Online, a student can interact with any resources they could ever need.

Another benefit of distance learning is the lack of negative interaction with peers. In physical classrooms a teacher cannot constantly monitor every student's actions, so students have the opportunity to cheat off each other during tests or assignments. While online it is still possible to interact with other peers, students are less likely to circumnavigate positive learning experiences to inflict negative ones on another student. Another example would be due to a recent event: COVID-19. Students who would only have the chance to interact in a physical setting, won't interact at all, which decreases the chance of the virus spreading unnecessarily.

Online classes are overall beneficial to students because of the easy access to everything online that they would need. Some may argue that distance learning is not as beneficial to students because there are distractions, a lack of physical resources, and access to the internet; however, in a comfortable setting students will be easier able to work at their own pace regardless of distractions, there are infinite resources online to compensate a lack of physical resources, and in this era everyone has constant access to the internet anyway. Distance learning is the gateway to the future: jobs have gotten more technologically advanced, why haven't schools?
