Both sides have good arguments when it comes to the development of driverless cars. On one side, technology is making up enough of these cars and these cars may cause more traffic problems. On the other side, this could end pollution as we know it. However, I know that certain things are inevitable and pollution is one of those. Therefore, I am going to vote against driverless car development.

Most of my reasons go towards the overall safety. According to the passage, " Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers." Alert driving prevents car crashes, time in the hospital, and, the biggest of them all, lawsuits. With these driverless cars, how can we prevent something bad happening? For example, say you're sitting your driverless car and you're in the middle of a traffic jam. The car overloads and begins to automatically pick up speed. Despite your attempts to stop the car, your'e going 120 mph in a traffic jam. All of a sudden, you crash into a building, and injure yourself, not to mention four passengers and three pedestrians.

Not only does this put your hospital bill a little bit out of your price range, but you have to pay for damages and lawsuits. Think about how many deaths/injuries that would cause. Also, it costs a lot to put these driverless cars together. The whole world could go bankrupt by putting at least 50 of these cars on the road. It's not like American is that rich.

According to the passage, Google attempted to make driverless cars in 2009. However, it was proved that those cars were not completely driverless, due to the fact that it still alerts "the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents." In my opinion, Google made yet another smart car. Though TV, movies and, video games contemplate the idea of cars that drive themselves (Cars 1&2), in reality, it might not happen.

In conclusion, driverless cars will be a problem, unless the technology for this car develops, which it probably will in the future. Newsflash, cars that can drive themselves are not real. ( Well, they're not real yet. That's for the future to decide.) Anyways, that is why I'm against the devlopment of these "driverless cars."
