Dear Senator,

I think we should change our voting method from the Electoral College to popular vote. The Electoral College consists of only 538 people. That's pretty much saying 538 people in America get to choose who our next president is. I think it should be set up by popular vote because their are millions of people in the U.S. that are able to vote, and each individual person's vote should count. The Electoral College is wrong because if there are about 100,000 people voting in a state, and 60,000 people vote for the Democratic side, and 40,000 votes for the Republican side, the Electoral College votes will go to the Democratic president and those other 40,000 Republicans would have voted for nothing. The Electoral College is one of the main reasons half of America doesn't vote. If one state wins the Republican electoral votes every single year, the Democrats will just stop voting. Then most of the Republicans will stop voting because they know they will win, and this will happen in every state until about 25% of America is voting, or possibly less. The popular vote gives evrybody a chance to win.

I do think the Electoral College is better in some ways though. First of all, the Electoral College is full of people that know why they're voting. They know about their candidates and what their candidates are going to do for the U.S. Most of the population that votes in the popular vote don't know why they're voting. They vote simply on if somebody is black or white, Democratic or Republican. I bet if most of America's voters did some research on their candidates, the polls would be very different. I think another good thing about the Electoral College is that the bigger the population of a city, the more Electoral votes it has. If you win the Electoral Vote, you are most likely going to win the popular vote. And another plus side is that a candidate can not rely on a single region to win. He has to be in the favor of multiple regions in order to win the Election. These are some reasons against the thought of popular vote.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME
