Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I agree on policy two, that there should be no cell phones allowed in school.

I think that if we would choose policy one, students wouldn't obey the policy. Even though Students would enjoy using their cell phones at lunch and other free-times, they would most likely sneak their phones and text during a lesson in class. Also, if the school allowed cell phones, students might forget to turn their phone off, and it would ring. The ringing cell phone would be a distraction to other students, disabling learning. I don't think students need to be using their cell phones at lunch and other free time because most of their friends that they would text or call would be in the same room.

If we chose policy two, there wouldn't be any distractions because there wouldn't be any cell phones at all.

What is more important? Having students not be able to use their cell phones during free time, or students not being able to learn because of cell phone distractions? Students not being able to learn is more important, and that is why I choose policy two, to have no cell phones in school at all.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
