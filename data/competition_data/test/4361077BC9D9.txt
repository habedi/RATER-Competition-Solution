Which is better to have in the future a driverless car or a driver car? Well I think that a driverless car is better for the future than a driver car. There are multiple reasons as to why I believe this ,such as the fact that a diverless car is more flexable with public transportation than a driver car like a bus. Although a driver car has its perks like being able to park and re-route through traffic and accidents. However does a driverless car have pros and cons?

Yes a diverless car has it's pros and cons like if the Dubbed LIDAR (roof senser) went out than the car would not be able to mimic the skill of a human driver. Some of the pros to being in a driverless car are it can detect danger before the driver and has multiple safety proticals to make sure that anyone in the car won't get hurt. Driveless cars also have the ablity to speed up to 25mph in a traffic jam, although in a way a driverless car still depends on a human driver for alertness.

So would it be good to build cars like these for the future? I say yes. I would support making a driverless car because it can really help people in life. It also makes driving much safer and easier.
