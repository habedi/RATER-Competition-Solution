Can you imagine having a computer that will communicate with you? Or just having one?

Today people are making computer that can communicate with you. It can also read your face expressions. Threre are 40 plus facial expressionson and the computer can pick up on it. By he computer having all of that hightech things that might mean it can do more things. If it can pick up on a painting, then it can pick up on people during my time.

It can be valuable because it can tell you how other people are feeling when they use the computer. It says "New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others", meaning they can detect how peope are feeling or what they are hiding.

But, at the same time this is useless because all it does is pick up face exprssions. In the article thats the only thing it talks about and there is no point on having that certain technology. In my opinion this will be an ok software . It will come in handy somties but not 100%.

How do you feel about ths software? Will you like it or would you pass on it?
