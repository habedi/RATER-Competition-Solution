Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think this issue have benefits, advantages, and disadvantages because it is a good option firstly, to people that have disabilities because they are not able able to attend school as the others students for the reasons that is to difficult and dangerous to them because of their conditions andÂ the routine that schools have.

Moreover, classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a good option to those students that are persons that leave school at early age for any reasons and now they are older that want the opportunity to continue school, classes from home can give to them that opportunity to finish school, to learn something that they are interesting, a specific subject that they want to develop like: art, play any instrument, mathematics. Also, to learn something that help them for work like: mechanic, cosmetology, or computation.

In addition, classes from home can be benefit for those students that have biggest responsibilities as a student that have to work because of have a family that need him or a student that get pregnant, she is not able to attend school for the circumstances that will be dangerous for her and her baby however, classes from home can gives her the opportunity to continue and not stop with her goal to finish school.

Furthermore, classes from home have advantages and disadvantages. Some advantages that I think that classes from home are: the student can take classes in his comfort from home, do not get frustrated, and take the classes at any time he want. I think classes from home have disadvantages because the student not will learn in the same way as the others and that will affect them because of they will not get the same knowledge, the opportunity to be sociable, and express their ideas to others.

Thus, I conclude that classes from school is a good option for those students that want study but for some reasons they are not able to attend school, some reasons like disabilities, older that cannot go to school as others young student, students that have a work and biggest responsibilities, or a student that going to be mother. this will offer the opportunity to continue studying. however, attend school from home have disadvantage as to share and be sociable with others.
