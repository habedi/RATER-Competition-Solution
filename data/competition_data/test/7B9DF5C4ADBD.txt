Many people hid there emotions while others are very open. When someone smiles does that really mean they are happy or is it just a mask conceiling their true emotions. Not many people are very open even with themselves. When times were simplier people how either hid there emotions or speak freely about them. Now in this new day and age a man named Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman institute has created a machine that can tell what you are feeling even if you are hidding it.

I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. The reason i am for and not against is because this machine can actually save lives. For those who pretend to be happy and are actually depressed they the machine can pick that up and that person/student can get the help and teatment they need. This can help because this machine can detect "happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."

This can be found in paragraph 3. With this new technology it observes the face that will look at your face and look at all the muslces in the face and calculate it to see how you are feeling even if you try and hid it. Everthing is about the muscles in your face that can conduct how you are feeling. In this article it talk about how they tested this by using video imagery where they had people use a computer and they would flash pictures and the device would examine the face to see how they were feelng. They had did this a few times to test it.

In conclusion, they should use this to read studnets emotions because they maybe depressed and it could save lives. If someone is to angry they cold harm soemone but with this new technology this can prevent many things like that. They can detect things like emotions because the machine looks at the muscles on the face to determine weather you are sad, happy, angry etc;
