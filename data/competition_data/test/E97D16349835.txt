If you were able to attend school from home that would't be the best choice, and the reasons why is cause you would be getting lazy and you would e getting used to that laziness, for me i rather go to school to actually learn and not at home cause i know for sure im going to slack off most of the time,

Being home schooled would sound nice but depending on the things that your learning, You can start class any time when your being home schooled, i mean hey i dont want to wake up early to go to a public school i mean no kid wants to wake up early just for that, being home schooled is nice cause you can do whatever you want while doing work, waking up late wouldnt be bad it would sound nice, students being home schooled have some lack of education cause they got used to becoming lazy and not doing anything theres no teacher to tell him/her what to do they can do whatever they want with no teacher to bother them.

but over all attending to being home school wouldnt sound to bad but being home schooled is expansive isnt it ? compaered to a public school..........
