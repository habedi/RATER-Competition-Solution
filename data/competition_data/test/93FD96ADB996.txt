Human emotions have been around about as long as humans have. For milenia humans have been able to convey feelings through facial expressions for many hundreds of years. Peole have also figured out ways to fake or force emotions if they feel it necessary and have been doing so for hundreds of years. While classrooms are newer but feel boring to most,they are a big part of life. Classrooms might be boring, and while it has become possible to use new technology to make learning fun, but this begs the question, is it practical?

Computers are newer and facial recognition is on the rise but is the facial recognition software fit for a classroom? Facial recognition software might be available,but as the article mentions,personal computers can't handle the software. How are schools supposed to use something that requires a larger computer with only a small amount of money to spend? The article also doesn't mention how costly the software itself is so it could be too costly for schools. Most schools simply do not have the kind of money required for this new technology.

The new software could be used to make lesson plans more fun but is that practical. Ignoring how the schools would get this new software,the practical use of it has a cost of its own. Changing lesson plans to be more fun may sound practical,but what about the cost and different types of learning? There are different types of learning,auditory,visual,hands on,and probably more types of learning,but how are schools supposed to cater to those who like to learn differently than the rest? The methods of putting these other types of learning into effect would be far too costly for most schools an would probably require even more software and other technology.

The costs of practical facial expression recognition software usage are big but ignoring that, will people accept a comuter watching their facial expressions? Though the article mentions about facial expressions and analyzing them, it fails to take into account how people feel about this. According to the article,this software could be used to tell if a student is bored,but would students be comfortable with a machine that could tell how they were feeling just watching them as it taught? Many students would feel uncomfortable being watched constantly especially by a computer that could analyze how they were feeling. Not to mention the fact that for some forms of learning the computer might be forced to move around with the help of other technology to give examples which might make students more uncomfortable.

In conclusion while facial reading software seems like a good idea,maybe it isn't. The software wouldn't be compatible with school computers. The cost of replacing the computers and putting the new and more fun learning techniques into practice would be very costly. Many students would feel uncomfortable with this new technology and some things students are forced to learn simply can't be made fun easily. While it might seem like a good idea on the surface,some things just aren't practical.
