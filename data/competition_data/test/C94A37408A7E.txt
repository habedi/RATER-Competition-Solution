Which policy would I want; 1. allow students to use phones during lunch and other free time or 2. don't allow student to use there phones at all. Which would be better? Who knows? Well, as a student I would go with policy number two. Reason for that would be because I like to have my phone available, makes me feel safe, and just feel weird without it.

Having my phone with me makes me feel important. Without it I just seem like some normal kid. Cell phones could also help in good ways. I could use if for researching, calculating and to help see what i want to write.

Also my phone makes me feel safe. To me, not having my phone is like driving a car without seat belts. Also know as dangerous. Sometimes when I think there's an emergency I like to have my phone so I could contact my mom, dad, sister, brother or anybody I need. Phones aren't just for having fun texting, calling, going on the internet or things of that nature. Some kids actually use them for safety reasons and emergencies.

Lastly, I just feel weird not having my phone. Its like a mom having to leave her son at a daycare for the first time. When I don't have a phone it seems like I can feel every text message and phone call vibrate right there in my pocket as if it was there. Then i look dumb looking for it, knowing its not there.

So, if I chose any policy it would be policy two because, I like having my phone available, makes me feel safe and it feels weird not having it.
