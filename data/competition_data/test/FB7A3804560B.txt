Dear Principal

I think to make the school system better that community service is a good idea to do because. The students learn more about staying out of trouble. Because when you are in trouble u see that u will steal have work to no matter what because staying is not a good thing so they show you by making you do community service. And maybe that will show you how to stay out of trouble and some people in joy doing community service because it makes them feel better about. Helping other and just cleaning is always helpful to your community to show how you care and you want things to look better to show that you have a great community and you like keeping it clean and you would like others in your community to do the same to show that you care. Then if the community is clean maybe new people will come and like what they see about your community and would like to move in. So yes to me community service is a good idea.
