In my opinion I believe the principal nor the school has the right to make someone join extracurricular activities. Sometimes after-school we have things to do just like the teachers instead of playing sports or joining a club. We could be doing something useful like homework, helping our parents, or making dinner. If the principal makes use do after-school activities im going to join a club or maybe try a new sport like volleyball or maybe i could even try flag football.

Therefore, the principal does not have the right to make us do any sort of sport because the last time i read the handbook i didnt see anything about having to do 1 extracurricular activities, but on the other hand if i wasnt busy after school i would most likely try out for the soccer team because soccer is one of my favorites to do at school because sometimes i get to play with my friends.

I hardly disagree with this whole argument because it would feel and look like regular school all over again even though we meet on different days the school will still be very packed full of a bunch of kids and the school will have to pay the lunch ladies and the bus drivers extra money.

In conclusion, i believe that the principal should just let the kids try out for sports that they want to try out for and not have to force them because they are not only hurting us by putting pressure on us but they are alao hurting the schools budget.
