While some people say that summer projects that are assigned over the summer should be created by teachers, it should be created by students, because it allows for students to: connect better with others, create better quality work, and allow for better planning for student schedules over the summer. These can benifit the sutendent more then having a teacher plan the projects.

The first reason for projects to be created by students is that it allows for better connections in topics. Students can create topic ideas or structures, that best fit the students needs and allows them to connect or create friendships through these topics. For example, when I had a group science project the teacher allowed for the groups to choose their own topic, this allowed for collaboration and more connectivity. Connectivity can be importent for people over the summer because it makes a project that they dont want to do a lttle more fun. This can create frindships and bonds with people.

The next reason is that it allows for students to make better work. Students can pick a topic that interests themselfs or other students, and this allows for more focus on the topic. For example, when I go looking for a job I look for a few things, benifit to me and if it fits my intrests. If I were to have a job that I find is boring and that I dont find intresting then I will not preform as effectively. This is the same with so many other people and it can perfectly translate in to doing projects which allows for more productive and well thought out work.

The final reason for students-designed projects is better time management. As a student over summer the last thing that you want to do is to do school projects outside of school. With these students-designed projects it allows for students to plan how their fellow students or even how they themself will spend their summer. One example, is that as a student, I can relate to how other students will spend their time and I can plan according to how I or others will spend their time. This can allow for better work from those students as it might not interfere with other things over the summer.

While some might say that, teachers can allow for a more rigorous and better structure for learning, it is more benifitial towards learning to allow students to pick the topics that interest them. It can allow for more productivity and better work quality.
