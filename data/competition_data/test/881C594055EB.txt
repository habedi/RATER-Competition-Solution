Dear Mr. Principal

This letter is to inform you in what position I take in this community service act your planing to dump on all the students. Personally I think it's wrong to force these kids to perform community service. There are students that don't want to perform community service and I say don't make those students do it! For the students that actually want to perform community service i suggest that the school work with them and help them clean up a little. Maybe even reward them perhaps with a free one hundred or whatever you may have in mind. Don't you think that sounds a little bit more reasonable, Mr. Principal? For example, its three pm the students are just getting out of school to go clean the sides of the street. A student has three assignments he needs to complete before the end of tomorrow but he's stuck here cleaning until six-thirty pm and by the time he gets home its seven already and his parents tell him its time to start getting ready for bed. Now the student has three incomplete assignments that's three zeros and could cause him to fail for the six weeks, and its all because he had to perform community service. Just think, all the parents and conference meetings you will have to go through because of angry parents. Mr. Principal, please don't force our students into doing community service. We have enough things to worry about as it is. The kids who want to clean, they can clean. I hope I changed your mind Mr. Principal..

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
