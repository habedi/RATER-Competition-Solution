There are many different types of people at school. There are athletes, creative, hard-working, and many others. If they were told that they had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity at school, I think there would be multiple opinions about it. I think that students should not be forced into doing a school activity for three reasons. Their time, their effort, and their stress.

The first reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples time/schedule. If someone for example, would choose sports and the sports practices were after after school. If they didn't have the time to practice from 3:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M. or couldn't practice form 5:00 A.M. to 8:00 A.M. then it would be a pretty rough schedule. Another example is when I was playing basketball for my Middle School team. We had practice everyday and it was very tiring. Some people might just want to go home and sleep or sit on the couch and watch tv instead of doing a activity. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of time.

The second reason why I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity is because of peoples effort. Some people might not like any of the options that the school offers so they might not put all their effort into whatever activity they pick. For example, if a very creative and artistic person looks at all of the options and they are all sport related they will not really care what they pick because that is not what they really like to do. Another example is when my cousins and I went to a arts and crafts place where you could build or draw anything you could imagine. I didn't put as much effort as some as my cousins because arts and crafts is not mt favorite thing to do. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of effort.

Lastly, I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of stress. Some people can get stressed out very easily when they have to do something new or there is a lot to do. For example, if someone was taking all of the most advanced classes you could take and then they had to choose something else to worry about could make a lot of stress. They would have a lot because of how much stuff they would have to worry about. Another example is when I was playing basketball and trying to study for 3 tests I had the next day. It was a lot of stress and made me get headaches because I was focused on too much. I think that students shouldn't be forced to do a school activity because of stress.

I disagree with students being forced to do a school activity because of three reasons. Their time and how it can make your schedule crazy. Their effort and how much a person likes the options or not. And lastly their stress and how it can make your life have to much to handle.
