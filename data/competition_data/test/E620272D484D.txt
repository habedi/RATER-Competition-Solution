Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. do you think students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home. Yes students would definitely benefit from this new option in meany ways, for example people who have medical problems, people who live in remote areas, and people who need to work wile going to school.

People with medical problems some times are not able to attend school, this would give them the ability to go to there classes with out being there in person. Giving them the ability to finish the school year and not having to do a another year of school just because they missed something in the hospital. Kids now always have connection to the internet so why should not they be able to go to school on there devices we literary can do everything else, why not be able to go to school on you phone too.

People who live in more remote areas far from any school would also benefit with the ability to go to school online, instead of having a long and hard commute could just log on and have schooling right in front of them in a mater of seconds in stead of hours. Kids in more rural areas would also have more flexible hours being able to attend to there responsibilities at home and continue with there schooling. This could also save the family money too with out having to pay for transportation or gas the money could go to more important things.

This program would also help people who need to work and go to school at the same time. this could give them more flexible hours to work and provide money for there family and college. Online schooling could also help people stay in school instead of dropping out to get a job with the some hours as the school to support themselves and there families, with this program they could do both support there families and go to school.

Learning is a right no matter the person or there problems they should still have the ability to go to a school and have a good education even if its on the computer in a hospital, or a Mouton, or even at work. u should always have the ability to have a education.
