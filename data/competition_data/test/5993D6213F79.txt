What if your principal decided that all of his students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Would you go through with it or disagree. You could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or even serve on the student council. I think its a bad idea because we already have enough things to do for our other classes. We have homework, projects, etc. It will prevent more and more stress on all of the students.

I disagree because if we already have things to do at home or if we have other sports that we chose to do, it will interact with them. We will have to do so much stuff we would have to give up one of are sports or whatever you do. It might also impacts how late we get home. Our parents also might not want us to get home late because then they will have to be up late and get us and might be late to work the next morning or worrying about us for what time we will be home. We shouldn't be out late like past ten, or something for your sports or whatever the reason is .

Our parents would have to pay more money for us to do another activity. It will be a problem if someones family wasÂ not that type of family who had lot of money, especially if they have multiple kids that do sports. If our parents did not make enough money or have lost their job, how would they pay for the sports? Would the principal consider to let them not do a extra activity or will he pay himself? If I was the principal I would not make my students do a extra activity.

I personally think if we would have to do another activity or class I would lose it, I would be so mad. Because I already have enough stuff and stress I don't need anymore to it. I would honestly not do the extra activity even if I HAD to do it. I think it's stupid.

What would you do if your principal made you do another class or activity, would you be mad or happy? I would be mad.
