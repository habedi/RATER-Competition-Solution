In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author states how new technology can help students. I believe this to be true. I think it is true becasue if the Facial Action Coding System actually works then it can switch the students lesson up and help them learn.

One reason I think it will work is because as a student I personally tend to get bored and doze off and get distracted. I also know this happens to other kids because too because when i'm bored I look around the room so i see all the other students who are not paying attention. If a student were toget mad and the computer sensed this and changed up the lesson then that could get the student back into it and make them want to do the work. these computers would make it the same as having a perfect teacher there for every student.

In conclusion I think that the "Facial Action Coding System" is valuble to us and every student. I think they could really help students who struggle with being bored and just not understanding things in school. The End
