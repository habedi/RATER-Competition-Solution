Phones and Driving

Knowing how society is today and knowing how technology plays a major role in some people's lives, I believe that people should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. The people in this society are so addicted to their cellphones, it can be super dangerous to be using them while driving. The more time people use their cellphones while driving, the less aware they will be of their surroundings on the roads, which can typically lead to more accidents. Drivers should always stay focused on the road and nothing but the road. Here are some reasons why.

One of the main reasons why you should not use a cell phone while driving is to be able to focus more on where you are going and your surroundings. The use of a cell phone can get you distracted, which could lead to you getting lost or it could lead to a fatal car accident. It is very dangerous to be distracted while you are driving. The quickest few seconds you take just to look at your phone can be risking the lives of others and yourself. To prevent that from happening, you should keep your phone on silent so it would not be a distraction to you.

Another reason why you should not be on your phone while driving is because of the safety of others. When you are driving with other people in the car, you should always consider their safety, as well as yours. Once you start distracting yourself from the road, you are putting the other passengers lives in danger. Not only should you consider the safety of your passengers, but you should also consider the safety of the people on the same road as you. You have to be cautious of the pedestrians and the other drivers on the road.

Most of the states are making it illegal to text and drive. States are making this an illegal law because of the amount of deaths caused by texting and driving. Making texting and driving illegal will help decrease the number of deaths from this cause. Getting caught texting and driving can result in getting fined.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why you should never text and drive. It is the most dangerous thing to do while driving. Even though it is very dangerous to be on your phone while driving, there are many alternatives. Instead of driving, you can pull over to the side of the road and respond to your message. Another solution is to give your phone to the passenger in the passenger's seat so they can respond to any messages. The most safest solution is to turn it off and put it in the middle console of your car, that way, you wouldn't be tempted to even look at it. That is why I believe people should not text and drive.
