Dear, TEACHER_NAME,

I have been informed that there is a school issue regarding whether students should be required to perform community service. Students should be required to perform community service. I think it would really say something about our school and SCHOOL_NAME would take a leader role in the community. The students should be out helping the community rather than sitting on the couch eating potato chips. In just one hour, there can be a lot of beneficial improvements towards the community. This service can also count towards kids National Junior Honor Society and service hours for Conformation or Bar/Bat Mitzvah's. Service hours can show a lot about someone's character and I think if all students were required to do this, everyone's character would build and get better. The community as a whole would become much better. Students can learn from helping out the community and might find a passion for a particular service. Others will realize that all these students are really trying to make a nicer community and then the other's will feel obligated to help out too. It takes a special person to really be dedicated to community service. The students will learn more about themselves and what they can do that will really help out society. If students start making positive attributes to the community you might see less crimes going around. This will also lead to students making better decisions and seeing themselves as a different person. Students will be honored by their community and should realize how much you put into to your community is how much your community will give back.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
