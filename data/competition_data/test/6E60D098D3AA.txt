Due to the fact that teachers give students many projects throughout the year and is based on teachers perspective this summer project will give students a chance to see what they have learned throughout the year. Students should be able to choose their own summer projects.

One reason why students should choose their summer project is because, their ideas of this project will be based on the students knowledge. Students will have a better understanding coming from their point of view also their project will show that they have understood the lesson and the criteria for this project. For example, teachers will give students a grade based on the students effort and understanding. If teachers give students the same project, students will be tempted to copy from another student and won't deserve that grade. Students can gain higher level skills for not just for school but also for life. This is a great way to show teachers that the level of improvement that students have shown when choosing their own projects.

Students believe that teachers choose projects throughout the school year and this is their time to show what have they learned throughout the year. For instance, if students struggle with the teacher project and don't understand what the project is trying to refer students won't put as much effort in the project as if it was their own project. However, it has been said that students have a better chance in doing better when they but their mind to it. I as a student, believe that I do much better when I choose my own projects. Also us students don't get many opportunity to chose our own project during the year.

Students will have a variety of projects to chose from. Students have the summer which gives them a better opportunity to think of ideas. Students can pick a topic that their most confident in doing.

Some might say, that teacher have a better understanding then students. There are many pros and cons to teacher choosing the summer assignment. For example, teacher might have a summer project that helps the students understand more about what they have learned throughout the school year. From what I have experienced students succeed more when they choose their own projects.

In conclusion , It has been shown that students understand more from their own point of view than teacher point of view. Therefore, Students should be able to choose their summer projects.
