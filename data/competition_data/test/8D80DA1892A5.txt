Not everyone wants to be bored and not everyone wants to do stuff.

I disagree because not everyone wants ot has time for extracurriculars.

First, is it nessacery and is it needed? Second, not everyones gonna have time for it.

Lastly, not everyones gonna like it. Nobody should be forced to do something they dont wanna do or enjoy.

First, An extracurricular isn't needed.

It's not a subject or anything you need to graduate.

If the student wanna s do it they can but if they don't want to they shouldnt be forced into. They are fun and they have alot of activites you can enjoy and have fun with but not everyone enjoys that type of stuff.

Second, Not everyone gonna have time for it. They will have class time but sometimes class time isnt enough time to finsih stuff which makes it homework. They could have homework for anthor class and that just makes more homework for them. Sports and family functions are usally planned for after school and if the students have that they're not gonna be able to make time for that and alot of homework.

Lastly, not everyones gonna enjoy it.

If a student is forced to do something there is a great chance they're not gonna care and not try and end up failing the class which dosen't look good. They could stop turning in assiments and end up getting F's and fail the class. If the students wanna do i they can. They should be able to pick and enjoy and have instrest in the classes they pick and have a choice. If they don't wanna do an extracurricular they shouldn't be forced into it becaure they're not gonna enjoy it.

Nobody likes being told what to do and being forced into something isn't enjoyable. Having a choice in the stuff you wanna do and enjoy is a good thing.
