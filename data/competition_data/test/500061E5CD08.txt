Many people in the world have always wondered if any other planet is able to sustain life, but no scientist really knows that for sure. The scientists and researchers in this article, are trying to evaluate and see if Venus has the ability to sustain life or any organism. The author of this article uses various descriptions and pieces of evidence that they know of, to try to find ways that Venus is a lot more than we think it is. The author included past attempts, the location of the planet and geographical features, and by simply adding information that most people did not know about Venus.

To begin, the author uses many examples of past experiements and attempts made by astronomers and NASA administators to convince the reader that Venus should still continue to be explored despite the past failed attempts. In the article, it states, "each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours," and it also says, "maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decaded...Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us." These two quotes show that the failed attempts and facts about past attempts, they still give the author hope that they will continue to keep trying to fully explore Venus, entirely. In addition to the past experiments, the author also includes things that they do know about Venus to convince that Venus is very worthy of studying. In this article, he includes, ''often referrred to as Earth's 'twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms density and size," while also saying, "astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." The author most likely uses this quote to show how similar Venus is to Earth, and to hint that if Venus is so similar to Earth we should definitely continue to keep studying Venus and to hopefully make a discovery. The author includes, "long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth... furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit." This quote shows that the author is comparing Venus to Earth because of the many similarities that they share.

To finallize, the author supports the idea of studying and/or traveling to Venus to learn more about it and to see what all the planet holds. He uses examples of past attempts of discovery, facts about Venus in general, and also features that this unexplored planet holds. He is very interested in what he feels could be a great discovery and an amazing experience to gain a lot of unknown information. Even though the discovery may be dangerous, the author still gives examples and evidence to show why he thinks this mysterious planet is a worthy pursuit.
