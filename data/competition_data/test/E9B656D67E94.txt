Not many can imagine life without a car. Yet despite how essential these machines may seem to our daily routines, the modern-day automobile is in fact another redundant aspect in our pursuit of more efficent transportation. The fact and concept of pollution comes into play.

On a sunny day in the streets of Paris the sky runs a depressing gray, and it feels difficult to breath. Paris is known for its near-record pollution, prompting officals  to enforce a temporary cesation in the use of automobiles. As Robert Duffer States in the article "Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog": "On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)," this procedure has been followed to the letter and approximately 4,000 drivers were fined in total. Subsequently, the net amount of smog has been drasticaly reduced over time, with ignorant blames on diesel as a correlatin to France's favor of it over gasoline which completely ignored the other constituant:the effect cold and warm wheather itself had in the proces of containing CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) and other pollutants in the lower layers of the atmosphere. However, the desired levels of pollution have been reached, and the ban on driving lifted.

With the concept of pollution among others, the future of the automobile as we know it is being threatened with extinction. Perhaps one day when China completes its plans for an intercontinental Mag-Lev transportation system and when Virgin Mobile perfects its new scram-jet design in tandem with Lockheed-Martin as well as Elon Musks countless innovations in electrical engineerng, the human race will look upon this era with pride to know what they've come from and what they've achieved thus far.
