As many of you know, community service is a important part of our lives, whether you know it or not. Yet some students take the subject much too serious while others take the subject as if it was nothing but a joke. In my opinion, community service is a great thing that everyone should enjoy doing because it helps everyone who one day might help you when you're in need.

A few reasons why we should require all students to perform a community service in some way is that, one, community service is not a waste of time that you use for what you need or want to do. It is simply a task that helps others. A few minutes of picking up trashes in the park by your house or helping elders cross the street is not too much to ask. I mean it is only a few minutes out of 1440 minutes per day, or perhaps only a few minutes per week, and that is only a few minutes out of 9080 minutes! So think about if can just stop play your video games or get of the couch for once and go outside and help others! As Rachel Scott once said, "Even the tiniest thing can start a chain reaction."

If you are a very selfish person, then shame on you, but you can still do community service. Community service is not just about helping others. Think about it, when you pick out trash on the street you live on, it doesn't just benefic others, it also benefic you because it is the street that you are living on. Same thing goes to school. If you clean out the trash on the school field, it will make the school look better. And believe me when I say this, people often judge books by the cover. So if you want visitors to think that the school you are in is a great school and the students in it are great students, stick around after school and help. As my teacher once said, "If you want to be smart and intelligent, you have to look professional first."

Last but definitely not least, when you go to high school, then up to college, they look at the things you have done in the past, such as clubs, sports and guess what, community service is also one of them. Research has shown that even if you are extremely smart, many colleges won't take you in unless you have some sorts of club, sport, or community service experience. So if you really would like to go to a good college and have a high paying job and live a successful life, do community service for that might, and probably will change the direction in which your life is heading to.

So once again, i suggest that community service should be required in the school, because it shapes our character as a thoughtful, caring, and a good person. And also because it is very important in our school lives and even our future personal lives. In doing so, you will have a extraordinary experience that many other won't be able to have. So please require that students must do community service.
