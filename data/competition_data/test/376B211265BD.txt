Dear Principal,

I agree with you when you say that students need to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. Sports are important to some kids, but there are other things that are important, particularly school. School is what takes you places in life. You can still get places without school, but you won't receive the benefits of better pay, an education, and many other things.

Sports are good for children. They get exercise, have fun, and learn lessons about being a team. I myself love sports and spend a lot of time practicing and playing sports. I don't think I would be allowed to continue to play sports if I had bad grades. My parents definitely wouldn't allow it and I don't think I would let myself play if I wasn't doing well in school. You definitely should change the policy so that students will know where their priorities will be.

If kids think that all they need to focus on his sports, then they are wrong. You probably aren't going to be a professional athlete considering the odds against you. You have a very slim chance and have to be amazing at the sport you play. If you do become a professional, then good for you, but it probably won't happen. This means that if you spend all of your time practicing and not working on schoolwork and then don't become a professional athlete, all that time will have been wasted and you will be behind almost all the students. You can still excel at the sport you play if you have good grades. I would definitely change the policy if I were you.
