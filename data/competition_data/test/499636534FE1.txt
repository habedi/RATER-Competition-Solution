The face on mars is a landformation. People would argue it isnt but keep in mind that isnt the case with this. With people argueing that it isnt they think aliens did it but that may not have happend. The face of Mars has to be a landformation.

The face on mars is a landformation because natural occurances happen. This could have happend fromm a meteor strike or the winds in Mars. Not to mention if the clouds in mars are constant then finding this twice on over a 20 year period should still be the same fro slow winds and mild weater.

Many people belive aliens were the cause of the face. Well thats nearly impossible if you consider the aliens were made in mars. Life forms take upon millions of years to grow and need about 60 degree weather on average and mars has below freezing average. Plus if theree were life on Mars, there should be green on Mars because of plants. People also think its aliens because of the lattitude changed. Well this is because the camera that had to take this picture had to be on a cloudy storm probaly causeing some small problems but nothing minor.

At the end I think the face is a landformation and that life could not of done this. It solid evidence. I mean stuff on earth happens like that all the time and people dont care, it is like how you see a bunny on the moon but in reality they are just cooled down oceans of lava. So the face on Mars in my opinion is a landformation.
