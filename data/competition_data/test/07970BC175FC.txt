Some schools require students complete a summer project to assure they continue learning during their break.

Many students; however, are typically done with the school year before it is even over, they want nothing more than to leave and enjoy their break.

It is difficult for some students to pay attention and do their work in the final weeks of school, so to be sure students will complete their projects, the teacher should not make it themselves.

Summer projects should be designed by students to make sure they are interested, and to make sure they have a say in how much work should go into it.

Students should not be expected to do a lot of work during their summer break.

That is their time off, their time to relax and clear their minds.

The project that they are required to do should not be difficult, and it should not require an unrealistic amount of time and effort to complete it.

They should not have to work for an extended period of time to complete a project that may or may not even be graded.

That is why it should be up to the students to decide what the project is going to be and how much time it should take to complete it.

It is important for the students to come up with their own project ideas so they stay interested when it comes time to work on them.

It could be hard for students to complete a project that was assigned to them that has not peaked their interest.

It goes without saying that if a project is assigned to them by a teacher then it might not be fun or interesting to the student.

There is no way to tell if something will be interesting to someone unless they come up with the idea themselves.

It is a possibility that students will not take the project seriously.

It might not matter regardless of if the project was assigned to them or they came up with the idea.

Students might also think that, since they are on summer break, there is no reason to do the work because they assume that they will not have to turn the project in.

Or they could try to get away with doing the bare minimum so that they can get credit for completing the assignment.

There is no way to force a student to do work, but the chances are that the students that didn't complete the project were not going to do it, even if it was assigned by a teacher.

In conclusion, it should be up to students to design the projects they have to do over summer break so that they are interested, and they know exactly what they have to do.

Students are already expected to do a lot of work during the school year, if they are also expected to do work during summer break it should be something that they choose to work on.

There is a possibility of students not taking the project seriously, but teachers should trust that it is still better for students to decide for themselves what it is their project is going to be.
