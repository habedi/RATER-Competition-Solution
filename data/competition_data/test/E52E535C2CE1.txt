Dear Mrs. Principal

I think that students should not be able to participate in sports if they have no less than a B average. I think this because some students are very gifted in sports but have very poor grades. This way by not letting students play sports without at least a B average they will be motivated to make their grades better so they can play sports. Also if the students with less than B averages drop out of a certain sport then that makes room for more players who have always wanted to play that sport, whatever that sport may be. Another reason I support having a B average or above to play sports is the students with less than B averages will drop out and give other players that are already on the team more playing time. Finally I think you should not let players with less than B averages play sports because maybe if they stop playing sports for a while they could focus on homework or studying for a test. Thank you for your time and for listening to what I had to say.

Your Student,
