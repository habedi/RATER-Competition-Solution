I don't think it's fair to let only B averaged students play sports. There are a lot of reasons why this is absolutely unfair. There are a lot of students that aren't able to participate in sports because of grades witch isn't fair, and why may you ask. I will tell you why.

If a student loves sports and can't play because of grades well that's like taking away his passion for something. There may be a reason that they're not a B student. They may possibly be struggling in school. If they're struggling in school then how are they ever supposed to be able to play sports. If they are struggling and trying there hardest and can only get a C then at least they're trying. The reason that they are trying so hard might just be because they want to play sports, and if they are trying there hardest in school so they can play sports and you take sports away from them because there grade is to low they might start not trying at all because they won't even at best be able to beat a B average.

Another reason is they aren't able to play sports because there grades are one mark to low then they won't have anywhere to get rid of energy, and that could lead to them acting out in school or at home or anywhere. If sports is the only reason they don't do drugs, and you take sports away from them, it could result to them turning to drug use or worse.

Another thing you say all ways follow your dreams to every kid and teen and don't let anyone or thing get in the way of you achieving your dream, and there dream is to be a professional athlete, and they are not able to participate in sports because they try and fall one grade short , then guess what now you're interfering with them achieving there dreams now.

Also you have i think of all the students that will not be able to participate in sport you might not have enough players on a team and not have a team at all, and be really the only school that doesn't have a sports team.

For all these reasons I think that you should not change the rule so that athletes have to have a B average to participate in sports.
