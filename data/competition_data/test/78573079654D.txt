Do you think students gets the benefits of being able to attend home school rather than distance learning?

Why to not bother nor having a question in your mind of sending you children to home school. i disagree on student's getting benefits from home school because :- they can get Anti-social, they won't be able to have Experiences and causing Damage.

First students will be Anti-social:- wont be able get to know how the society is wont be able to opened up about it not being able to have open minded risk taking not knowing how to talk in a large group of people feeling ashamed that the world not wanting them cause they are scared to try and fail feeling pushed away not knowing how to act in certain situations cause they dont know how to communicate well feeling awkward not understanding themselves instead of doing it for them selves they will leave for other not knowing themselves better than others being targeted of people using them they are more likely start to leave for people instead of themselves cause of the guilt and scared of not being wanted for being themselves instead of being themselves they choose to be a different person cause they don't want to get pushed away and of get pushed away they would rather keep themselves locked away and choose to live in someones shadow also they don't want people to distance themselves from them.

Second not having Experience:- not having experience by themselves rather than using the online resources they won't know much rather than their devices and knowledge but they won't get the feeling by being out there they won't be able to use any life lesson they used in high school for their collage year nor for the rest of their life the nature they will only live upon people expectations it might be hard for them to tell the who to the why for example they dont get a chance to be in activities, clubs, diversity, opportunities, field trip, labs, have extra time with our teachers physically special classes, etc.. not having a connection to the world feeling different emotions living with society and how to deal with it. i have a friends that goes to home school she loved it she said until she stop going home school she don't have to deal with high school drama, won't be board and more likely she won't be able to concern she will focus on thing's she have to do she won't be reckless she will do her job by her giving time but the downwards is being scared to make mistakes, being afraid, not being comparative enough, ashamed, restless her behavior start to change i ask why she told me since she stop going to home school it's a bit hard for her to communicate with people without getting offended getting her voice heard in the way she wanted it she couldn't use here experience enough to survive and she start to get depressed before it's to late we find a solution hat can help her like focusing on things she love to do to step out of her comfort zone to try new thing's to be risk taker, being open to what people have to say, knowing the difference between opinion and facts also more she is doing great know.

Third causing Damage:- sitting way to long in one position wont allow our blood to flow properly causing eye problem for staying for way to long even the brightness will have an effect on our eyes that will send strong message causing us a sharp pain in our headache i remember when there was a time that i get to be a home school student which i didnt like. my friends will come from school and i will be doing homework and assignments to catch up and it was a bit of struggle cause of the time difference that i have deal with i remember not having a time to go outside and play with them not help my parents and the got me upset sitting thee staying at my laptop heart my eyes and even my leg onetime i remember i got so sick of brightness not wanting to look at any brightness at all only darkness my head was about to blow since then i stopped going to home school not only because i was sick some of the circumstances wasnt good and it was a relief.

In Summary: Home School can be so stressful for students and parents special if the teacher is not effective enough parents and student should avoid it. Moreover, i am not saying that if you go to home school that you will end up horrible nor distance school student either also, that you are dumb there is not such a word like that it just how we manage our timing and not paying attention to things that matter the most not knowing the want and the need also u can succeed in home school but my position is with the lack of reasons it wont be effective as it is with distance high school. it's a good question to ask student what they prefer with in a survey too.
