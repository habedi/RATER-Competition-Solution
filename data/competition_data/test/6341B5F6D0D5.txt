Dear Principle,

I think that it is wrong to have at least a B average to participate in activities. If you want more students joining your clubs then it should not matter what grade they have, but by there attitude towards school. I think that they should at least have a C average and above instead of a B average, because many people try hard just to remain a C so to make a B would be more stressful for those who learn very slow at times.

We should let the students vote on what they want to do and work hard to accomplish there request. I think you are being to hard on them and would not know what kind of stress they go through to keep their grades up. Many people probably study a lot of times but they still don't make a better grade, because some people minds are just like that and you cant put that against them for working really hard to have the grade that they have right now. You should at least let them participate in school activities if they choose to no matter what kind of grade they have. At least they are trying to come together and make our school a better place for kids.

I am very angry about this because you don't know how they feel about you decision. They might even stress their selves trying to make a B average, because I have experiences right now because I'm struggling as well. If I were you I would sit down with the kids and discuss it with them what you are trying to do. Their is no hard feelings either way, because you and the kids are expressing your feelings toward your school activities and your school. If I were principle i would love to see my wonderful children participating in school activities. I have spoke what i have felt and i hope you take that in consideration. You really do have good kids at your school and I think you should put them to work if they want to join something. Thank you and have a nice day.

Sincerely,
