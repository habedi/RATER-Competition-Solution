I agree with the decision to mandate all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It allows students to discover and explore many different activities that potentially could be a career path one desires to pursue, allows for students to make new friends, and teaches students teamwork and leadership.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allow students to discover many different activities that can potentially be a career one desires to pursue. Studies indicate that 65% of students who participate in an extracurricular activity at a young age pursue an occupation that utilizes/relates to a skill pertained while participating in the extracurricular activity. Students are also exposed more to the field that their club relates with. The main reason why I want to be either a senator or a computer scientist when I grow up is that I currently participate in the Model United Nations club as well as the Computer Science club. If I hadn't participate in those two clubs, my career choices would most likely be different because I wouldn't of been exposed to that area. A student who participates in an extracurricular activity also gains more knowledge in that area of expertise which can result in that student finding a profession relating to that activity with less difficulty than a someone who hasn't been as exposed or knowledgeable.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allows students to make new friends. The main reason why a student would join an extracurricular club is because they are interested in what that specific club does. A student who joins the Computer Science club is introduced to other students who share a common interest: Computers. The majority of after school clubs meet on a weekly basis, some more than others. Nevertheless, students in an after school club would see the same students at least one time a week. This provides each and every one of the students the chance to interact with each other and befriend one another. With this in mind, joining an extra curricular activity allows students to make new friends.

The majority of extracurricular activities teach students teamwork and leadership. Students that are part of extracurricular activities that compete such as the football team or Science Olympiad must rely on each other in order to win the competition. Other clubs such as Model United Nations illustrate the importance of both as students must work with and lead other students towards resolving the conflict. No matter what club students participate in, they require an important skill: the ability to effectively and diligently work with others in order to reach a common goal. Requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity provides them the opportunity to learn teamwork and leadership; a lifelong skill.

In conclusion, I agree with the decision to make students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It allows students the chance to discover and further investigate many different many different activities which potentially could be the career path a student desires to pursue, gives the chance for students to make new friends, and teaches students teamwork and leadership. It's in the student's best interest to join an extracurricular activity because even though it requires extra time out of the student's day, It teaches lifelong skills him/her can use throughout life and makes it easier to find his/her way through life, no matter what club a student decides to participate in.
