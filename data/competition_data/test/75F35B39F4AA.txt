I think there should be no cell phones in school because that can be a very big distraction to students. That is a very bad idea. This me opinion no student is going to follow this politely these are a bunch of immature kids and will not follow this rule. Some kid will think it is all right to have cell phone in class. Kids will use the cell phone to cheat on a test get the right answerers and not pay attention in class and to distracted by the cell phone. And just because you say put the cell phone during class but you allow it during lunch or free time. They are going to take that granite and expect to have there cell phone out . And they are going to finds ways to have there cell phone and once you let them have there cell phone you can never take that back.

But in some case that could be a good thing in case of an emergence's like the school caught on fire a robber or some kind of crime.
