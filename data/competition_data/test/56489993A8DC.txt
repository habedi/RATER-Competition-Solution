Dear principal:

Many students in this school try their best in to get the best grade possible, but there is something they cant put attention to which causes them to have C grade averages. It's not fair that students with a C cant participate in school sport or activity. what could happen is the school would have more tutoring. maybe, the class assignment should be more understandable for the students. Lastly, the school should have a different grade process. I will not let the students at this school be bored and lifeless after school just because they have a C.

Students should be allowed to join a school sport or activity just because thy have a C. I think the school should have more touring. tutoring helps many people that don't understand a subject much. With tutoring, students at the school will have better grades, and lots of them will be happy because there in a activity or sport that they like. This is why students with C' s should be allowed to play in school sports or activities.

Students with C' s are not different from kids with A' s or B' s.
