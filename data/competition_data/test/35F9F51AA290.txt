PHONES AND DRIVING

Every year the world loses about 3000 to 6000 people for the use of cellphones while driving. This of course including innocent families including children,adults, and elders.

Many things cause distractions to a person behind the wheel, most of the time the distractions are caused by cellphones. Whether it is a text message , a call, GPS, or justy quickly changing the music ,in those quick little glimpses at your phone you are immediately putting at risk the life of the people around you ,including your own. Driving a vehicle of any kind takes a large amount of responsibility in many ways.

There are many people who are careful of everyone including themselves and have the responsibility and knowledge to keep their phone put away until it is safe to use it again,without putting anybody at risk. But yet there are as many if not more people who either don't care or don't think ahead of what using their cellphone while driving could do,most of these people are teens who think of it as something that doesn't have that much importance . People should not use a cellphone while driving for the simple reason that it is safer to do so,for the sake of your life and the other people around you.

The use of a cell phone while driving a vehicle could not only cause deaths it can cause a person the chance to ever walk again,write again,see ,hear,smell, or even move at all. It can leave children with no parents,family ,with no one to turn to but the government to find a new family and these children will forever live with the pain of knowing that the irresponsibility of their own or someone else caused them their lives. These tragedies do not only affect the people in the vehicle(s),it also affects their family members,friends,neighbors ,the people who were close to them are also affected ,in a great part,emotionally.

The use of cellphones while operating a car needs to stop because it is costing people their lives and chances at many things in life. Not only teens but adults make this mistake as well.
