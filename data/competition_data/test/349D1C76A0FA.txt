Many people in today's society claim that technology has become the new learning source for teenagers across the globe. Over the past couple of years, the uprising of technology has increased by over twenty percent. With this being stated, schools across the country have offered distance learning as an option for students to attend class without actually having to be in a classroom. This new technique includes video conferencing which allows people to listen in on a teacher's lesson, and online video chatting which allows the student to communicate with an instructor face to face. The new age of technology has quickly overtaken the traditional standpoint of how students should be instructed. These new online suggestions prevent a student's one on one help from a teacher, take away the ability to work with others, and prevent them from a hands on learning experience.

One on one help is a key factor to help maintain a student's success rate within the classroom. One on one help gives any student the opportunity to ask an instructor for individual help on any given test, quiz, or assignment. This also encourages the student to receive teacher feedback on how to improve their work ethic, thought process, and learning capabilities. One on one help is a traditional learning skill that has been in effect for over many decades. This resource is used by millions of people each and everyday and beneficial to people outside of school buildings. This can include jobs, businesses, and local pharmacies. It's always important that a student is aware of his/her capabilities so that they know what to improve on and how to achieve it. When a student becomes successful at this objective, students should then be at a comfort level where they should be asking their teachers questions and tips on how to be successful

In addition to one on one help, students also rely on the ability of working with others. Working with others is a major role in the development of teenage growth and maturity levels when in the classroom. This gives the students the time to come together and encourage one another's idea and thought process. Teamwork is a good social skill to obtain while in school because it will eventually carry out into life outside of school, like in the work force. In research shown, working in a group relieves stress, opens the mind to new ideas, and increases the chances of making new friends by ten percent. Group activities define character, display social skills, and show the importance of being able to cooperate with others.

Hands on learning is the most essential skill in the traditional style of learning. Even some of the most famous athletes in the world benefit from hands on learning, such as Lamar Jackson, Michael Vick, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James. Hands on learning experiences give the student an opportunity to correct his/her mistakes, learn from others, and bounce back from adversity. This is an essential life lesson that a person can only learn by attending school. Without hands on experience, students will never understand the mentality and proper mindset it takes in order to become a successful student. While in school, students should be accustomed to their own experience when trying new things and be at the point where they are comfortable working independently.

Students all over the world have their own unique style of learning. Some feel technological standpoints are better while others believe the traditional style is better. Both can be efficient in their own way. Personally, the traditional style has my vote because of the many processes that have paved the way for me. Although online or video conferencing from at home sounds interesting, I feel that being at school and getting the help needed from the teacher in person will always be more beneficial.

As shown in research, working with others increased the chances of making friends by ten percent. With the continued use of these traditional learning skills, students will continue to succeed in school, get accepted into many colleges, and receive many job offers.
