Friday March 10th, 2020 was another boring old, gross day for Generic_Name at school. All Generic_Name could think about that day was going home and playing Madden 20, and seeing the new golden ticket promo. When the bell rang in his 7th period class he new it was the end of the day and time for him to go home for the weekend , Generic_Name yelled "Yes,

I can finally go home." He yelled it so loud that the hole class turned around and looked at him like he was crazy. But when he was exiting the class his principle came on the over head speakers with a message " Good after noon, all staff and students I have a special message for all students, this school year all of you will have to participate in an after school activity, for example you could play a sport or work on the year book. I hope you all have a good weekend and I will look forward to seeing you next week." When Generic_Name got the news this he was mad, because he was not interested in any of the clubs or sports the school had to offer. So, he went to Principle Generic_Name's office to talk about the news, that he had got about the extracurricular activity. Generic_Name said to Generic_Name " Hey, is there anyway that I could not do this activity" Generic_Name said "No" Generic_Name said "What if i give you some reasons that we should not have to do this activity?" Generic_Name Said "OK go on, I want to here them." I disagree that students should have to participate in a extracurricular activities because they may not be interested in the activities, they may not have the money to pay for sporting equipment, and less time to spend with there family .

The first reason I disagree with students having to participate in extracurricular activities is because, they might not be interested in any of the activities. Some students at school like sports, that why school's have sports teams such as Basketball, Baseball, Football, and Soccer. These teams are optional and you have to tryout for them. School's also have robotics teams, Dance teams, and cheer teams. But some students at school have no friends at school ,and that is why they dont want to do these activities, because they dont know anyone there and they fell like they are going to get bullied for having no friends. But then some students are just not interested in the activities. That is why we should not make children do things that they dont want to do.

The second reason that I disagree with students having to participate in extracurricular activities is because, they might not have the money to pay for sports equipment. Playing a professional sport is every kids dream, some children are able to make it to the pro's when they are older but most of them stop playing the sport at a young age. The reason that these kids stop playing is because they can not support them self anymore for the equipment need or there parents cant afford to pay for the equipment anymore. That is one of the big reasons that children stop playing sports. The sport that this happens in the most is baseball because the equipment gets more expensive as you get older you need longer bats, bigger cleats, bigger gloves, bigger pants, Just bigger every. And you have to pay more money to play. That is why I think kids should not be forced to play a sport at school because of money issues.

The final reason that I disagree with students having to participate in extracurricular activities is because, the student would have less time to spend with there family. A lot of people like to spend time with there family, so If you were on one of the sports team you would have to go home two hours later every day because of practice. You would have less family time. And then you would have to go home and do home work, and all of the other stuff you have to take care of when you get home. The only chance you have to speed family is probably a family dinner. Most families like spending time together that is why people would not like if we had to do a extracurricular active because of less time to spend with your family.

"See Generic_Name don't think we should just be kids and not have to stay after school to do something we dont want to do" Generic_Name said ''Yeah but we have all of these clubs and no one wants to do them that is why I made that announcement" '' But you are right you guys are just kids we should not force you to do something that you dont want go do" Generic_Name said. "So on Monday when you guys come back to school I will make another announcement saying the clubs are optional you are not required to do one anymore" Generic_Name said." Thank you so much Generic_Name" Generic_Name said. Generic_Name left Generic_Name's Office with a big smile on his face Because he does not have to do a activity anymore and he can go home for the nice long weekend and play some Madden 20 with his friend's
