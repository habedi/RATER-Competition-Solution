With so much technology already being developed for the analysis of human tendencies, what could one more hurt? Nowadays, manufacturers and creators of products are using technologies and algorithims to analyze everything from shopping preferances, to the economic strengths and weaknesses that characterize a specific a consumer. Not to mention, with facial recognition, and widespread survelliance, complex human interactions are beginnning to be broken down into code. While some may argue against this simply because the idea of being "watched" does not appeal to them, these advancements have real-world applications that could actually be quite beneficial to society as a whole. The concept of the FACS program being implemented in classrooms is a concept that really should be taken into heavy consideration. The practical applications of something such as an emotional analysis program within schools, have no end. For this reason, it is concievable that the FACS program should be introduced into the fabric of the modern schooling system.

Imagine if a computer was able to comprehensively custom-tailor lessons for struggling students, based solely on their unconscious reactions to other lessons. Often times this is exactly what a student needs, and what many student activist groups have been proposing for years. The notion that a student could have a lesson that was customized to fit his or her personality, might be exactly what some parents of stuggling (and academically adept) students have been craving. In the article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, by Nick D'Alto, it is stated that, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This is a compelling argument for a fairly simple reason; most students that do not do well in school, claim that it is because they do not enjoy it, or that they do not appreciate the way that information is conveyed to them. However, this can be remedied. The implementation of the FACS program within schools would provide an alternitave to traditional teaching, and could improve the overall experience of students. Besides that, the FACS program could also be used to analyze the general student reaction to a specific topic or concept. This would provide teachers with more insight into the lives and emotions of their students, and allow them to better prepare lectures, and their coverage of that topic. The article also states that, " Most human communictation is nonverbal, including emotional communication." Not only would the gathered information be beneficial to other parties for the betterment of schooling, but it would also allow school systems to pick up on particular emotional cues that may only be visible to someone who is emotionally close to a particular student.

This program, without a doubt, offers many helpful options when it comes to its use within school systems. The FACS system should be implemented into the fabric of modern schooling. With so many applications, It would be foolish not to at least experiment with it in a school setting. While it is true that privacy and reliability are great concerns for many people, convenience and better academics are also great concerns in today's modern society. In a culture that is beginning to value knowledge over all else, it is important for schools to employ every method available to them, to better prepare students for the life ahead of them. Technology should not be viewed as an enemy in an academic world. Rather, it should be percieved as a tool. A tool that gives humanity the ability to accomplish whatever can be dreamed, and gives it the resources necessary to lead its people into a golden era of knowledge and education.
