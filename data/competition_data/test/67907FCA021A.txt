First, doing an extracurricular activity can help you learn new games you've never played. You can learn to play basket ball. You can learn new subjects. You can read books and know learn interesting facts about animals. And you can learn to play a clarinet.

Next, you make new friends and collaborate with different people you never knew. You can talk to young or older kids. You can ask questions to know someone better. You can hangout with new people to see what you both like to do. And you can do the same activities together .
