Physically going to school does not work for everyone. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Online school helps students who are unable to attend school everyday and students who have trouble focusing in loud, busy classrooms to better their education and learn in a way that is comfortable and that works for them.

Students with chronic illnesses and weak immune systems are more susceptible to miss school. There are occasions where they physically cannot go to school and they suffer because of that. Distance learning provides a source for those students to learn everyday without having to attend school. It ensures they don't fall behind and helps them learn what they are required to learn.

Online school provides a calmer environment for students who have trouble concentrating in noisy classrooms. They are able to learn without the distractions of an everyday classroom and are not bothered by any peers. They can focus completely on their work, they are even able to have one on one calls with their teacher to make sure they really understand the material.

Overall, distance learning is very beneficial to students. It is a helpful way for students to get the education they need in a way that works for them.
