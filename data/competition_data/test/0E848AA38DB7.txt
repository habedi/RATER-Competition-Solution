Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think you should make the policy change because many students are a grade C average and many of those students want to get involve in sports and they won't be able to do sports because they are a grade C average. I think you should make a policy requiring students having grades C and above to participate in sports.

Most of the students will not feel happy if you change the policy because they won't be able to participate in any sport. So I think that changing the policy isn't a good idea. TEACHER_NAME please don't change the policy because i won't be very happy and i won't be able to participate in sports niether. Remember many of the students are interested in sports and are mostly grade C average. If you change the policy there won't be a lot of students involve in sports because there is more grade C students.

So i think it would be a good idea if you would change the policy so that students from grade C and above could participate in sports that way there would be basketball teams,Soccer Teams,And Other sport teams. Most of the students would be happy if you would make this policy.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
