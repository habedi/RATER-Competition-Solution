Dear, principal

The principal should go with policy one for many reasons. One of those reason is because in case of an emergency or your mom need to call you because something happened to you. Also the other reason the principal should go with policy one because if the students have free time with there phone they would not have to use it in class.

If there was a fire in the school and the students needed to call there mom or dad right away and there was a no phone policy in school then they would have no phone to call there parents. Also if the parents are trying to reach them for something very important ,and the school has a no phone policy rule in school then there parents would have not reached them and they would have missed the emergency call.

The other reason is because if the student have the free time with there phone for 20 through 30 minutes on there phone then they will use out there phone, and there phone will run out of battery so they can not use it in class or it would not go off. also if the phones do go at class the teacher could just take it, and give it back when class ends.

Those are all the reasons that the principal should go with policy number one.
