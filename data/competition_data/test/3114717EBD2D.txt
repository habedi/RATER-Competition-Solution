The author explains how studying venus can be a good thing but also very dangerous. Do to human curiosity we will most likely one day discover and possibly live on venus!

The author tells readers how NASA is working to make a " Blimp like vehicle"

that would hover above about 30 miles above the surface. This would be good to stay out of the way of the rough ground and keep tempuatures around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Also the author explains in paragraph 4 how it was most likely just like Earth many years ago and could be possible for people to live on one day again in the near future. The author also explains in paragraph 6 that with the technoligy that we have today we would have to stay above the surface and would have to use photgraphs to show what the ground looks like from a far distance.

The author explains that NASA should spend more time making a space ship or a land cruiser that is able to withstand the heat and pressure from Venus. I think that the author has a good point in trying to find out what this planet is like, because one day it can and will be lived on. The author states that Venus is Earths "twin". By the author stating that, it makes me and others think that it can be used just like Eath. Some have to understand that Venus needs to have many changes before humans can live there and there is a great group of people working on that right now.

Thanks to human curiosity and to NASA one day hopefully in the near future venus can and will be a used planet. We as a whole should expand where we travel to explore new places that can be used instead of all cramping up here on Earth.
