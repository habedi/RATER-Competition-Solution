In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author makes a strong point to argue that observing venus is worth taking a risk for. He backs up his claim as well, ranging from strives in science, to just the insight itself.

The author states many strong reasons for his claim. To start off, one of the reasons the author gives for a observitory visit to Venus is because it, "Can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit." This shows that he is trying to back up his original claim with the fact that its perhaps the closest option we have for these visits. Also the author strides to say that it will give more knowlage on Venus if we study it. "Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet (paragrpah 8)." This also backs up what he is saying because the fact that more can be learned from Venus alone, is a huge reason for some to go observe this planet.

In conclusion, the author makes a point to say a observitory visit to Venus would be behnificial and supports his claim very well using facts and explaining what and why some of his reasons should be taken seriously. Therefore, the author did a great job in backing up his claims and explaining them thuroghly.
