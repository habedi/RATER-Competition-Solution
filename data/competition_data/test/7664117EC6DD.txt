Dear Mr. Principal,

I think all students should be required to perform community service. community services should help to teach them responsibility and show them how good it feels inside when you were able to help someone.

Community services can help all students learn responsibility by helping out or taking care of others. For example, if a student had to help out at an animal shelter, they would learn how to take care of animals and the responsibility that comes with it so that when they get their own pet they would know how to take care of it. And if their pet ever gets sick they would know what to do to help that animal.

Spending time on community services can also give you the joy of helping out . I remember a time when i was helping my little cousin with his math homework, and i helped him understand how to do the problems he was so excited he couldn't wait until his mom came home so he could show her that he understood them. It wasn't community service but i loved the feeling of being able to help him understand so he could get better at it and possibly grow up to do something with his life involving the subject that I helped him with.

Sincerely,
