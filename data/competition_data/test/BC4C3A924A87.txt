Cars are one of the leading causes of polution and smog in the world. In Paris the smog got so bad cars with even numbered plates could only drive certian days and viceversaÂ  with the odd numbered plates. Not only is it a good idea to stop because of of the green house gases but it is also good to stop becould it would stop trafic. 67% of all cars in france are desil so they were blamed for the smog over the gasoline.
