Dear Principal,

Me personally, I think you should allow phones in school. The reason I say this is because sometimes there might be an emergency and you need to call your parents. But the only thing, is that students might text answers to a friend while taking a test. I think that the teacher(s) should take the phones away at the beginning of class and then at the end of class, return them to the students. The only time they should have their phones is at lunch, or during any break that they have during school. If you disapprove, then a lot of students are going to bring their cell phones anyways and just hide their phones in their pockets and use them secretly.

A lot of kids use their phones to text. Sometimes they use them during school hours to text other friends in different schools that are allowed to bring their phones, but they'll do it secretly. Some people use their phones just to call, not text. But at school, they should only have them at lunch break, and after school. But at one point they shouldn't have their phones because they might cheat, or it might disturb them while the teacher is a talking about something important. Their phones might ring in class and the sound of the vibration might disturb others.

I support both reasons. One, is because with cell phones you call make emergency calls to parents or your legal guardian if you forgot something at home and see if they can bring it to you. Reason two, is because if your phones rings in class, you'll disturb not one, but many people, because some students want to learn and listening to what the teacher is saying. But I mostly support the bring phones policy even though they might do something bad, like cheat for example.

The truth is, a lot of students will cheat with their in tact. But it's on their education, they need to learn from their acts. If they want to learn that perfectly fine, but if they want to mess around and NOT pay attention in class, that's their fault. Not the teachers. The teachers are there to help you with your education, and if you don't want to pay attention, fine, don't, your hurting yourself and your education.

I fully support bring phones to school. But it's your choice if you want to allow students to bring their phones because your the principal and its your choice whether or not. But I'm just saying that you should allow phones at school, for emergency purposes only.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
