Although you have made good points concerning the landform on Mars, I would like to respectfuly disagree on your opinion that aliens are responsible for the bulilding of Cydonia.

In the passage, "Unmasking the Face on Mars", the author has quotes comparing the face, Cydonia, to natrual landforms on earth such as moutains and messas. Through the passage and its comparrisons, we can infer that the "face" on Mars is, in face, just made up of natrual causes and the impact of the weather. If you really think and dig deeper, the picture of the face could resemble moutains or small hills posted, or positioned, relativly close together so that the image of a face is possible.

Lastly, the reason as to why Cydonia is in fact just a landform is the way that the author writes the passage. NASA very briefly mentions the possible outcome of aliens, but other than that nothing else has been said about the "could be" creatures. They must not be firm believers. Which leads me to the conclusion that is, if NASA had discovered aliens wouldn't that make them most popular? The discovery of new life would, without a doubt, be absolutly fantastic for NASA and its image. The thought that there might be life on Mars is a good enough situatiion to lie and say that you did find life only to have your buisness in the tabloids. We can all infer that is if NASA had discovered that Cydonia had been built by aliens American citizens would be the first to know. You cant hide something like this that would make your buisness so sucsessful.

In conclusion, we can infer that Cydonia is, in fact, a landform of some sort on the face of Mars. We know this through the discussion that landforms are built with natrual causes, not aliens, and that if the face were to be built by aliens it wouldn't be hidden from citizens knowing that the discovery could boom multiple buisnesses.
