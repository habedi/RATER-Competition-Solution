Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All of the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a week or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would make no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.

If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would make it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and make it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would make the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on break he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would make it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during break. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to make the students think and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer break. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?

When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers know much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student canÂ do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to post-pone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.

Via post-poning the entire design of the project, students would think that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manor. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, like phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and know how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.

Finally students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to make it too easy, post pone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well.
