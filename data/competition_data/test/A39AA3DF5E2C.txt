what do you think about smartphones? Smartphones make it easy for us to be connected with friends and family through phone calls, text messages, etc. How do you feel about the use of cellphones while driving? Well, about 660,000 drivers attempt using a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Rates for cell phone distractions are extremely high. Do you think that it would be okay to use cellphones while driving? I feel that people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it affects their ability to drive, causes car accidents and people die.

People's driving could easily be affected by the use of a cell phone. It can be a distraction physically and cognitively. The physical distraction occurs when they are using the cellphone while driving their vehicle. Cognitive distraction occurs when drivers give their attention to the phone instead of the road. However, the ability to give your attention to both of these tasks are limited.

Statistics show that driving and using a cellphone is more common for which can be very dangerous. According to "National Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes each year. 341,000 involved text messaging, and 1.2 million involed drivers talking on the phone. The statistics show that this multitasking while operating a vehicle is becoming life threatening. Research from "Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)"

says, teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any throwbacks. If they don't use their phones they would be able to pay attention to driving, be less likely to have a crash, most importantly, they would be following the law.

Car crashes end up causing very fatal injuries and death. Driving while texting is 6 times more likely to cause car crashes than driving while intoxicated. There are nearly 390,000 injuries caused by texting and driving yearly. Approximately 6,000 people were killed by texting and driving in the past year. Checking a text takes 5 seconds of a driver's attention away from driving when they could be used on the road.

Overall, I feel that using a cellphone while driving shouldn't be allowed because it causes car accidents affects driving and kills people. 1.6 million car accidents, 1 out of 4 of them yearly involves texting while driving. This could be changed. Limit your cellphone use. Just think how many lives can be saved. Think of the car crash rate, they will dwindle. Before driving and after check your phone. You'll be focused on the road instead of fidgeting with a cellphone.
