During school many students find the school work to be hard and lengthy. Projects with certain points that need to be made and completed by certain times frames. A lot of projects are simple and straight to the point, making them all the same old boring presentations. Every student has something unique about them, this is known. They like so show how they are in thoughtful projects and writings. Schools requiring summer projects isn't a bad thing, some students need this to keep their mind flowing with creativity and objectives. But they should be able to design it however they want so it's their own mind work and material. it's easier for some to do projects when it's something they came up with. There is a higher sense of accomplishment when everything you envisioned comes together perfectly. More pride to say, "yeah, I came up with all of this and did a great job." Having students come up with their own design is a good way to get them ready for more projects like this during the actual school year.

There is no lie in the fact that during the summer everybody is laid back and relaxing, school not a thought in mind. But, it is also not a lie to say that nobody remembers a single thing from the year before, most of us at least. It's easy to forget something when it hasn't been scanned through your mind for three months. A project designed by a teacher could be a more efficient way for the student to get all their juices flowing again. But what is the fun in that? A project designed by students could be a better way for the student to get their mind working again simply because they are doing it on their own. Finding information, collecting data, reading up on certain topics. All of that being done by a students makes it harder, yes, but also gets them ready for other projects that could end up like that. School has never been a walk in the park for some, and do having to come up with an idea on their own could be a little frustrating and over the top. But school isn't always going to have an easy route so doing hard work by yourself is a good way to get you ready for the hard college years.

A student designed project is a way for the student to get their own ideas out and about. To show that they could still pull off an amazing project even after being out of school for so long. There isn't anything wrong with a teacher coming up with everything, besides the fact that it halts any kind of creativity the students could produce on their own. Common projects are simple, and most teachers want simple, clean cut projects. Ones that get straight to the point. But that has always been boring to naturally artistic students who love to show who they are in projects. You wouldn't give an artist a coloring book and tell them to paint carefully inside the lines, that way doesn't show who they are or what they can do. Giving students a empty slate to do whatever they want is a natural way for them to express themselves. Having fun so it doesn't seem like they are doing that much work.

As stated, their is really nothing wrong with teacher designed projects. But there is a feeling of that it won't mean much since it's has no other kind of creativity in it. Only what the teacher asked for, no extra power behind it to really show off. Students need an extra boost to show who they are and a project that was made with everything by a student is a very good way to start off any school year.
