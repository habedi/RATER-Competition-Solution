Dear principle,

I say you shouldn't go with the new policy. What if the students with the low grades try all they can to bring up there grades for the basketball team and it never comes up to expectations? The student has skill its just their grades. Most students have a low grade and do exceptional on a basketball team. Also, letting a low grade student on the school sports team can help with their academic growth. The coach could be like a mentor and give the student helpful advice and tips on how they could bring up there grades.

I know you're thinking if i put the c grading kid on the team then that would make me look bad. No it is actually a better chance for the student to settle down and pay attention in what he/she is suppose to be doing in class. Like you said many students have a c in their classes. I can almost guarantee that if you let the student join a school sports team, his/her grades will definitely improve. Those same ones that have a c in a class or two in a few years those are the ones in the NBA and NFL. Some of those kids will grow up an become a billion air and know how to manage their money in a correct manor.

It's your choice. Let the people with the b in there classes play on a sports team. Just somewhere in your mind think about how the kids with a c in a couple classes. Let them join the sports team and watch how there grades will improve.

sincerely,
