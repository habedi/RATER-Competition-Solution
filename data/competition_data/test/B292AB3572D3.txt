Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that all students should be required to do community service. This would teach people to give back. I know many students that do community service and think that it is really great. For the students that don't agree with it, I think this would be a rude awaking to them and would show that there are other people that need help.

My friend OTHER_NAME loves to do community service. Every Monday and Wednesday, she goes to The Ronald McDonald House and helps out. She told me she likes doing this because it makes her feel better and she loves to help people. It inspires her to do her best in everything she does. I also do community service at the local food pantry. It helps me see that I am fortunate to have all that I do. Some people come in when they have nothing left and would be dead without the pantry. Every Saturday we have a free meal available for anybody. I think this would be a great way to show some of the reluctant students what community service can be.

Having kids come help at the meal would show them how rewarding it can be to help others. Seeing these people come in with nothing would show them that community service is a great thing. Another way they could be introduced would be by having them tutor younger kids. This would show them the difficulty that some students have. They would realize that it was great to do community service when they saw the younger child face light up with a proud understanding. Also, if we are busy with community service, this would reduce the chance that we do drugs or anything dangerous like it.

Please consider this letter when you make your decision on whether to make community service required. I know that it would help some teens while they help others!
