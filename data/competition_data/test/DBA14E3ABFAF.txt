A with less cars would be a better world because people would not emit as much harmful gas to distroy the o-zone. the two reasons the world would be better without cars are people would walk more which means that people would get more exersice. the other reason that it would be better to have a world with less cars is people would spend less money on cars and gas.

The first reason it would be a better world without cars is that people would walk more and the people that walk would get more exersice and be healthier. the other reason it would be better to walk is that people that have anger and stress problems would not have to be stuck in traffic and would not get angry over people doing stuff to them wen they'er in traffic and people who get stressed would not have to worry about people running into them or people cutting them off. the last reason that it would be better for people to walk is that people would be healthier because they would not have all the fumes from the cars in thier face and would not be inhaling it so they not have lung problems in the futer because they were breathing the fumes.

The second reason it would be better world with out cars is that people would spend less money on gas which means that people wuld have more money for other things. also if people didn't spend money on gas and cars is people would not have to make car payments so they wouldn't stress about not having enough money to pay the car payment or the car getting reposesed. the last reason it would be better to not spend money on cars and gas is if people didn't spend money on that stuff they would be able to spend money on running shoes so when they walk to work or whereever they are going they can wear the proper shoes.

In a world with less cars people would be so much better off because of all the things they don't have to spend money on. also the world would not get as damaged because of all the things cars emit.
