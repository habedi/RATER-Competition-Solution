Seagoing What?

Well if you think that the Seagoing Cowboys is bad well, let me tell you about it! See the Seagoing Cowboys program is that 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA.UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke Don signed up!

In Augest 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. It took about two weeks for them to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to gt to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for just a small-town boy. In the Seagoing Cowboys, you can go on avdentures and visit many unique places. I know in your opinion that its a lot of work but you need work to get things and go to places that you want to go. So thats all i have to say. I hoped that you liked my essay!
