Did you know some schools make you do summer project? Summer projects are to assure they continue learning over their break. I believe summer projects should be designed because it's easier for students , can tell them exactly what to do, easier to grade.

Many people believe that it should be student designed. But I believe that it should be teacher designed because it's easier for students. For example, the student might want to do something really fancy but not everyone can come up with something like that. So it would just be easier for them that they just have to do a power point. The students would be able to come up with their own creativity throughout what they do.

My next reason is that you can tell them exactly what to do as the teacher. For example, you could say I want you to have 10 slides and on each slide you have to have a picture of what you are explaining. This would help the kids out because then they wouldn't be stressing and over thinking what they have to do. Also it would help you from getting crazy papers.

My last reason is that it would be easier to grade. For example, the teacher would already know what to expect and wouldn't have to do something different for every one since they would be different ideas. It would make the grading easier because they would have the same format but they would have different sentences. Also would help them out because teacher don't really feel like grading.

In conclusion, I strongly encourage you to agree with me on it being teacher designed. I believe that it should be teacher designed because its easier for the students,can tell them exactly what to do,easier to grade.Â
