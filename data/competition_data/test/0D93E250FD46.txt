Driverless cars shouldnt be a option or even a car to use. Technology can fail which isnt worth risking lives over. Even though the google car has driven more than half a million miles without a crash something can fail. These cars use post estimating sensors to control the vehicle. Imagine if one of these sensors got damaged and caused the car to go out of control. The cars seats also vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into a object. How does that give enough time to the driver to realize what is going on. And what danger the drive is in.

Car entertainment can also distract the driver if the driver has to take over. Anyting can happen why should we trust technology with our lives. People also can get blamed if their car gets in a accident when that person was technically not driving the car. So who would be liable if the car did get into a crash? Its not logical to think that a car has a better reacion time than a real human being. A human can see what is going on before his or her gets in a crash. But now its the car that isresponsible for always being aware. Have these cars been tested on different terrains? People can drive anywhere but if its in a different place with no signal how would you drive the car? im sure the car would need signal o drive. Some places that could shut down and you wouldnt be able to drive the car.
