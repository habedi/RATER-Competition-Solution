Dear Principal,

You should change the B average to at least a C average, so student can least participate in the school activities or sports. Mostly a lot of students have a C average cause its a average that means you pass your class. A lot of students don't have a B average and they like to participate in sports and they cant cause they might not have the right average to be in them. many students might stop doing good in school because they going to say that why is the whole point of trying to pass your class of you cant participate in any activities or sports in school and that is bad. So you might change it to a C average so more students can participate in the sport or activities that the school has. Also most of the time students with a A or B average don't like playing sports or participating in them cause they to busy studying and i know that cause i see them, but the C average students mostly participate in the sports. Also if you change the policy there a chance that the students with a B average might go to a B average. So I'm saying to change the school policy into a least a C average so more student can participate in the activities the school gives.
