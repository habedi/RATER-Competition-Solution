Dear Principal,

I think you should do a mixture between policy 1 and 2. I think you should do this because parents like there students to be able to access them after school or at lunch. Although the problem with allowing students to use it at free times and lunch is some people may be texting then after the passing period or whatever it was they may continue texting and want to reply to messages in class which can get them in trouble or become distracted making it difficult to learn. So if you could allow students to bring there cell phones but make them keep it in there lockers until the last bell rings and then they can contact there parents or whoever. cell phones have become a important aspect of student community. most people have them and not all of them are gong to obey the rules of not being able to bring the, for sure people will bring them and some people will even use them regardless the rules. the only way that would actually make everyone obey the rule would be to give both students and teachers the option to bring there phone and use it anytime they would like as long as it is on silent so it wouldn't be distracting to the other students in the class also it would have to be on the desk so the teacher could see if the student is using to cheat if they suspect something. the teacher would also have to take the phone during any tests or quizzes.

Sincerely,
