I strongly believe that students should be able to participate in sports or other activities weather they have a B average or not. I believe this because most students put in the effort but still get bad grades, some activities wouldn't have enough people because most students have a C average, and it helps students get their grades up if they could participate in activities.

Students try hard to get good grades. They study, take notes, listen in class, but they still don't get very good grades. Instead, they would be better in effort. Students should be allowed to participate in activities if they put in good effort. Some kids wouldn't try to get good grades but get them anyway. They don't participate in class, or take notes, but they would still get good grades by doing their homework and getting good grades on tests.

If only A and B students got to participate in activities, then there wouldn't be enough people in the activity. If there were only A and B students on a basketball team, there wouldn't be enough people on the team to play unless most A and B students were more interested in that sport than any other activity.
