Dear Principal,

I say students do not need a B average to participate in sports. Many students i know have a C average, sometimes a B average. Every day, students need something to look forward to, help them and help them stay fit. To take away someone's pursuit of happiness is against the constitution. I declare that it is not right to take away sports from C average students!

Students need something to look forward to everyday. If I had nothing to look forward to everyday I would be depressed. Many of my friends who are in sports, look forward to after school sports. They look forward to games, practices and seeing their friends everyday. Even if they were to join a school sport and had no friends in that sport, they could make friends. I am not a very social person, so i don't really have anything to look forward to at school, other than friends. Athletes usually like or love the sport they play or else they wouldn't be playing it. Even if a person weren't getting a B average, they would only have a little bit to look forward to. Plus, having a C average motivates them to at least try hard. Never have I ever met someone who didn't like the sport they played.

Sports help people. A good alternative to drugs and alcohol is sports. If you were to take away school sports, I bet there would be a incline of drugs and alcohol at school. Making and keeping friends is a great life skill. Raise the average grade up to a B and ou will be taking that away. Sports can also become relaxing. I learned that doing exercise releases a chemical in your brain that makes you feel happy. So having a school sport, say if they were almost at a D average instead of a C, they would play, realize, then work harder at school. B averages are sometimes hard to reach, like if there is fighting at home. C is an overall average for a reason. To relax, athletes focus on sports. Relaxing inspires them to do better in everything. Another thing about sports is they prevent suicide and such. If a students parents were fighting, they might not know what to do. But, if a athletes parents were fighting, he or she could go outside and start playing a sport.

One thing over the years in America that has happened is that there is an obesity problem. So if we keep school sports open to those who have a C average, we will also be reducing the obesity level in our schools. Staying fit is very important. If someone really loved a school sport, and you raised the average up to a B, and they had a C, they would be crushed. Not only would they be crushed, they would be stressed. Stress leads to eating, sleeping, and school problems. Then all that junk leads to other things. Obesity is one of those things. I know I get stressed out really easy and sometimes i just want to run around, but at my house there is no place for me to run around. Many students have no place to run around when they don't feel right. Give them that chance!

Keep sports grade averages at a C!

B averages mean above average for one thing, and a C means average. Being average is ok, it may inspire people to be better. One day, everyone will learn how much they love a certain sport and there will be less stress, something to look forward to everyday, and help with the weight problem in America. Stay at a C average! Thanks for your time.
