Dear Principal,

Cell phones at school are constantly being debated.

Everyone has different opinions about what should be done.

We all know that cell phones can be distracting, but what if we allow students to have their cell phones at school and use them during lunch?

I think that's a great idea.

Students should be allowed to use their cell phones during school as long as they aren't using them in class.

There would be no harm in allowing the students to use their cell phones while they aren't in class.

If a student is using a cell phone while they aren't in class, why should they be punished for just calling a friend?

It's not like they are getting distracted from their schoolwork because they are using their phone outside of class.

However, students should only be able to use their phone while they are outside of class.

If they are caught using their phone in class when they know full well that they shouldn't be using it, they should be punished.

However, a student should be able to do whatever he wants with his cell phone outside of class because he or she isn't distracting anyone.

Students just like to talk to their friends and they shouldn't be punished for wanting to do that.

Teenagers constantly have something they want to say to other people.

Sometimes, they just have to let their best friend know about what is happening in their life.

It would be wrong to not allow a student this opportunity especially if their not in class.

There is very little freedom to do what you want in school these days.

This is why schools need to allow cell phone use outside of class.

As I stated before, there is no harm in calling a friend while you're outside of class.

Finally, sometimes kids just like to break the rules.

They want to talk on their phones in class just so they can appear cool to their friends.

If the students are allowed to talk outside of class, they won't be driven to talk to their friends inside of class.

This is because they aren't breaking the rules anymore.

They don't seem as cool.

If students are allowed to use their phones outside of class, there won't as much cell phone distraction in class.

Students should definitely be allowed to use their cell phones outside of class.

They really want to use their phones and there is no harm in letting them do so.

It will also limit the amount of distraction in class brought on by cell phone use.

There is nothing wrong with allowing students the privilege of talking on the phone outside of class.

Sincerely,
