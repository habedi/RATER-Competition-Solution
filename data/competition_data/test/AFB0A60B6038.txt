Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My out look on the dilemma is that all students should not be required to participate in community service. I say this because some students who have extra curricular activities, would not have time for such tasks. Also, unless the service was done during school hours, other students parents ,who work late, would not have any means of transportation. There for students should have a choice on whether or not to partake in community service, for conflicts in their lives would make participating in such activity a stressful scenario. So i disagree on that part.

My other opinion on this subject would be for students with low grades or disruptive behavior in class, should be required to endure the community service. It would be a helpful alternative to ISS. They would learn not to be unseemly and to act appropriately during school in addition to a new view of appreciation for their community. This change in discipline would result in less students acting up, leaving our school with a bright out look on our future. So there for i also agree with your proposition.

So for now i am neutral to the subject at hand, i can not say i agree or disagree due to the variety of students in this fine establishment. So the choice is up to you on whether or not you decide to force stress on our students or bring them a bright hopeful future.

I hope your decision is a wise one.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
