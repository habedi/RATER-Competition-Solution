I will be giving you guys an essay of why you should join the program.

you should join the program because it is fun to ride a cattle boat. And you get good deeds if you help people. It is a big adventure. And you should join it because you do a lot of activities.

For example the text states that "The cattle boat trips were an unbielivable oppurtunity for smal-town boy. The text also states that "The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

Some people think that people shouldn't join it. They think that it is a dumb program. They even think it is not an adventure. I think they are wrong and a lot of people like Luke think that it is not dumb and that it is an adventure.

Hopefully you injoyed my essay and want to join the program to.

I gave you guys some details why you should join it. And i showed some examples of people that think you shouldn't join it. Hopefully you guys are on my side.
