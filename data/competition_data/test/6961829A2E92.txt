For some students, distance learning could be beneficial due to many personal reasons. For others, being at home presents distractions that a school environment doesn't have. I do not believe that students will benefit from the option of taking classes at home due to the fact that they won't gain social skills, they will slack off on their work, and they won't be focused on the tasks at hand.

Being at school among other teens enables young teens to develop social skills that will be very important when entering the real world. At school, you communicate, work together, and solve problems on a daily basis. When you enter the workplace, you must be able to communicate with your colleagues to solve problems and work together to complete tasks. If students are learning from home, they aren't able to gain these life skills because the only people people they will be surrounded by are family members.

Along with being isolated from their peers, students may not take their school work seriously because they are at home in their own environment. Being at home means that students can wake up and get started on their daily tasks at whatever time they desire. With this freedom, many students get lazy and lose the motivation to do their work. They will procrastinate doing their assignments until the very last minute before they are due.

Some may argue that distance learning is beneficial for students with anxiety because they will be more comfortable in their own home; however, assimilating them with other students may help them get used to the circumstances and lessen their anxiety.

Students will overall benefit the most from remaining at school. In the years you attend school, you accumulate numerous social skills and improve on them by going to school sponsored events like homecoming, football games, and being on sports teams. Being at home in your own space enables laziness and provides distractorsÂ that deter you from completing your school work.
