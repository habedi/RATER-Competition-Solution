I would have to go with policy 1 because i think that would be fair. Some people don't want to eat during lunch time. So why not use the phone or text people. Its our free time the only chance we can use it. And yes i know some student wont want to put their phones away when lunch is over but we need to understand that if you are being nice enough to let us use them then we cant take advantage of that. I really think we should be allowed.

Besides we have like two hours in each class, so we should have a chance to chill out and relax. If you allow us to use them during lunch time that would be great. Also when we are done using our phones we can put them away in our lockers. You can make sure their in our locker so we wont be distracted in class. I think you should consider it.
