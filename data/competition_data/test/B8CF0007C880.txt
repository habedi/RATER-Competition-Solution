Venus is one the brightest points of light in the night. Venus is the closest to Earth. It's even referred to as Earth's twin. Astronaunts have traveled to planets, such as the moon. They've even studied the moon in various occasions. Venus is just as close to Earth than the moon, so why not study it?

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may have once looked like Earth. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. The solution to the extreme conditions on the surface would allow scientists to float above. Solar power would be enough and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. It would not be easy for humans, but it would be survivable.

Venus is just like any other planet. It's not fully liveable, like Earth. Astronomers would have to be creative and work around conditions like these to try and study planets. NASA wanted to study Venus, so now all they have to do is work on some equipment that can handle these extreme conditions with humans. Modern technology can make studying Venus easy.

This planet isn't as dangerous as it seems. Between the harsh conditions and hot weather, it's just like any other planet. It's even like Earth. Earth gets hot, too. Earth has harsh conditions, but we live here. Why do astronomers hesitate to study Venus, then? It's close to Earth, and it once was just like Earth. Sending the right technology to Venus could help it.

Venus is sometimes called the, "Evening Star."

Venus may seem very dangerous to some, but with some simplified electronics, studying it can be possible. Venus is just another planet. It may have hot weather and very extreme conditons, but so do other planets. Therefore, we shouldn't be limited to a few planets because of dangers.
