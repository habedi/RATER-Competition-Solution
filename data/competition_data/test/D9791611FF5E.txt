Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, alothough it will be a challange. I claim that the author does a good job of supporting this idea. Studying Venus would be benfafitial because it allows us humans to understand more about the closest planet to earth. It would also be benfaftial because it is often referred as Earth's "twin". Studying Venus will not be easy due to the planet having the hottest surface in the solar system.

Studying one of the closest planet's to Earth would be benfafital to us humans because it gives us more knowaldge about it. In paragraph 2 it states " Earth, Venus, and Mars our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at differnt speeds. These differences in speed mean that somtimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."

Another quote from paragraph 2 would be "Because Venus is right around the coner--in space terms- humans have sent numerous spaceraft to land on this could-draped world. Both of these quotes show that Venus is benfaftial to study because it does not take long to get information about the planet becasue it is close to earth.

Venus is often referred to as "Earth's "twin", which is also another reason why the author used to to support his claim. In paragraph 2 the auhtor states " Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size." In paragraph 4 it states "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Another quote from the passage that supports this idea is in paragraph 4 "Today, Venus still has some features that are analogus to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains and creaters. All of these quotes prove that studying Venus is very benfaftial because it is very smilar in some ways to earth than any other planet in our solar system.

Although studying Venus will indeed be benfaftial, it will not be easy due to the planet with the hottest surface tempture in the solor system. In paragraph 3 the author states " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 precent carbon dioxide blakents Venus. Another quote is in paragraph 2 " Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Paragraph 3 states " On this planet's surface, temperatures avarage over 800 degrees farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experiene on our own planet. Paragraph 3 also states " These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviornment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest part of our oceans and would liquefy many metals." All of these quotes prove that it will be a challange to study the surface of Venus, but in the end the hard work might pay off.

All of these statements prove that the author uses alot of detial througout the article to support the idea of furthuer studying the surface of Venus. It is one of the closest planets to earth, It is also referred to as Earth's "twin", but it will be a challange to study the surface due to the extreme environment that Venus has. This shows that us human's should futur out studys to keep exploring Venus.
