During the summer many learning institutions enforce mandatory summer projects over the break to assure that students continue to obtain the knowledge and essentials needed to succeed for the following school year. These summer projects should be teacher-designed opposed to student-designed. A student-design will disregard the necessary requirements and create a more fun and easy based project. Students are more likely to hold the project with minimum standards. While Teacher-design will assure that all criteria for the upcoming school year have been met, while still allowing students to enjoy their summer vacation.

A teacher- design will be held with higher standards but still keep the project simple. Students will be held accountable for actually completing the assignments correctly. A student design will have many possible errors, will not be taken seriously, and will not grasp on the important concepts that are needed to be obtained. Students are more likely to take the project more serious if their are stricter requirements and guidelines. A

Teachers are able to adjust and plan accordingly to each individuals learning pace. overall, Providing a a student with a teacher-design will help the students know what the expectations are for the next school year and prepare them efficiently during the summer break.
