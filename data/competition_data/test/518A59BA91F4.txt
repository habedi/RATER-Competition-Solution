I think it would be a good idea to try.

If kids have to get a higher grade to play sports they would do so.

They would try much harder in school because they have to so they could play sports in school. They would become much smarter and involved with school.

Most kids barely try because they don't have to because of the low grade needed to play sports.

Kids might say it isn't fair because they are already trying their hardest.

Or because they don't want to try any harder then what they are doing now.

Most of them also probably don't study for test or quizzes. If they would study they would do better no matter what. Studying could help them with any test or quiz given.

If they still continue to do bad then they should get a tutor to help them with homework and schoolwork.

Also it would help the school because then kids would have higher grades and not have low grades. It would increase test scores for classes and other test. I try my hardest all the time in school and so should everyone else because I would think they enjoy getting good grades on their report card like I do.

Also playing sports should be a privilege not something you get do because you barely try to do any school work.

That's why I think its a good idea to try.

It would make kids be more involved with their school. Even get better grades over all. They would see it is nice getting better grades then they usually get and easy to do.

More kids also would want to play sports too because they would feel its a privilege and not just something you could do.

Having to get higher grades to play sports would be a great idea
