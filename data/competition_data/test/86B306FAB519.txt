In "Challenge of the Exploring Venus" there are many dangers that it presents from weather to the conditions we will face if we ever live on our Earth's twin Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun making it extremely hot and dry the temperatures average iver 800 degress fahrenheit the amount of the highest degress can melt some of our metals making them become liquids .

The weather in Venus can be extreme from their thick atmosphere with at least 97 percent of carbon dioxide making the clouds extremely a corrosive making its rain into acid. Venuses pressure is greater than Earths pressure about 90 times more powerful the enviroment is extremely powerful where humans have never accountered this type of enviroments.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planets our solar system its pressure of heat can cause erupting valcanoes and powerful eathquakes and frequent lightnings triikes to probes seeking to land on its entire surface.

Earths space administration known as NASA has sended humans to study all over to Venus and air craft but usally they do not suceed in landing at all because Venus has different speeds if NASA do land on to the hostile and extreme condtitioned surface of Venus it would allow scientists to float above the frays making the air pressure close to the level on Earth although the radiations would not exceed to Earth levels. The conditions on Venus is extreme and hostil but Humans can still survive the bad conditions that Venus has.
