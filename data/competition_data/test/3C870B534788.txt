Dear Principle,

I believe you should be able to go and play sports if you maintain lower than a c. I believe you should because some of the teachers give us way to much homework like this one teacher she gives us a packet to do every day. Also i believe you should be able to play if you don't turn in your homework. or miss a day in practice because you are sick i really do believe if you get lower than a c grade average you should not be able to play also because some people just cant not get there grade up in science or math but its one thing if your failing a class and are trying you should be able to play if you are trying and getting help but still just don't get it.

So now you know that I believe you should be able to play in a sport if your grade is lower than an b I believe if you should be able to play no matter what the because if your grade is a c or higher. i think it should be the same.
