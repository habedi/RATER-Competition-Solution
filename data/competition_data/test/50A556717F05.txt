I know that the Face is a natural landform. I know for sure it was not made by aliens because aliens do not exist. We do not have a trace of alien lifeforms in our solar system. The Face was shaped into that form 25 years ago. We do not have proof that the Face was made by aliens. What it actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West. Even though Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it did shoot a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Mara Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. A person said " It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." Scientists say that each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters,compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. They said if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.
