No Cellphones While Driving

I think cell phones should be banned while driving. The use of cellphones while driving can cause many accidents. Most states already have a law that prohibits the use of cellphones while driving. Car accidents are the leading cause of deaths for teenagers. Another reason they should be banned is because of the rise in ones insurance.

Many beginning drivers are the ones who are most likely to text and drive. They feel like they are free and feel they look cool with their phones out while behind the wheel. Not only teenagers, but anyone can be talking on the phone and get distracted and cause an accident. The use of cellphones is the leading cause of many accidents.

Due to the high rate of accidents, insurance is very expensive. Insurance is extremely high for teenagers because they are the ones who tend to cause more accidents. Personally, I have almost hit many cars because I was distracted by a text message or a phone call. Since the economy and world is very different now, money is very tight. Let's face it, nobody wants to pay a high amount or even pay with their life just to check one message.

Not only do you have to watch for cars, but for pedestrians as well. If you are in a crowded area, or somewhere near many sidewalks, avoid your phone. Anyone can be crossing the road at anytime and since the person is not paying attention to the road, there can be a very deadly accident. Hitting a pedestrian is probably the worst thing you could do. There are now new apps on cell phones that will let others know you are on the road.

Therefore, do not text and drive. Being distracted on your phone can cause many accidents. You can hit a car, make others crash, or even worse, hit a pedestrian while they're crossing the road. Cell phones should be banned when driving.
