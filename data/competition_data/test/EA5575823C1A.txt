Have you ever wanted to explore the world? Have you ever wanted to get a fun job? Well, if you do then I believe being a seagoing cowboy would be great for you. There are so many reasons to join. So I will tell you them.

One big reason to join is that you get to explore the world. This is a job where you take animals across was to different countries. I myself visited many countries and loved it. You get to see such beatiful sights while getting paid.

Another reason is its fun. As I mentioned before you go to such wonderful places. Plus, when the ship returns from one destination the shipmate have fun completions the while time, and when you are at whatever place you are you can visit anywhere and have fun anywhere. All while being payed.

One of my favorite reasons is that you help people. Being a Seagoing Cowboy means that you help people. You give to countries in need. Not only do you help them, you also help yourself. I never realized the need of other countries before a became a Seagoing Cowboy. I just love to give other countries animals that are in need.

I hope I convinced you to become a cowboy of the sea. I think you should become one, just because it is so wonderful. I bed thee farewell with hopes that you become a Seagoing Cowboy.
