Dear=principal

I know principal you're deciding whether to force students or require them to do community service. If I were you dear principal I would require every student to at least do 30 to 60 minutes of community service. I know that's not a lot but we can take to much time of students due to that some students need time to do class work(homework)and prepare for the next day and time for resting. But it does not mean they cant help the community for just a bit.

This idea can help our community improve by the following: If we collect trash and put in the right place we can save plants, animals in danger, and bugs. Also it makes our community look awesome. Also our community wont look bad meaning it make us look like we cant take care of our community.

Also touring may not look a community service but it is students can touter kids in need. This may help us and other kids in need. Another community service can be recycling. That way we can reuse reusable items and not waste them.

I hope I've convince you dear principal and with you're approval of this act even if a short time service it may help our neighborhood.

Sincerely=STUDENT_NAME
