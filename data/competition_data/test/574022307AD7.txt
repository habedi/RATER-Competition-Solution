Dear State Senator,

I, PROPER_NAME, think that we should not abolish the electoral college! The Electoral College has been used for many years and not been a problem til now. In my opinion, people are just getting upset because the nominees they voted for didn't get elected.

"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachroninsm, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner". (paragraph 15 in source 3) It's the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Some people don't know that. Though each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is rarely betrayed. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has rarely happened.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president anyways. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

In conclusion, many people are unaware of the election rules. They don't know what they are talking about when it comes to political stuff. Therefore, you should not listen and keep the electoral college!

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
