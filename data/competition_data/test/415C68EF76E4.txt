During the summer break some students may forget all about what they've learned. Schools are requiring students to complete projects during the summer to help them keep learning. Students should be able to chose what they would like to do for their project.

Students look forward to their summer break because they dont have to do anything. Well teachers want them to continue learning during their break. If the kids were able to choose what they want to do on the project, they would actually do it unlike if the teachers chose a boring project. Kids are embellish and like to do their own thing.

Also they get a new teacher every year. Their new teacher could expect more than the old teacher or grade it differently.

If the teacher chose the project, the students might not do it because its boring or lame. If the student chose what the project is about then it's easier for the teacher to grade it and the students would enjoy it more. All the students would have different projects so it could be like a science fair and they get to judge whose project is the best.

Students through out all ages are creative. Some love to draw,write,and record. This generation is all about phones. They could make a documentary or even a YouTube video about whats going on in the world. Doing projects they get to chose may excite some students and make them want to do it. They could also do their project based off how their summer went.

Kids love to be independent and cant wait to grow up. Teachers may be hard on students and give them projects they struggle with. The students should be able to have the choice to chose, since the schools are requiring students to complete summer projects.
