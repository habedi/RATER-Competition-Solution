Everyone and their momma has a phone nowadays and its unreal. Everyone is connected to the little box in their pocket life a lifeline and that's deadly. When people look at their phone no matter what they are doing it is messing with their vision. It's dangerous because when adults are driving and cannot see they are likely to hit someone or something. Not only could they possibly kill themselves but if there is a young child walking they could have their life taken over just a simple text message.

When you add the many factors into adults driving and the dangers its imaginary. The light outside and how dark it is will be put into play, if the road is wet it'll make it slippery or even just other drivers. The life of an innocent child is much more important than any text message anyone could ever send. There are many different ways to make life easier and safer, such as Bluetooth and voice activated features. The world would most definitely be safer and much easier to live in if everyone did their part not to be distracted while they are driving.

No one wants to have to worry about having their child die by some distracted driver while they are walking but everyday kids get killed either on accident or on purpose. It happens and no one wants to admit it but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Just looking at your cell phone it takes your eyes away from the road just long enough for you to swerve and take out a little kid. No one really thinks of kids when they are driving around on the highway or a normal road but the children should always be on everyone's mind.

It is a terrible shame that the world and our ever growing economy does not care enough about our children and young adults to stay off their phone. While young adults themselves are a big part to blame for the recklessness and irresponsibly whilst driving we cannot put the blame on one group of children. Just like no one can put all the blame on adults we are all responsible for driving when we are and if anyone makes the tragic mistake of using their cellphone while it may not cause the death of them it may just very well be the cause of an unfortunate death
