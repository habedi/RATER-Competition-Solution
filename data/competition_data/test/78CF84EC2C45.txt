"Driverless cars are coming" is an article that informs the reader about cars that can drive themselves; but they also yield warnings about these autonomous cars.

The thought of driverless cars is fascinating! Since 2009, Google has had cars that could drive by themselves under specific situations. This gives the driver a whole new expirence from what has been expected for years. Yes, drivers still have to stay alert and navigate through various traffic issues, such as driveways, constuction work, accidents, etc., but driving just got a whole lot easier.

Automobiles are already on their way! In 2013, BMW announced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistance".

With this function, drivers don't have to worry about the stop and go, but they can worry more about their destination. GM has also added to the technology. They developed seats that would vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing in an object. Now drivers wont have to worry about that blind spot that alwys urks them, because GM has their back.

But don't think that this is all fun and games just because the car is driving for you. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver says this," We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."

Various manufacturers are hoping to bring in-car entertainment and different information systems that use heads-up displays.

So, overall driverless cars are becoming our future. I am completely for this idea. Those of us in the technology era have learned to adapt and this is just another way. People are coming up with new ways to make our lives easier and autonomous cars are just the beginning.
