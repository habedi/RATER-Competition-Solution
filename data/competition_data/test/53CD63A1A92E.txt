I think that the student should be able to volunteer for community service if they want to. If they don't, then they may not do work as well. When someone volunteers, they usually want to do what they're doing. If someone is more forced on doing it, they may not put in a lot of effort. Time may be lost during a school day if everyone volunteers also. People who did volunteer would have to make up the work the next day at school, because they wouldn't have time in the day for work besides the work they're already doing. But others may need to do homework so it could get in the way of education. That's another reason they should not be forced to do it. Also people may have extra curricular activities such as sports. Community service would get in the way of them having a chance for playing a sport. But an advantage of making them do it, they would meet new people while they're at it. It'd be more effective if they only did it once a week. As if they had one day to do it. So they don't miss anything in school, or miss out on sports. The coaches or instructors of the sport will be told ahead of time that they would not make practice once a week. And any homework given the day before they do community service, it should be due 2 days after it is given. So they have plenty of time to do it. But if they were not forced to go only a certain amount of people should go. If they had a class of just one person in it, then it would be weird and they probably wouldn't learn anything. They would say something like, "How come I have to learn while everyone else isn't even at school?" So if the class has say 30 people, only 15 people should be able to go volunteer. Or even 10. Both of the options have ups and downs, but letting them volunteer on their own is a better idea. Most students would hate the idea of having to go to community service, and I know I don't want to.
