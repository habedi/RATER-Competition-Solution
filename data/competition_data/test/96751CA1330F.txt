Do I think that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity? No, and these are my reasons. Some students might not always have a ride home. Maybe, they don't have time or an extracurricular activity. Or, they just don't want to.

The first reason: the students might not have a ride home. Maybe they have to ride the bus home because their parent or guardian has to work. Also, they wouldn't want to walk home if they live far away from the school. Then, some students are not close enough to other students to ask for a ride home.

The second reason: they don't have time for an exracurricular activity. The students could have a job. Maybe they have to cut grass or rake leaves. Some students have grandparents to take care of, or younger siblings.

The third and final reason: they just don't want to. I know that sounds bad, but I can back it up. Speaking from a student's perspective, I know that some people do not want to do an extracurricular activity, and I respect that. We are in school for eight hours. So, if they want to go home and do whatever, that is okay. I do extracurricular activities, I play football and basketball. But, not everyone does. Coming from me, I don't feel like they should have to.

In conclusion, those are my reasons why I don't think that every student should participate in an extracurricular activity. But, if they want to, they can do it. Its just that I dont think it should be manditory. Do you think it should be or shouldn't?
