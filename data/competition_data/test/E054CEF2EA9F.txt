Land either froms by its self, by people, or by having chunks taken out of it by meteors. The face on Mars could not have been created by a living life form, for the planet is unsafe for life. The rocks created a formation that looks like a face because of all the shadows and dust that were in the picture. Mars was hit by a lot of meteors and that is also why it looks like face. The face on Mars is most likely a volcano, a mountain, or a valley. Meteors have hit Mars so it takes some of the rocks and land away and it could happen to look like a face made aliens, but it cant be because it is a natural land formation of rocks.

Many people would disagree because they believe that Mars could have living lifeforms. Mars cant have living things on it because of the air being as toxic as it is. People think that there is a possability for things to be able to live on Mars, but there is no way for life to sustain on Mars because there is no where to grow food and raise animals to eat. There is no oxygen to breath so animals would just die because of lack of oxygen.
