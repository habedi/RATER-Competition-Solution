Many people have come to believe that there is a ''face'' on Mars.

In May 2001, a spacecraft from NASA spotted something on Mars that they thought looked like a face, but it really isn't. I agree it does look relatively like a face, but I am here to tell you the truth about what that face really is.

What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Jim Garvin said "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." If you don't know what that is, its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Clydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.(which were not very clear) Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for NASA to share the picture. As they posted the picture online, it revealed that it was clearly not a face created by aliens, it was just a landform that looked like a face.

But after NASA showed the whole world that there was no face on Mars, not everyone was satisfied. They even said that the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. And that it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on Mars. They also said that since it was such a cloudy time on Mars that the camera made a mistake because it had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Some skeptics even said that perhaps alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze.

I can assure you that those rumors may seem logical, but they are not real at all.

Our cameras did not make any mistakes and Mars "face" is just a landform. If you ever hear from anyone that Mars has a face you can tell them that it isn't real and that there are no such thing as aliens on mars nor will there ever be.
