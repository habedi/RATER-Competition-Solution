Summer break is for students to have fun and enjoy the long warm days, however, school requires for students to continue learning. The way they want you to continue your learning is by making projects. Schools want to know if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed.

In my opinion if students are going to be required to make these projects they should at least be able to be student-designed. Since it's summer, students are not going to be pleased having to make a project espescially if its teacher-designed. If students were allowed to make the project their own way they would be able to make anything that involves what is going on with their summer break. They would have also more options and ideas than if the projects were to be teacher designed. Student's would have a greater chance doing extremely better if they went based on their own creatation.

Students would maybe struggle a little because then again they are only students, so they wouldn't know if they did it right or if they have enough work done. If it were to be teacher-designed, student would have an idea of how much they would need to include. It would take longer but a student would know what the teacher is looking for and what they would consider a good grade. As a student myself i overthink a lot on the work i do on my own; i ask myself " does this look right or is it missing something?". Which leads me to try and making it better.

Overall, i would prefer if the school would allow the projects to be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. It would take less time if students had the choice to have our project made the way they think is best. Students work faster when given something to do on their own because it opens their mind up to more than one thing. Since the project is a requirement i feel as if it should be fun and made however students feel is right, this way they spend more timing doing it and getting the work done.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to have the choice to make their summer project just the way they feel is right. Teacher-designed projects don't let a students be as creative as if they made it with their own ideas.
