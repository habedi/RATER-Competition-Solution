Students all over America could benefit from having online conferencing. If students are given the option to attend classes from home, it could help students and teachers decrease their workload and stress. Also, attending classes from home can be important when students can not make it to school and it is beneficial for many other reasons too. All schools should offer students the ability to attend classes from home because it will help students keep up with their classes even if they are unable to go to school, it will help students with their understanding in a subject if they are allowed to re-watch lessons, and it will help students reduce the stress of missing class or not understanding a topic.

First, having online video conferencing or video lessons allows an absent student to remain on track with the rest of the class. For example, Generic_Name, an Algebra 2 student, misses school because he is very sick and since all the material taught by his teacher that day was posted online, Generic_Name does not fall behind in class. Because of the online lesson, Generic_Name knows what happened that day and will not have to waste his or his teacher's time to learn the lesson at school. Now, when Generic_Name returns to school he will not have to catch up with his other classmates, he can continue at the same pace as all the others'. Also, Generic_Name is going out of state for the week and will miss quite a bit of school, but when he gets back all the material he missed will be online and easily accessible. Rather than panicking about asking or emailing all his teachers, Generic_Name has all the material he needs taught the same way that it was in school. Generic_Name can now spend an afternoon or a weekend watching the videos rather than needing to teach himself the material. Being able to view online lessons can save many students who can not attend school, keeping them from falling behind and allowing them to stay on track.

Next, video lessons or online conferencing will help students with their understanding in a subject if they are allowed to re-watch the lessons. Such as, Generic_Name was having trouble understanding a recently learned topic, she could watch the lesson again and see if there was any information she missed or could clarify. Giving the ability to re-watch lessons allows students to perform extensive studying and mastery of a topic. Generic_Name can also get more accurate information rather than notes that may have been rushed or incomplete. Another example, Generic_Name was having a really bad day and could not focus well while the teacher was giving the class a lesson. The online lessons would be very beneficial in this case because Generic_Name would be able to re-watch them once he was feeling better. Doing this would allow Generic_Name to have a second chance rather than grading his work based on what he learned while he was having a bad day, giving him this second chance could drastically alter the results of a graded assignment such as a test or quiz. As you can see, giving students the ability to review in class lessons and material can have great changes in their performance and knowledge in the subject.

Lastly, giving students the option to view lessons online can greatly reduce the amount of stress on a student. An example of this is, Generic_Name missed some important information during a lesson presentation and without being able to re-watch the lesson, he beings to stress and worries that he may not be able to complete his work or even pass the test. Because of such stress, Generic_Name may begin having trouble focusing, lose sleep, and many more similar problems may occur. While if he did not have to worry about missing information as much, he would be much more relaxed and stress free. Also, Generic_Name is worried about a test coming up soon but does not have the proper notes he needs to be completely prepared for it; without the ability to review any in class lessons, this predicament gets him worried and stressed about the test causing him to go hours a day looking for usable study material. Though if he had been able to access the lessons he took in class and re-watch them, he could have written better notes and not stressed about the test as much. Having the lessons allows for all students to clear misunderstanding and reduces stress.

In conclusion having online conferencing or the ability to attend class at home gives students many opportunities and benefits. Such benefits include, allowing students to remain up to date on in class material even if the student is absent, gives students the ability to review material they may have misunderstood, and it will help students reduce the stress of missing class or falling behind the rest of the class. Some may argue that allowing online conferencing allows for too much freedom and can cause students to begin to slack off and not attend school as often. This is completely true, although it does allow students to be slightly more free and flexible, this does not mean that the online conferencing is better; in class schooling will always be better and allows for questions, as the online schooling is a backup if the student is unable to attend school or needs extra help. For these reasons, online conferencing would be a great addition to almost every high school or even college. It provides students with many more possibilities and options when it comes to an unexpected event or inconvenience.
