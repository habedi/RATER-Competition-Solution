Being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun and interesting. I would know, because I have have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times in total. It only takes about two or three days to cross the Atlantic Ocean. You get to see beatiful sites, help people, deal with animals, and play games with other Seagoing Cowboys. You also get to travel places.

On the boat, time will fly, because you will be doing something fun most of the time. You get to see beatiful sites such as: the Atlantic Ocean, Europe, China, and the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help people in need, and you can tend to animals. An example of an animal is a horse, you would have to clean them and feed them. On the way back, after the animals have been dropped off, the Seagoing Cowboys and I can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals have been. As a Seagoing Cowboy you get to travel a lot, places like: Greece, Europe, and China.

I have been a Seagoing Cowboy for a long time, and I like it a lot. You get to see beatiful sites, help people, deal with animals, and play games with other Seagoing Cowboys. You also get to travel places. It's an opportunity of a lifetime, that you don't want to miss. It's a lot of fun, and I would recommend that you try it.
