Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is not a good thing. The people should be able to determine who their president is. Not the stupid electors. It's called the people's nation for a reason. Majority rules. So whenever we have an election, which ever president gets more votes from the citizens of the United States of America, should become the president. Say if two people were running for president and one got more electoral votes and one got more citizen votes. The one with the more electoral votes would automatically win! Now, isn't this unfair? The people's voice needs to be heard and reconized!

According to source 2, the electoral college electors defy the will of the people. I don't disagree one bit that this is undoubtfully true. Millions of people live in the United States. Only 538 people are in the electoral college. We leave the hope of our nation into the hands of 538 people. What if one of the electors is crazy? What if they mess up on their ballot on accident? It's all up to them! We need to make sure that our voices are heard in the next election!

Some people think that the the electoral college is good because the electors know what they are doing. Well I say they don't! Millions of people do know what they are doing though and that's the very upmost important asspect of this whole essay.

Why are you reading this you may ask? Beacuse you have a voice that needs to be heard! We want our votes to count for something in our bleepin lives! Let's do this! Yeah! FOR THE PEOPLE!!       Â
