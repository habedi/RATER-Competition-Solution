My principal is considering a school change, well that's not very good at all.

Us students would not be happy with that. Fun activities and sports, we couldn't be happy. New school policy, in order to participate you have to have a B average, at least B average. Us students would go crazy without sports or activities. We need them, so we could be ready for whatever, like school work, test, quiz, and many more.

I mean, a C average is not all that bad, that just mean do better. I could pull my C up to a B average. Its not hard to study for test and to do homework everyday. Taking away activities are not going to do anything at all. Sports we do need, some people need the exercise. Well I need the exercise. School would be boring without activities and sports, without them your principal would take the fun out of school. In school are suppose to learn and have fun, we wouldn't have very much fun without activities and sports. This would take the fun out of education. We need sports and activities. Please don't change the school policy.
