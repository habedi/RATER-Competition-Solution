Dear Principal,

I believe that it is a good idea to require to perform community service. There are communities around that may need help cleaning up their environment and may not have the time to do it by themselves. Some communities around our area are poor and don't have the money to clean up litter that pollutes their compact. There are also some schools that have children that need one-on-one teaching. These are things that we, students, should help do.

Taking the time to help others and their communities would not be a waste of our time. If you decide to require community service, the acts in which we would have to do may get some students to perform better in their academics. Doing good deeds to others not only makes them feel better, it can also make us feel better about ourselves. For example if we have to tutor a child and help them understand that child would be grateful of you and you will feel good because you help a child understand something new.

If you choose to require community service, not only would the community benefit from it, students would too. It would help many students become a better person and feel good about themselves. In this century, many teenagers have a lot of extra time on their hands when the choose not to use the internet or their cell phones, there is a lot of time that a student could do community service and it would not be a waste of time. Those are reasons why that you should require community service. It makes others feel good and yourself.
