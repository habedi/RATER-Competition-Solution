I think the use for this technology is a good idea cause you can get a understanding of how students feel. This technology could be used in a lot of different ways. I feel like this technology should be valuable in on students in a classroom. They stated that "the facial expressions for each emotion are universal" Dr. Huang, "even though individuals often showing varying degrees of expression"A classroom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored.

This technology should indeed be used more offen cause theres so much you could use it for. With this type of technology we could figure out a lot about one or more people. The more we use it the more we will know about it and other people and we can use that informion to find different emotional expressions and we can make this techonology even better. That is why i think we should use this technology more in are class rooms or even are work space.
