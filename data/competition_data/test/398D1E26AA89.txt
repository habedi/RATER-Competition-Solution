Dear Principle,

I do believe all students should be required to do community service. It keeps the community clean and looking better. I don't think however that they should have to do it every day I think it should be twice or maybe three times a week. Because as kids we have lives outside of school so we really don't want to pick up trash every day. I remember one time when I was in fifth grade we had to go outside and pick up the playground because people were making a mess of it. It wasn't really torture but I wasn't bothered by it I mean it was actually kind of enjoyable. If the principle allowed them to do community service during school hours it might not be as big of a conflict. But if you make them come in after school to do community service it might result in a problem. Because there are other things that we would like to do, for example we would rather spend time with our friends or family. I just feel like if you're going to make kids do something at least reason with them a little.

sincerely,
