I strongly disagree with the idea that all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities after school. I disagree with this idea for 3 simple reasons. The first one being that some students may simply just not gave the time to the extracurricular activities. For example a student may currently be in a situation where they have a sick relative and they're the caretaker of the sick relative, for personal reasons. Therefore they have no extra time on their hands for this activities. My second reason is that some students may not have any interest in any of the activities the school has to offer. Now some people might say for the students to create something that hey would enjoy. Although that may sound like a good idea, there are some key things that you have to think about like budgeting and things like that.

Even though the principle thinks he/she is helping the students they're really just wasting their time. My third and final reason is some students may have failing grades. So all the extra time they might have during or after school they may want to spend that time dong makeup work to improve their grades.
