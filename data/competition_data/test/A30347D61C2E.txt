cars, they wernt invented in the old days. who needs them, not me. screw cars. Ill tell u what u need to know about life and transportation. We can limit car use if u just use this information and use it in your life.

paris has so much smog. Ew!!! No one likes that so lets limit car use. paris has 147 micrograms of matter in cubic meter measurement. Dang taxes! I hate soccer moms, my mom is one so i cant hate them too much. All they do is drive everywhere and use up all the resources so there kid can strike out in little leauge! Now i will tell you how to fix this problem.

if some of the stupid soccer moms driving around there rolling egg (mini van) the car use would be cut in half. Then you might say then what is my little kid going to do. You can read a biycle places just like it said in line 24 of "car-free day spinning into a big hit bogota. Now ill tell you what kind of bike and what your gonna do with it and your gonna love it!

A bmx bike is what im talking about. you can transportate it to the skatepark to ride the ramps. Its really fun and i love it. Those gas using Mini vans would be off the streets and bmx bikes can take over. Think about our earth for once please.

well to conclude things up car use is oversused highly. It is mainly the soccer moms fault. To fix all the problems in the world everyone needs to get a bmx bike and go ride some dirt jumps and this world would be a happier place!!!
