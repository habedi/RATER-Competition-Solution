Dear Mrs. Principle,

I think that you should select the first cell phone policy.

I think that cell phones can be helpful, and important to have and be able to use.

The first policy allows students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

I think that would be a good policy because if the student has forgotten something at home, or needs to ask someone a question, they can.

Phones could even be used for studying with a friend.

It is the student's choice to study or not.

If they can't use their time well to get good grades, that's their problem.

In the real world, there is nobody to make you work.

If you don't choose to work hard, you will get nowhere, and it is your fault.

If students can't ignore the distractions of a cell phone to study, then they will suffer the consequences, and they will only be able to blame themselves.

Teachers could also use phones (while the students are in study hall) to remind students of assignments, or upcoming tests.

The phones won't be on during class, so the students can't cheat on tests, or be distracted.

Also, if you pick Policy 2, students will still bring phones to school.

They will just hide them instead of using them in the open.

Unless every student is searched upon entering the building, there is no way to stop them from bringing their phones.

I hope you will consider these facts when you make your final decision.

Sincerely,

Student
