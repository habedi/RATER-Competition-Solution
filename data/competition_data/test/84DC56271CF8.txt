I do not think school should force kids to participate in extracurricular activities. Kids already spend a lot of time at school and if kids were forced to do more after school then that would be taking up a lot of time for a kid. So if schools decide to force kids to stay after school then it would not allow for kids to be with family, cause more stress on kids, and some kids already so something after school that is not run by the school.

It would not allow them to be with family. School already takes up about 50 percent of a kids day and if schools forced them to say an hour or two more then that would not allow them to have enough time with family. Family is really important in a kids life because they always support a kid no matter what, and if schools took away more of that family time then it would make kids feel more lonely. I know this from personal experience because after school I have soccer practice almost every day of the week and since my dad has a job then I only get to see him when I get home at 8 for dinner.

It would cause more stress on kids. Kids already have a lot of stress at school with all the projects that they have or upcoming tests and if schools forces them to do something that can cause more stress then it would just break kids down. Lets say you were forced to do yearbook. If you were forced to do yearbook then that would make you have to do more work as soon as you finish school. And if you were forced to do a sport then that would make you stressed about games on the weekends or training where you have to do a lot of physical activity. Since I am play soccer I understand the stress on physical activity because during the winter every other day we had to go outside and do a ridiculous amount of laps around a football field and a lot of push ups and sit ups. And when they finish these after school activities then they would have to go home and do their homework which can take up 2 hours which just causes way too much stress.

Some kids already so something after school that is not run by the school. There are a lot of kids like me that play sports not run by the school. Since people like me already do something after school then the school would not know that and they would make me do another thing after school. If I had to do two after school activities then that would take up all my time for the day and not allow me to do anything else. And if they ask people if they already do something after school then people could cheat it and tell the teachers they do to get away with a forced after school activity.

In the end I think schools should not force kids to do after school activities. This would cause kids to be too stressed and not have enough time for family and homework. And since kids are already stressed about school then adding this would just be too much which is why it should not be forced.
