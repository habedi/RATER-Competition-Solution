Dear Principal,

I would have to agree with policy 1. I do think children should be aloud to have there cell phones on at lunch and on at free period, and they would be turned off when a teacher is teaching.

Why i agree to this is because we need more freedom then what we get. We do get freedom but this should just be added. I don't understand why we cant have them out at lunch. Were not doing nothing wrong. We are still going to listen. I could understand if kids had them out during class time. That's when the teacher could take it away and that kid would have a detention. Then there parents would have to pick it up. If we were aloud to have cell phones at school that would be very nice. I would not take advantage of it. I would like it. What if there was an emergency and we didn't have our cell phones on us what would happen. that's why we should have them on us at all times. that's why we all need to agree with policy 1.

thank you for listening to my letter. I hope you agree with it with me. Just take a couple minutes out of your day to think maybe these children could have there cell phones on free time.

Sincerely,
