Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering changing the school's policy about students participation in sports and other activities. In my opinion I am against your consideration because a C average is passing the class at least they aren't failing. Don't you want your students to at least know the basic information they are supposed to learn in their grade level? Yes of course you want your students to know more than the basics but you see not all students are the same. Some students are brilliant in school but ignorant outside of school. Meaning they can have an A in their math class but don't get the right amount of change back when they go to the store. The other students are the opposite of the school smart students. If they have a C average and are let into participating in sports and other activities they will get motivated to keep their C average up that they may even raise it up to a B or A average in case they do bad on a test it won't take them out of that fun activity that they enjoy being in. Hopefully you take my view of your consideration into thought well because a C average is decent grade that earns a reward to be into a school activity that they would like to be in.

Sincerely,

Your Student
