Dear Principal,

I think not all students should be required to perform community service, everyday without realizing everybody does something to help people and the environment. I think it's important to help too, but i don't think people should be forced to. Not everyone spends half of their day with community service, but they do spend at least a minute of it without thinking about what they're doing.

I do know it is every important to help people and especially the earth and animals but everyone has their opinion with everything. Maybe we can get a group of people to do a little community service before or after school. I am sure a lot of people would love to help and be apart of a group who does help. Teachers and students could help it will do a lot to help and people could be with their friends also.

I know it's not just me who feels the same way, and I know people will vote against it but i strongly suggest you consider my opinion. I also know that some people do feel the same way and will vote for the same thing as I do.
