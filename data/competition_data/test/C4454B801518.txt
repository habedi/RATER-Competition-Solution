The principal should let students bring there phones to school because some students need to use they phones some times. I think we need to start bringing our phones to school. I no we don't need to be texting but we be needing our phones for other resins. Like we need to be texting but we will need our phone for important calls. Some people be needing to there phones to call there mother are dad to pick them up for school are from any other school. Some school don't even let students have in the school i don't see why. They could let them walk with phone its not they using it. Some principals are just mean just don't care. I now some be texting and don't need to be doing that but that don't mean to take students phone take there. Some students really need there phone. I would just like to walk with my phone with out some one takeing it.
