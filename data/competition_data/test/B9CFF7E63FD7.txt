Dear Principal,

I believe you should ban cell phones at school. There is no logical need for them, other than giving your buddy a quick answer on a difficult test or texting a false rumor to your friend. Cell phones on campus may give students an easy way to contact their parent/guardian in case of an emergency, which is a definite pro, but it also brings in a whole load of cons that I believe outweigh this small pro by a long-shot.

Allowing students to bring phones, but not allowing them to use them during class is somewhat a dumb idea. The temptation would be right there for them, literally in the palm of their hand. It would be quite simple to give an answer to a friend who happens to be struggling on a certain test. I am quite certain that choosing that policy will result in multiple incidents in where students will have their cell phones taken away, possibly for good.

Rumors are not a very kind thing. They can hurt someone, or might even be false, which could hurt somebody even more. Text messaging is used now by our generation more and more. It is now even being used more than phone calls. Allowing phones on campus just perpetuates the idea of spreading rumors. It would be simple and easy to just text message the latest rumor to your friend, who in turn might spread this juicy gossip to his or her other friends. Soon the rumor has spread all throughout the campus, most likely garbled and distorted into something completely different, possibly even false. If a student just has to tell something to another student, can't they just talk to them in person? Might it be somewhat easier to just catch your friend in the hall and speak to them? This way students would not be able to spread these dark rumors around, without looking conspicuous, that is.

Having a policy like so I believe will better the school greatly. The campus will be more friendly, more open, and more civilized than other campuses who use cell phones.

Please take all of these suggestions into serious consideration.

Yours truly,
