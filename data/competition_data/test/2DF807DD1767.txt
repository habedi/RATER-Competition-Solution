Students that take classes from home is way easier because people wont bother you while you are doing your work. It is also easier because they do not get homework because you already doing work at home. The bad thing about this is that the student is not going to have friends and he or she is going to be sad everyday not getting to know new people homeschooled is better than going to school in my opinion becaus eyou can wake up at any time,you can take breaks when you want to,and you have nobody to tell you want to do and bother you.

For example when my brother was taking home scholl he always wanted to know what we did in school because he is always bored and when i told him that he is lucky because he gets to stay home all day and not go to school he said "yea but i want to get to know people and make friends". i felt bad that he couldnt make friends.

Secondary,yea it is good going to school but some parents are very strict and they want the best for their children. some parents think their child will get bullied and they decide not to put them in schools and strict parents nake you take homeschool because they want to make sure you do your work all the time.

Thirdly,I always wanted to do homeschool instead because when i come home all i see is my little brother sleeping and im like ,"wow i wish i could sleep" but when you go to school you always have to stay awake or you'll get introuble for sleeping and the teachers will call the parents.

Lastly this is why i would love to experience homeschooled because i love how easy my brother says it is and that the fact that he is always asleep when i go back home.
