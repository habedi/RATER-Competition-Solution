Dear Principal,

I think students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are put away and turned of during class. I think this because students should be able to go on there phones after class and at lunch after being in class for a long period of time. Students should be able to stay in touch with others who they don't see at school or if there friends aren't with them they should be able to talk on breaks. Also students should be allowed to use their cell phones cause sometimes they have to get a hold of their parents if they forget something or need something or needs to ask them a question instead of having to use the school phone. Also if there was an emergency you could have your phone to call for help. Even though most schools don't let you have you phone out at any point during school i think they should change the rule and let kids have their phones out at certain times such as between classes and at lunch. Some people don't have time to go talk to someone because they might get a tardy so then between classes students should be allowed to text and call others. There are many bad things of having cell phones during certain times during school as well. People could be late for class if they are on the phone to long. There could also be a problem if students are on their cell phones going into class. Even though there are many bad things that could happen if schools allowed cell phones i think students should still be able to use them during certain times as long as they don't break the rules and use their cell phones at times they shouldn't. I think the responsible students should be able to use there cell phones and whoever breaks the rules and uses cell phones during class shouldn't be allowed to. The bad kids shouldn't have to ruin it for the good kids. All in all i think schools should have a policy saying students can use cell phones at certain points of the day because i don't think its fair that students have to sit during class all day without any free time. We deserve a break after all the work we do.
