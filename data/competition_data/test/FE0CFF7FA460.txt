Do you believe that students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity? This would be a very good thing because it could bring students out of their shell a little bit. If a student doesn't communicate with other kids very much or very well, they could join a club or sports team to be able to talk to people that have a lot of the same interests as they do. For students who go home and play video games and have nothing else to do, they can get out of the house and do sports, or a club. This would also bring out new opportunities for some students who want to do something but haven't looked into it because they just don't know what would be a good fit for them so they never try.

If there's a student who keeps to themselves most of the time, then that's fine, maybe that's just how they are. But if they get to a place where they meet new people and are around them a lot, then they'll begin to talk more, and just be happier in general. If a student doesn't have many friends this could be a great way to let them make some. In an after school club, a sports team, or something else, they're going to meet people they get along very well with. In an after school club, you have fun, and on a sports team there's a certain commaraderie that you don't get many other places.

Being in a school club or sports team will help students find friends with the same interests as them and that goes an extremely long way. Even just having something to talk about with other people that they feel comfortable talking to will make kids not feel lonely and bored because they have people to talk to. By meeting kids this way, the friends they make could eventually introduce them to their friends and then the friend group will continue to grow. By the time you're done with the club or team that you were on, you've met a lot of new people and friends and then over summer they could get together so it's like a gift that keeps on giving becuase the people you met over the school year are still hanging out with you and your other friends. Of course you're not going to like everyone you meet there, but that's just life. You can't expect everyone to like you, or you to like everyone. But you can surely try, by being kind and trying your absolute best to work well with other students.

It could also get many of the inactive kids out of the house. If they sit around bored out of their mind because they have nothing to do, joining a club or team could fix that, this could give them something to do. If they don't like or enjoy going to school, this could give them something to look forward to at the end of the day. Especially with sports teams, they make you keep your grades up in order to be eligable to play or even stay on the team, so this could also encourage kids to keep their grades up. If they play video games the second they get home and do nothing else because they have nothing else to do, this could get them out of the house and get them to be more active.

In conclusion, requiring stuents to participate in an extraccurricular activity could help students in many ways. They will learn better communication skills and also could make new friends. It would help students find other students that have the same interests as eachother. For students who are pretty inactive, this could help them a lot by helping them get out of the house and getting them involved in something. This would also bring up a huge amount of new oppurtunities for the students who want to be involved but haven't really looked into it that much because they don't know what would suit them the best. So why wouldn't this be a good idea? We should definetly make this happen because it could extremely help a lot of students and could impact so many people in so many different ways.
