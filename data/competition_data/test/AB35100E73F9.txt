I think it the facial action coding system would be good and bad in a classroom. I has some good and bad things about it like if a kid didnt want anyone to know about whats going on or if he just didnt know whats wrong with him/her. I think we sould really give kids the right to hide their feelings if they want to because i know what its like not talking about thinks but there is only so much people can take before talking so kids should reealy have the right to hide it if they want to. It could also inbarise kids because of them not wanting anyone to know they are sad or mad but the computor knows and they had not choice if the computor knows or not. I think kids have the right to have a little privetce and not have to tell anyone whats going one.

The facial action coding system is a good thing in school by letting the teacher know that something isnt right with that student and somethimng need to happen. i think that it will help kinds lern in school. I know when im sad i really just dont want to do anything at all and kids might feel that they dont have to do anything. kind need school the world we are living in would kill if we didnt have school so i nfeel like with other help for people teachers and the facial action coding system we could make the world smarter.

when i think about the facial action coding system i think yes it does take privatce away from kids a little but at the end its really help kids out in school or with bulling problems i think there sould be facial action coding systems in school with limits.
