Dear principal,

I think that we should all do community service. When we perform community service we help our community. I cant think of a reason why you would want to stop helping the community. Considering the fact that its our community and if we don't clean it and help the people in it no one will. So eventually our community will have to be shut down . Then were would we live and wouldn't you feel guilty knowing your the reason we have to shut down the community and move somewhere else. I know I would feel absolutely horrible, because a lot of people don't have the money to move.

We should also do community service just for the good of it. There is no better feeling in the world than knowing you did a good deed or helped someone. We could help by going into the classes and helping the younger kids so the teachers can get more work done and wont have to work overtime. We could also help pick up litter and trash on the side off the road so other people don't have to do it instead they can spend time with their family.

We shouldn't be absorbed in the stuff that we personally want to do because this stuff needs to be done its not just something we want to be done. This is so much more important then getting to watch television or play your video game because when you do this you actually accomplish something. You may say well if i don't watch this show i wont get to accomplish finishing the season or i just accomplished getting to the next level in this video game. But those are just little accomplishments that only matter to you and maybe your friends. Accomplishing community service matter to a lot more people and is more important. So please don't stop us from doing what really matters.

Sincerely, a student
