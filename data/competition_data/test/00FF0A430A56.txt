Dear Principal

I feel that everyone should not be required to do community service. I feel this way because community service should be a volunteering thing. The work will get done faster and have better quality if those doing it want to do it. The work will be sloppy and take a longer period of time if people are being forced to do it.

Perhaps if the number of volunteers is too low to participate in the service then try to get more people to help out by motivating them by offering rewards for their service. You could always try connecting the service with school by offering extra credit for those who participate. Or the class with the most helpers gets a pizza party. Trying things like this would increase the number of workers and the work quality.

If you would be interested and/or if the school budget allows it you could try paying students for their work to the community. Say for every job they complete they get three dollars, or for every hour of work they get five dollars. This would really increase the amount of students and the quality of the work.

If you would try forcing all students to work most of them wouldn't show up. The last thing a lot of the students would like to be doing in their free time is helping the community. So most won't go willingly but again if you try to force them they will most likely not show up.

One thing you could try is all the students that show up and work for a total of say six hours will get a free day. On an upcoming Friday the students that work for six hours or more will get the whole day outside to just play out on the field.
