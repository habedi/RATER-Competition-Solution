Do you drive a car? A truck? Or any kind of vehicle? If so, did you know your polluting the air? Why drive when you could car-pool, walk, or even ride a bike? Why risk your life everyday while driving your car into town to go to work?

To start off with, pollution is a big affect in this world today. China is one of the most polluted cities in the world. As stated in the article "Paris bans driving due to smog''

states that diesel fuel was blamed for pollution. Diesel makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. Have you ever seen someone black smoke? They probably think they are cool, but they aren't. What they are really doing is polluting the air, and it isn't cool.

Ever thought about car-pooling? Riding a bike? Or even walking to work, or school, or even to the mall? In my opinion those are some great ways to get around town. I understand if you live far out of town and you cant walk or ride a bike but maybe think about car-pooling. I would love  to car-pool with one of my friends to school. You have a friend to sit there and talk to you. Your doing someone a favor. Plus you never know when you'll see them again. You could always organize your life so you could walk or even get someone you could car-pool with.

Everyday you wake up not knowing what could happen. You get in your car not thinking anything bad could happen to you and then

BAM

! Another car as ran the red light or the stop sign and ran into you. And just like that your killed. You see, walking is easier to get around. Your still risking your life but not as bad as you are if your in a car. There is so many stupid out there that is driving drunk, high, or whatever. Their is even people out there that think they are cool when they really aren't. There are a lot of deaths out there that are caused by vehicles. So before you get in the car, think about walking. It's safer.

Now did you think about car-pooling, walking, or even riding a bike. Did you think about pollution or even your life. You might not agree with me but think about it for a little bit. I rather walk and get some exercise then sit in a car.
