"Congestionwas down 60% in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog" (duffer par.14). have you ever thought how bad cars are for this planet?

"Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution"(plaza par.24). I think it is a good idea to banned cars for a few days. This  is my opinion because if we take cars away then people will see how much more clear the air is, how much easier it is to breath, what good excersie it is for you, it will open some peoples minds about how the enviroment works and how bad cars are for our economy. "These people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders"(riera par.26). It is good because there is so much fog and pollution in the air that it is bad for society and how it is bad for us and the planet that we live on.

"amaeicas love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when ajusting to the population growth" (rosenthal par.32).people are realizing that their love with their cars isnt as big as their love for their own life and for their friends and familys lives."as of april 2013, the number of  miles driven per person was nearly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lines in the recession, because cash-strapper amaericans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway"(rosenthal par.32). people now a days dont have enough money to by a car for themselves because there arent enough jobs for all the people becayuse of the big population growth of america.

people are using technology to talk to people, and this means that people dont have to drive as often to go talk to someone. "demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerste. there hasa been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds gettin a license"(sivak par.38). younger people dont really want to drive to places if they can just talk to people on the phone. some people of this society are lazy because they dont want to get up and go places when they have their phones, but sometimes its for a good reason even if they dont know it they are not polluting the air as much as they would be if they drove to their friends/familys house.

how do you feel about how cars are affecting this planet and the way it works. these ideas and actions people are taking are going around the globe and it is saving the earth one day at a time with one little idea.
