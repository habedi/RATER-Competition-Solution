Dear Principal,

You have made a decision to let students participate in the school's activities ,but they must have at least a B average.

I must say it will take at least one weeks for someone to make the team and have that kind of average because most of the school has a C average.

I disagree with your idea.

I think students can have only a B or A average so you won't have to worry about the grades dropping.

You can always know if they are studying and making good grades.

On the other hand, it will make everyone pull up their grades because they know they will not be able to do any school or physical activity without that certain grade.

It may cause a great improvement on your school to let the grades go through the roof.

The reason I say it's a wonderful idea is it will make a good impression to see all your fellow students participating and at the same time bringing up their grades.

Parents would love to see their children playing basketball, cheer leading, football and all the other sports.

They would also love to see the grades improving.

I am not telling you how to run the school but you will never get the parents or students attention.

Not only would it cause them to pull up their grades it will cause them to act better in school.

You won't have to worry about any students in your office in trouble.

This is a fantastic opportunity to see your school rise and actually be seen.

Maybe you should consider on thinking about how this will effect your school ,me and all the other students.

As a fellow student I want to participate but if my grades are not where they need to be how can I.

We students will not go out without you saying no.

We will not back down because we also want to see our school rise.

It will be your decision to help us your school to help you.

Sincerely yours truly,
