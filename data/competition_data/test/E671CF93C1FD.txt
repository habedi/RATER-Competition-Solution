Phones & Driving

In my perspective, I think drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. The reason why I say this is because people don't pay any attention to what they are doing because they so caught up in their devices. Driver can get killed and they can hurt somebody else if they are using their cell phones. They not only putting their life in danger, but also somebody else's life too.

Drivers can be drunk while driving and be on their cell phone and end up killing themselves. Instead of being save and advoiding that risk that they are doing right now, they are being very dangerous of themselves and others. That's why now in today's history, it is rare that people pull over on the side of the road to be on their cell phones. The ones who do that are very smart because they aren't taking a risk to hurt themselves or others.

You have to be careful of what you are doing when you're in a car driving and being on the phone. That's why today, a lot of people buy a cell phone holder to put in their car. The reason is that they can talk on the phone but also pay attention to the road so they won't get in a car crash. It is just crazy that people would not think about what they are going to do when they are using a cell phone when they are driving. That's why for me, I think it would be safer just to buy a cell phone holder to put inside your car so you can talk but also pay attention to the road and what you are doing.
