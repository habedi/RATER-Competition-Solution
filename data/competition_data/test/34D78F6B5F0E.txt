The positive I think about driverless cars it awsome. Becuase who wouldn't want to enjoy that drives by itself. The author says that the driverless cars wouldn't prevent car accedents. It would be awsome to drive one of the driverless cars to work, home, store etc. all day and all night. I would go on dates with that car and to surprise her to go to prom, etc. The passage says that when you are on a traffic jam that it would lead you out so you can get on time wherever you going like job interview, doctors appointment, picking up kids from daycare or school, or even at a job meeting. When the driver is driving the car looks at them by a camara to see if the driver is well consitrating on the road, more likely a carsitter looking out to the diver on the road every time. Cars makers of Audi, Nissan, and Mercedes-Benz by 2020 they will make their cars driverless and with sensors to worn the drive when they are getting in danger so that the driver get back in focus on the roadwhile driving.
