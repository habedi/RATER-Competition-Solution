To begin, I feel like the Facial Action Coding System would start a big argument if it should be used or not. Most people are going to question the the software. For example, What if a student didn't want everyone to know thier emotions? Also, Isn't that kind of invation of privacy? But i can see the positive side of the new software to.

First of all, the new software "Facial Action Coding System", has a lot of positive sides about it. In paragraph six it says, "A classroom computer recognizes when a student is becoming confused or bored." This will modify the lesson it the computer reads that the student is confused or bored. Also, If the new system reads student emotions this could stop a lot of school shootings. Furthermore, If the new software doesn't recognize the student or person it could send an alert to the office and other classroom so the could lock their doors an hide.

Secondly, there are some negitives about the system. For example, in paragraph six it says, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication." This shows that the computer needs to understand that too. Also, Isn't the new software kind of invading your privacy? Because, What if you don't want anyone to know your emotions? Is this really going to help students learn or lose human emotions?

All in all, I personally think the new software should be used only in schools for the students, teachers, and staffs around the world. If this system can recognize students and teachers then doing the attendance should be quick. This new software could save students lives and stop school shooting. Do you want your childrens lives safer at school than a dead zone of kids?
