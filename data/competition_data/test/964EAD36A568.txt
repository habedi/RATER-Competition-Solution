Some schools require students to complete summer projects. The summer projects should be student-design because students would know to make the projects fun for the other students, students would be more understanding when or not projects should be done, and students would know what and where the projects should be hard.

First off, Students would know how to make the projects fun for other students because the students would think like the other students. The students would know way more about other students interests and likes better than any other teacher would. And the students would know more of what the others would like vs what teachers would think the students would like. Teachers usually dont get right what students would enjoy doing because most of the time they pick things they would like or what they assume the students would like. But most of the time the teachers get it wrong to what students would enjoy doing.

Another way would be Students would understand better when or when not to have the projects because some students would have days they would not want or cant have a project due to another reason. Students would be more understanding about it vs a teacher. Students would make the projects or scheduling of the projects way more convent for students. And the students would know when would be a right time to have projects depending on the other students. Sometimes students have reasons or excuses to not being capable of going or doing a project. Other students would accept it vs a teacher not accepting it.

Then lastly, students would know how to make things easy or hard for other students because students would know the other students better. The students will mostly know other students strengths and weaknesses better than a teacher would. They would be more capable of relating to the others whether or not something would be easy or hard. And they would know whether or not something should be challenging or way more challenging. Its like the if the students think its capable of being done then the other students that the project is for should be capable of doing it or would want to do it.

Others may say that schools that require students to complete summer projects should be teacher design due to the teachers having more experience with creating summer projects. The teachers would be more capable of actually making sure the projects happen. And would be more capable of having the students do something in the unfamilar. But there others that say summer projects should be student-design because students would know how to make the projects fun for other students, students would be more understanding when or not projects should be done, and students would know what and where the projects should be hard.
