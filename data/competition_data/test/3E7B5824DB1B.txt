Have you ever wanted to travel for work and see new places? Well, as a Seagoing Cowboy you can do just that with a little extra included. I am going to tell you why you should join the program. I bet you should want to join the program after reading this.

Firstly on the starting bell, I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy because you can travel anywhere for work and have fun. Evidence from the text that supports my opinion is that Luke headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses. Also, Luke passed the time with table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games. Both of thiese examples show that he had a lot of work to do but when he finishes early, he speeds op time with fun activities.

On the other hand, being a Seagoing Cowboy could be helpful at a young age because when you are 18 when you start and quit at 24, you could have some skills that could be usefull for an other job. Evidence from the text that supports my opinion is that Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. As well, Luke had to feed the animals two to three times a day. Both of thiese examples show that if you become a Seagoing Cowboy and quit, you could be very good at your job if you become a zookeper afterwards.

My conclusion for this essay is that if you join the program, you could be informed by going to new places. Also, you could get new skills that could be usefull in the future like feeding animals and cleaning. If you do decide to join the program and become a Seagoing Cowboy, be aware of the risks but in all together it is a good idea to join.
