Did you know when you are having fun your mind is focused on what you are doing and nothing else. Yes, I think kids should get into sports/activities because they can make new friends, have fun, and it can take their minds off of things. It might be time consuming and stressful but if you are having fun that's all that matters. You also don't want to regret not doing any extra activities in the future so I would advise students to get more involved if they would like.

Kids should get more involved so they can make new friends. If they are going to play a sport their teamwork can start to increase if they are making new friends weather they like them or not it makes you feel better inside about yourself and if your coach were to see he/she would be so proud and might talk to you about it. If you make friends along the year with them then you guys can hangout outside of practice/activities. They can also practice with you and help you out to. If you don't really like them its your choice if you hangout with them or not but once you get to know them better it is always good. Overall it is always better having someone by your side then having no one.

Activities are always fun if you make it out to be. It is only boring if you make it seem that way, so if you actually get into the activity and act like your having fun then maybe it will be. It is always about having fun so if your not having fun then theirs no point but if you put a smile on your face and try with your friends than you will have a great time. If you wanted to excersize but never have the time or don't feel like doing it, you can do it in your sport because most likely they will make you run,stretch, or make you do some type of excersize before or after games/practices. It may be stressful at first but you have to fake it till you make it. If your making the most out of it and having a blast that's all that really matters.

When I did cheer my mind was only focused on that and nothing else around me. I was not stressed because I was only paying attention on cheer but if you take your mind somewhere else and think about how much homework you have to do or if you have to clean your room before your parents see that will be what is making you stress out. Before you think about that you have to think about what is happening now in the present tense not past or future because you can think/do that when the time comes. While your playing a sport that should be the only thing that is in your head at the moment. Everything is only hard if you think about it for an example if you like someone and think it will be akward talking to them it will only be if you make it that way. Same as in stress it's what you control if you are going to make it stressful or not.

It could take up some of your time but it is worth it in the end. If you are having fun,making friends, and nothing is stressing you out than I say go for it and try-out for the team, or helpout teachers, or get into a club whatever makes you happy at the end of the day. This is why I think kids in school should get involved without their being any stress, making friends, and having fun.
