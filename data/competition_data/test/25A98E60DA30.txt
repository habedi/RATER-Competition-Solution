Community service is a very good plan , community services need more reliable citizens to depend on . Community service doesn't actually have to be just cleaning up litter , community service can be helped in many ways , Such as Cleaning up Beaches , streets/parks , or helping at an after school program . Community service is a very good idea .

Some Beaches are usually filled with Dirty Garbage that people leave behind when there on their vacations . At beaches you see bear bottles , can's of soda's , plates , and even wrappers that can affect our environment and animals . Streets are full with things that people throw out of their cars even if its against the law . Littering our streets can be a big conflict to our drivers , anything can happen to the wheels while there driving . Parks can be a fun place for kids to spend their time but also there dirty with candy wrappers , ice cream wrappers all these sort of things should be improved to help in our community .

Middle School teenagers are more active , and have more time then these adults . Most teenagers do not work , these teenagers have time to spend on helping our community . Some of my friends think that Community service is a waste of time , that they have better things to do then just pick up garbage , i used to think that i picked up enough garbage at home . But when i realized and asked about community service , my room is nothing compared to the garbage out there in just one street block . It's their decision to perform community service if they want to or not .

Helping in an after school program can be very fun for teenagers . They can get to show kids and give them a heads up on what high school is like . teenagers can volunteer to help students after school on their homework , problems and for the best part they can also at the same time get their High-school hours . Kids will have fun play and learn things everyday from these Community programs .

These are some of hundreds of ways that teenagers can be part of Community services , they can ask questions or find put more by searching what community service is like .It can make a Big change in their lives .
