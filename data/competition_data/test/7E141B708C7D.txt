Most would agree for FACS (FAcial Action Coding System) to be put into school programs to tell how students feel via emotions. But as a fellow student I am againts facial action coding system. The only reason to for me to be against is that each human expressses emotions differently. Some may express them but others prefer to keep their own emotions to themselves. Because if you read someones facial expressions in a classroom through FACS is basically an invasion of privacy. Having someone constantly tell what you're feeling, and having the power to read others as well.

"A classroom computer could recgnize when a student is becoming confused or bored Dr. Huang predicts". That is the only facial expression I would agree to be read by FACS, In order to tell when a student is bored with homework or confused on a subject to help the teacher help their students when they feel those emotions. But using FACS to tell if a student is depressed, sad, angry, or happy is in my opinion an invassion of privacy. In the article it states "To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful".

FACS can glady tell their emotions but not children. Because if used in our school programs, we are slaves of our own emotions. Some will try to hide their emotions but will be unable to. Most will not use any emotions while in school, in order to hide what they don't want seen. Using FACS in school to tell what emotions students are feeling shouldn't be used in my honest opinion.

FACS should be used differently In some other aspects. Such as "The same technology can make computers-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery". FACS should be used to better the world and the people living in it. Not using it to invade their lives, and telling what they feel.
