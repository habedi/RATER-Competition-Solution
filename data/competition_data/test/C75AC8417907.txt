During the summer, many students usually do not do anything school related during this time. They would most likely forget what they had learned from the previous school year. Some schools have given the students projects to do during the summer but the projects are usually designed by teachers. However, it would be better if the projects were designed by the students themselves.

When a student designs a summer project, it would give them more motivation to work on it. If people were to do things they wanted, it would make them more comfrontable and motivated to perform the task. Whenever there are summer assignments, they are usually made by teachers. Some students will still work on the project, but it would be more easier to do if the students were the ones who made the project. A student would usually prefer if they could design the summer assignment themself instead of the teacher.

Having the students create the summer project can also be enjoyable for them. Usually when a person does something they want to do, it would usually be something of their interest. Students would less likely perform a task if it were something that did not interest them or that was disliked by the them. Having a school project designed by students would further make the students more motivated to design and complete the summer assignment since they would create it in a style they are interested in.

Letting a student design their own summer project would also show what the student still remembers any knowledge from the school year and put it into the project. If students did not have much interests or lacked enough content to put into the project, they would most likely add content they had still remembered from the school year into the school project and this would help show if letting the students design the project was effective or not in terms of what they had still remembered from the school year.

With all the ideas the students could have in designing a summer project, there are still some issues that can occur when a student designs the summer assignment. They could go off track with the project and not put in any academic related content into the project. There are also a few times where a student might actually lack ideas to add into the project which later might end up not having much of a project at all. However, this is why there are summer projects, it is to have students continue learning during the summer. Schools should still have the students design the project themselves.

Students will most likely forget what they have learned if they were not given a summer project. But if they were given one and had to design it themselves, it would have many benefits such as: giving them more motivation, enjoying the project whenever they work on it, and showing what they have learned from the school year. That way, the students would overall continue learning through the summer while also enjoying themselves.
