The face that was found on Mars may be made by natural causes. There are many reasons why this odd shaped figure would be made by natural causes, like gust of wind throwing rocks around could make that human like face. Or something that can pick up big boulders and can move them into place. There are many reasons why this face showed up, but aliens are not one of them.

What might have caused rocks to move into place to create this human like face is large gust of wind. Or something that is really strong. Or it could have been a big pile of rock and just formed over the years into a face. In the story "Unmasking the Face on Mars", there is more then one lump of rock there is two. The second is just not shaped like a face. There are spots everywhere on this planet with lumps of rock. Most of them are formed by erosion. Erosion is the process of being broken down. There could be parts of the lump of rock that wasn't strong enough to hold it's self up. They may have fell in to make the eye shape. The nose could have been another small pile of rock that made it look like a nose. This is from up high it may look different down low. It may look like a big piece of rock. There are different views or angles you can look at it.

Other people may think that aliens did this. But there was no traces or marks left behind that can detect an alien. In the story it says, "There was no alien monument after all." Now in the story it says that all the traces of the alien that did this were covered in haze. In paragraph 12 it says, "

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."

They strongly agree that this is just natural causes. Now they are probably still doing some testing or research about this face. But they strongly agree that it is just a natural cause. Formed by erosion,or gust of winds,or even soft spots.

They shape is another crazy thing added on the list of things that NASA sees on different planets. This is just another figure made by the planets natural causes. Thats why NASA believes it was made by natural causes and nothing like aliens. This is just another cool object found on a planet.
