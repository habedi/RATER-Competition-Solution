The Facial Action Coding System would be very valuable in classrooms. This device would let teachers understand student feeling better. To which would let the teachers be able to switch up how they teach that student . This device also uses a very reliable computer program to calculate the face muscles. This would make it the most relatable to human facial muscles.

Finally, this device has many benefits to it such as, reading emotional expressions and even telling if there faking that expression.

This use of this technology would benefit teachers by letting them know how the students feel. "By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions"(D'Alto).For example lets say a student is feeling fustrated on a test, so he might show he's happy so the teacher wont come question him. The teacher can use the FACS device and understand exactly how the student is feeling. Instead of him thinking that the student is happy he could look on the device and it would tell him exactly what he feels and what percent of all the emotions take up. Overall, this Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in the classroom.

Another way this technology is benefical would be the calculations of the muscles of your face. What this means is the device would " constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"(D'Alto). This model would show your face muscles and it would calculate how the are moved or know as "action unit". Then based on the movement of those muscles .The FACS device would list one of the" six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadeness"(D'Alto). Finally, the last step to FACS device would be to get the results on that perticular person emotions.

In conclusion, this Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to classrooms. This device seems to be very reliable and can be used in many ways to just reading emotions all the way to using in drama class to react an emotion more realistic.
