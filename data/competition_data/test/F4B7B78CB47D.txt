Dear Principal,

I believe that children should be required to do community service because it shows that its important to help others. I think that this should be pushed on to the students so then they start to help their community become a better place.

I think that students need to be informed in the different things that they can do in their community. Such as, helping make a community garden or making a basketball court outside of school. I don't believe that most children think that they can do anything in the town to help. Therefore, if you make it required that children have a certain amount of hours in before they graduate high school, that it will help them become aware of the things that they can do. I believe that if children know that they have a say and can do something in the town, that most kids may focus more on the positive things and not negative. Such as, more kids will get together to do group projects that they will all enjoy and not doing things that could harm themselves and others. Children will be able to be with their friends and doing something good for the community at the same time.

Students also can do stuff for their school, for example starting groups to get foundations to help with the softball and baseball fields or getting new goals for the soccer fields. The kids being in group projects to help their town and themselves. Many students have a technology class that they're enrolled in, so they can make benches and donate them to the town. Students that are in different clubs can also do different things that can help, for example saving money up for different things and donating the money to different places, such as charities, cancer researchers and to the community to help with the different things that the needs to be done.

Children can do and have a big part in many things, so I believe that they should have a chance to have a part and say what they think. I believe this is why students should do community service, not to just help your community but yourself too.
