Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I, STUDENT_NAME, think you make it so that every student is required to complete a certain amount of community service each semester. Students need to learn that not everybody is as lucky as them, and that there are many people out there that don't have a home or food to eat. Students need to give back to the community.

Children these days take many things for granted, such as the house they live in or the food they eat. They don't realize there are many civilians out in the world that have no home, no food, and nobody to help them. Many people/children turn the other way when they see these people, choosing their own selfish needs over these helpless people in need of food and a place to stay. Students would rather spend time at the mall or playing video games instead of helping out the community by picking up litter or visiting a nursing home.

It is up to TEACHER_NAME to require these students to give back to the community, to open their eyes to the world around them. By making these students do community service you are giving them the gift of knowledge. The students will be less ignorant and not take things for granted such as their education. The students will have a new found knowledge of the homeless, the poor, and the starving, and many will go on and do more than required. They will go above and beyond and raise money, go to nursing homes, and help out at soup kitchens. All thanks to you TEACHER_NAME, for requiring them to do community service. This will also make the students want to strive for greater goals in life in order to help the needy even more. They will not take their education for granted and work hard for good grades.

You have a decision to make TEACHER_NAME, whether to require students to do community service or not require it, but I highly recommend you to require it. So that the students will become less ignorant and not take things for granted. So that they learn life lessons, and strive for greatness. If you choose to require the community service you choose to make a better, brighter future for these students!
