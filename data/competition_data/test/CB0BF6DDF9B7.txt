Dear principal,

I agree to policy 2 because the student don't pay any attention in class and the students are texting during in class. The teacher is taking and the students are texting with a friend. Policy 2 is a great decision for all the student do not text in class. Principal policy 2 is great because the student need to pay attention in class and do class work. All students need to turn off they cell phone and de work, is for they future. I think policy 2 is great because is for the best, the teacher need to take they cell in class when se a student texting in class o in lunch time , they need to pay attention in every class. Dear principal is a great policy and the student will accept this policy. Cell phones is for a call you morn no for texting with a friend in class time. Cell phones are that cool in the school.
