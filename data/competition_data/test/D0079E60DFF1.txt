Dear Principal,

In my part of opinion i think that students not being able to participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is great idea. There are many kids that just want to join sports, and are not doing good in their academic or unified art classes. It is very important for us to have at least a B average in all our classes because learning more, and studying harder is something we can do so we could do sports . Also it would be an advantage to the school and for us kids. If this policy does apply, many kids will start working harder, trying harder, and improving in their academic skills. You will see a difference in grades and averages if the policy does apply to the school. It i will not be a difference that will change in a bad way ,it will be in a good way kids will be learning more, and doing more work, more homework more often because sports is a very good way of us kids having a fun time after school hours. For example, kids at our age tend to do many sports because they do not want to be home alone or bored. We like to go outside or spend time with our friends, but most of the time it's a lot of friends getting together to go outside to play a sport. Also, many of the sports that we play outdoors or indoors our school has mostly all of them and many kids try out for all the sports. They think that they will just play with a C average , that is not right. A student must have at least a B average to know that he is not just in the sport to play, but because he is working hard in classes and also in with his team. I hope i have convinced you to apply the policy.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
