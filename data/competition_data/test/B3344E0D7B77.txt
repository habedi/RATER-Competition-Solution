A vast majority of people who have seen "The Face on Mars" belive that it was created by aliens.

This cannot be true because there is too much evidence to disprove this conspiracy theory.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens because it, in fact, does not even resemble a face, and there are many others like it on Mars.

There is too little evidence supporting that it was created by aliens, but there is pleanty of evidence that supports the fact that it is just another rock formation on Mars.

One example of this evidence is that The Face doesn't look like a face at all.

In the passage "Unmasking the Face on Mars" is states that the picture taken in 2001 of the eleged face "actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa."

In the 2001 image taken by MSG (Mars Global Surveyor) you can clearly see the large rock formation that is present on Mars surface.

It very clearly shows that it is not a face created by ancient aliens.

Some strong belivers in the theory that think it was created by aliens state that NASA is covering up the truth and not telling the public the truth about the Face.

This however just would not make any sense.

If there was an ancient civilization out there on Mars NASA would want to make it public because this would benifit them.

They would be funded by the government to study the artifacts or maybe even lifeforms out there.

In "Unmasking the Face on Mars" it states that "the defenders of the NASA budget wish ther was an acient civilization on Mars."

Not telling the public about alien civilizations just would not be a smart move on NASA's part.

This wouldn't be the first time NASA has found a huge rock formation on Mars surface.

Scientists have come across a massive amounts of rock formations in the time they have been exploring Mars.

This is just another one of those cases.

When NASA released the picture of the Face to the public in the caption they noted a "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head." (NASA)

NASA never did mean for the Face to be hugely popular and for theories of it being an acient civilization.

It probably never crossed their mind that theories this preposturous would appear.

They just wanted to draw attention to Mars and the space program.

There are a large number of rock formations on Mars and this was just another one of those boring old rocks. The face just goes to show how people are fantastic at blowing things out of proportion.

These formations cannot and were not built by an alien civilization.

There just is not enough evidence supporting the fact that it isnt just a mesa or butte like here on Earth.
