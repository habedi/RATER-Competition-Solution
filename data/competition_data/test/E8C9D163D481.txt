Venus is the second closest to the sun. this means the temperature there is way higher than earths. This also means that the atmospheric pressure on venus is also way higher than earths

Venus is second away from the sun this means its has a very great temperature. Venuses average temperature is about 800 degrees. Venuses atmospheric pressure is about 90 times what earths is. No space ship has lasted on venus for more then a couple hours. Scientist still believe that at one point long ago that venus could of been the most earth like planet in the solar system.

Scientist believe that to study this if they stayed about 30 miles above the surface of venus that they would be able to study venus. The temperature would still be toasty at 170 degrees but the atmospheric pressure would be equaivalent to that of sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful on venus and the radiation wouldnt exceed that of earths.

Science shows that maybe right now venus isnt the most hospitable plant in our solar system but maybe at one time is was.
