25 years ago NASA discovered a face on Cydonia, Mars. It was extrodinary looking like an egyptian face! Many people think it was a human face that aliens created, but surely enough it isn't. As a scientist from NASA I know for sure it is definitely not. NASA went into further detail with this "Face". We looked further into the face just to show people that this is not a face created by aliens.

Further more we found it was just another Martian mesa, common in Cydonia. Since the face was becoming popular, being in movies, magazines, radio shows, and books we had to prove that we are right. As a result in 2001 NASA took a even closer and more clear picture of this face on Cydonia. It showed that it was just illusions making the mesa look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Making this mesa look like a face. This revealed to all people that this face is just a natural landform.

In conclusion NASA knows more than just typical average day people. NASA has proved us wrong from thinking it is a face created by aliens. This is just an illusional face as I would say. As a scientist I do wish that there is alien life on Mars, but as far as we know there is none. So the face on Mars is not a real face but just an illusion by natural land formation!
