Dear Principal,

I am against having a B grade point average to play sports or to do the activity. The reason why i am against it is because many students fail to do that because they don't try sometimes, but some people try and just can't make that B grade point average. So I think you should move it down to a C grade point average to participate in sports and other activities because you see most athletic people having a C grade point average most of the time but there are some B grade point average athletes. The other reason why i say you should change it into having a C grade point average is because a C is still passing also because at a C grade point average it is easier for the students because all they would have to do is do the work and get at least a C and if they can't get that then they just don't deserve to play on that team or do that activity. Then you could also do if you say everyone has to have a C grade point average instead of a B you could tell them if they get more than 2 D' s or 1 E than they are off the team or will not be doing that activity.

Sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME
