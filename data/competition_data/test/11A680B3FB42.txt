Dear Principal,

I think you should require us to do some kind of community service. community service helps build character and helps people be understand some things. I think we should do community service because all of us needs to help out the community we live in. Some people does not like the place we live in but there are places way worse then us and we could help make our community or even state look better if we did some kind of community service. We should all give back to our community for all it has gave to us. If our school does some kind of community service then that could inspire some people or even another school to help out then it would be a domino effect. I think if people don't want to help others then they should never get help. Some thing we could do is plant flowers and trees, clean up trash help other people with jobs like building houses or even giving money to help with a soup kitchen could help a lot. Things like that could go a long way. You could help some one find a job so then they are not depressed and they have some thing to live for everyday or help feed some one that could some them there are some more nice people in this world and he could be inspired to help more people when he is able to. If some people doesn't want to help out then that's there lose to an amazing opertunity like this. That's what i think our school should do some kind of community service to help not only other people but help our self find out who we really our and build our character.

Your student,
