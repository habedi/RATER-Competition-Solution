Usually when school is out for summer break, you instantly forget about everything that you have learned. Nowadays, schools want you to do some of project or activity to assure that you have more knowledge and learning throughout the break. If these projects are really going to happen, they should be teacher-designed. If these projects are designed by teachers, then they are most likely going to be more educational, you can get hands-on help from a teacher, and overall they can allow you to become more prepared for the upcoming school year.

Firstly, these summer projects should be teacher-designed because they can be more educational for the students. By doing this, you can learn many things that you never knew before. Such as ; a certain word problem, how to do an equation, or many other things as well. When the summer projects are finally over, you will be able to look back and see what all new information you have learned.

Secondly, you can get better hands-on help from the teacher. Say one of the projects is about somethingÂ you have never seen or learned before. Obviously you are going to need to get help or a teacher's assistance. Instead of having to solve the problem by yourself, you can get someone's help so you can figure out what to do and how to do it.

Thirdly, overall a project designed by a teacher will allow yourself to be be more prepared for the up and coming school year. If you have a project based on one of the classes you are going to take next year, you can start preparing based on that. You can start learning what the class is all about too. At the end of the day, no matter what type of activity or project it is, it will prepare you for the next school year.

In conclusion, it is better for summer projects assigned by the school to be teacher-designed. In the end, they are way more educational than a project designed by a student them self. If you are not understanding something,or if it is difficult to complete, the teacher can help you out. Also in the long run, it will prepare and better yourself for the next school year.
