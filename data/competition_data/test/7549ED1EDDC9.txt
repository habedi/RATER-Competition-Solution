Which leads to my next example, in certain school you have to pay fees every time you graduate to a next grade. The pricing can usually come up at least one hundred dollars and some families cant afford to pay this. Also, some school require school supplies and ask for more than whats needed. Money is being wasted when buying things that are actually not needed. On the other hand, distance learning lets the student buy school supplies that are necessary for them to learn.
