Saving money is one result of limiting car usage, another result is that limiting your car usage can relieve some of your stress. There are many places that do it today, like Germany, Paris, and Bogota.

In the first souce "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", it talks about how you aren't tensed up all the time anymore, one person even said "When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way". what he means by "this way" is that he is much happier that he doesn't have to worry about a car anymore. In source two, "Paris bans driving due to smog", it shows that many people are getting fined because they have an even numbered liscenes plate, the same applies to the odd numbered liscenes plates the following day. This can cause stress if you do not listen to the instruction because you woud get a fine of 22-euro, or $31. If you listen to the law, you can also save money.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can relieve stress and save you money because you won't have to worry about other people crashing into you, and because you won't always have to buy gas for your vehicle.
