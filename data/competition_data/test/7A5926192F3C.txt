Dear, Principle

I have acknowledged the fact that you have changed the policy to having a B average or no sports or other activities. I am sure that at the grade level of Jr. High School it may be very hard to maintain a B average. I think otherwise, many students should have at least a C average to participate in the sports and activities. I think this way because when I go home to do the work I was assigned I realize that even though my teacher taught us the lesson, it is very hard to understand unless I spend an excessive amount of time reading the textbook. For other students this may not be the case but other than that maintaining a C average or above requires hard work at the age of fourteen. I would agree with your policy if you changed it to a C average for sports and activities.

Sincerely,
