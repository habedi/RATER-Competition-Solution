Is Texting Worth Your Life

In the United States the number one cause of motor accidents are distracted drivers, evidently these are people who text and drive. People know this fact yet accidents due to distraction on ones cell phone still arise in todays generation. Some people think that they are a experienced enough driver to be able to get on their phones and send a text, search the web, or make a phone call. However, studies have shown that it is impossible to focus on two things at once. In the United States 1 out of every 4 car crashes are due to texting and driving.

The National Safety Council reports that "cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year". These statistics are frightening and eye opening to those incompetents enough to believe that they have the ability to text and drive safely. These victims are actually not experienced drivers but are mostly novice drivers. Police reports most of the accidents are caused by young adults. According to a AAA poll "94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driver, but 35 percent admitted to doing it anyways." Their young arrogance puts their lives at risk and states like Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, and other states outlawed texting and driving.

The risk that people of any age take when they text and drive is far too great and the laws set in place by those states are meant to protect us like any law should. People might not only hurt themselves, but they can hurt someone else who has loved ones. In conclusion, the final text to a loved one, boss, or friend should not be the last message of your life.
