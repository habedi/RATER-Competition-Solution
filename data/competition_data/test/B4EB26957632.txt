Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard of the idea you've developed on how a c average determine wether a student has the ability to play sports or not. I do think that grades should effect student's athletic privileges, but that is if a student fails a class or multiple classes. Failing deserves no privileges and a c average is not failing. A c average is between 70 and 79 and failing is 69 and below. I do not think that the idea that you came up with should be enforced on student athletes. I think if a student athlete works hard enough but still does earn grade of a c in a class they deserve to participate in sporting activities because they still put forth all of their ability to pass the class.

I also don't think the idea should be passed because i just finished up basketball season and towards the end of basketball i had a c in us history class if the idea you have would have been passed i wouldn't of been able to finish the season with the team and help win our last game.

Again i do not think the idea should be passed for these specific reason. A person can only try so hard and i am sure student athletes try to exceed their limits.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
