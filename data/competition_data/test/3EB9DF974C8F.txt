hese two articles both shows reasons why we should limit car usage. I know people are going to be like, " How am i going to get to work?", " How am i going to do this and that with out my car?", but if you sit down and really think about it there are some very good reasons why us fellow citizens should limit our car usage.

On paragraph 3 source 1: In German Suburb Life Goes Without Cars, it says " when i had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way, a media trainer and mother of two as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and he chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor" in this quote it talks about how a mom is going green and starts walking and bicycling instead of driving every day. If you drive everyday you lose alot of money thru out the year spending on gas, car repairs etc. and you pullute the air, now a days the air that we breath is getting worse and worse by the years passed but we could fix it if we limit our car usage. With going green and limited driving you could start walking and get good excersise, our world to day not doing so good and one main reason is because of pullution and obesity. You could knock both of those out by just simply walking to the store instead od drving and losing gas. Cars are graeat dont get me wrong, they have been the a big impact om our world but it changed over the years as people started buying cars and gas prices and oil prices are going up, we should all just go green for a while.

It will help if you just stop drving one time a week, that will make a impact to our society. I dont think people shouold be fined for driving a car that they payed for and that is theirs, if you could talk well and a good persuader you could change the mind of the citizens. Hopefully the world changes and goes green a little more eery thing helps. Â
