Being a student that has had a summer project being able to create your own project, apposed to a teacher making one for you, makes the project less bitter to complete. Letting students create their own project gives the students more enthusiam to complete it, more creative/fun projects can be done, and it will have the same goal which is to continue to learn throughtout the break.

Throughout the school year students are given multiple projects by the teachers, some harder than others.

In these projects you find multiple requirements, all teacher designed. When a student goes on summer break most of them are worried about getting to the beach or spending time with their family. Having a student designed project takes more load of the student when it comes to completing said task. The project would be able to relate more to the students life and point of view, and would the prompt would be fun to complete. When students get the oppurtunity to be creative and think outside of the box they do not fall short to the task at hand. Having completed a student deisgned task, it gave me more oppurtunity to think outside of the box and go above and beyond without getting the feeling as if it was classified as a school project, that most dread to complete.

From the teachers standpoint having a student-designed project can go in the completley wrong direction, and steer the project away from the main idea it was intended for. The project is meant for you to learn, and having a student create the project could completely defeat the purpose of maintaining the learning aspect of it. The project would have some sort of creativity to it, and it be would getting straight to the point of understanding what needs to be done. The main goal of a teacher is to teach you and prepare you for the criculium guide you to success. When students leave for summer they forget more than half of the learned matieral from the prior year making it harder for teachers to teach because the basic learning aspects could be lost. That makes it harder for teachers to do their job and keep students foucsed and on school when just getting back. Having a teacher give you project to work on during the summer gives you a oppurtunity to still learn and focus on being a kid/teenager at the same time.

Kids are creative, scientifically more creative than the average adult. When giving a project to the right students they can make something boring into a entirely different situation. Many students have come up with incredible ideas some adults would never have thought about. During the summer most students go on trips, play sports, hang with friends, or simply stay home and relax. Student-designed projects could give students the oppurtunity to have fun and complete what needs to be done at the same time without going to far out of their way. The projects could be student-designed and teacher edited, so when the student create the project the teachers could revise and make sure the students are staying steady on their learning task.

The goal of having a summer project is to stay fresh in the brain and have a little bit of a challenge during summer, so you do not complety forget and lose focus during the school year. Students can achieve the same task while making it a better overall situation. Teacher designed projects can be fun too, but student designed projects give the student more of a chance to take control of something, realize the importance of whats going on, and how it can postively affect the students learning career. During a kids time in school there is not many oppurtunites to make your own project and see the affect it can have on you. Getting students involved helps them realize how important it is to their success as a future adult and their future learning throughtout school systems.

Having a student designed project comes with many benefits not only to the students but the teachers. The teachers have less of a work load to complete, giving them more of a break during summer beacuse they will not have to create the project and focus on making sure the students understand the prompt.
