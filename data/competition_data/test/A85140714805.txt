Many scientist believe that studing venus can be dangerous but it is worthy to learn about it. The author has very good point that we should find out more about Venus. They say that Venus has been covered in oceans in the past. It may have provied life like earth did."Often refered as Earth "twin ", Venus is the clsoest planet to Earth term of density and size , occasionally the closest distance too." states the author. This means their might have been life before in Venus.

Even though it is dangerous to explore I feel that we should beacuse it is important to learn about our planets. Venus reaches the average 800 degrees Fahrenheit. "The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experienece on our own planet." Those are hard chellenges that scientists have to phase when exploring the planet. It is so intresting to learn about our planets. We can compare them. "Venus has the hotest surface tempertrue of any planet" staes the author.

Today Venus still has some of the same feature that are the same. Like our planet, Venus has valleys, moutains and craters . The planet also have strong earthquakes, and tunderstorms. Thsi makes it extra hard for scientists but its makes it hard. In text it states that

"Solar power would be plentifuol and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but survivable for humans.

In coclusion, it is challenging but anything is possiable. I do agree with them."Our travels on Earth beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expand ed to meet the very edges of imagination and innovations." We should not have fear of exploring. That is what the author is saying. We should all agree with this. Life may be hard but we should explore.
