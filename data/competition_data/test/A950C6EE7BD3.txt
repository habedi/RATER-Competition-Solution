according to the passage there is somthing call Facial Action Coding Smile . Can this be useful to school's ? Yes the reason why I say yes it's because some studets can understand some thing . And if they can understand it the computer could be able to under stand the assingment well . Also this can help see where is it the student struggles . And it can be a game changer for alot of school .

Some good things about the software are that know's if you force a smile by detecting the muscle in the face. For example if a student gets stuck on a question or the teacher is busy with the another student or if you dont feel like bothering the teacher the software could help . This program can help or notify the teacher if a student is stuggling and with what they each struggle . Because in some schools teachers can't find out what is wrong with some student . This can really become somthing great for the future generations by modfing the lesson for each student . For example if a student doesnt like the subject the program can detect that and make it funner . The reason why is because some students think some teachers teach boring things and with this program it can make the lesson funner .

In conclusion this software could really help out schools . By making students like school because some complaints I hear from some of my friends is that a certan teacher is boring or they can't make the lesson fun . So if the lesson is boring the camara can check the face the individual is making and modify the lesson . This program may also raise a generation of smart students if this where ever to happen . In the end I think this program could also make some teacher smile .
