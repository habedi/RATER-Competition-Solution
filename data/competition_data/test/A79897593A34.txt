Dear Principal,

I enjoy watching and participating in the school sports and other activities that we are provided.

Many of our great and amazing athletes in our school today are not very good with their grades.

This is why they play and are good at different sports.

Sports is what allows them to get away from the school atmosphere.

This is a time where they can relax and just be themselves along with many of their friends.

I disagree with you changing the required grade average for many things.

One thing is students who have a higher grade average may not want to participate in school sports.

Therefore, changing how many people we have on a team or what sports we do play.

Another thing is some people cannot manage getting a B average for their grade because of personal reasons like family life.

Families play a big part in how students act in school.

Playing sports for their school is how they escape from possibly a hard and difficult family atmosphere.

A third thing is that not having enough players on the team presents a disadvantage in a game.

It gives the other team a better chance of winning since they have more depth in the team roster.

A fourth reason that changing the grade average is a bad idea is because people who have a higher grade average may take more interest into school itself and not sports.

If this was to happen, we would have less and less students participating in school sports or activities.

Something else that might happen is that not every person in the school is athletic.

The school would want more athletic people to be on the team to help have a bigger advantage in winning the game or activity.

If many of the students in the school have a C average, changing it would decrease the amount of people who are eligible to try out for the team.

Changing the school policy would decrease the amount of people who play on the teams or who participate in the activities.

Leaving the policy the way it is gives the school a better chance of finding the right people for the team.

The school deserves a fighting chance in all of the school sports or activities.

Having the grade average where it is currently residing will give us that fighting chance.
