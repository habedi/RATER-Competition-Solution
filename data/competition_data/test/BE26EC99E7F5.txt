Emotional expresions of students in a classroom are valuable because they show what they feel, as well as actons do. It would be awesome if this creations would be created because when a student is bored, their face will change they way of a lesson if needed.

Studens emotions are valuable because they express how we feel, like if friend dies, our face will show that we are sad. If we do great on something, like winning a contest, our face will show that we are happy. Our teenage years are the most important because we have alot of different emotions, that change our lives.

Another reason that students emotions are valuable is becease we are growing up. Growing up is hard for parents, but it is hard for the kids too, they have to deal with the parents strict rules. Emotions are what makes you, me , and everyone else. Our emotions tell us who we are, what we like, how we feel.

Emotions make character in every circumstance.

The text states " For instance, you can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on their face." We have 44 muscles that make us unique, but they all show the same emotion. We can try to hide our emtion, but there will always be one person who can tell what emotions you are really feeling, that person is you, your parents. When you make a certan face, only you know that feeling at the moment.

If you have real freinds they bring you up when your down, only because they see your emotions.

In conclusion student emotions are valuable because, emotions make character, they also change lives, they make you, you. and they leave an impact. they show what you feel. They also show if you disagree with something. Those 44 muscles in your face makes you unique, nothing can change that, thats the best part, God made no mistakes, he made you in his image. People try to hide their depression, when they do it gets worse, only because they didn't tell anybody. Your emotions as a student can either make or break you in life when you get older, its all in your face.
