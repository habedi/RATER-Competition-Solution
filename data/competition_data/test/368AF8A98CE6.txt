Are school days becoming even longer? Well, according to our principal, yes! The decision has been made that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Nobody strives to spend even more time at school, especially it is being forced. In certain circumstances, the times chosen for these activities could get in the way of free time, students could need to assist around the house, and sometimes the clubs or activities can get expensive.

Some students participate in extracurricular activities that may not be through the school. These things take up a tremendous amount of time as is, and then to having to do another activity on top of that, can be very distressing. Other students could also use this time to finish school work. It could be as simple as a small homework assignment, to studying for an S.O.L. This time may even just be social time. Spending time with friends, family, and other important people in their life could be a way to take a break from the extremely stressful school day. Although school and additional activities may be easy to balance for some students, It can be very difficult for others to find the time and the energy to do these things. Having the option to participate in one of these clubs, sports, or councils can give the students time and choice to figure out what they really want to do.

The time needed to practice for a sport, or do volunteer work for a club, can mean very little time at home. Occasionally, the parents or guardians of the student may need their child's help around the house. It may not seem like much is getting done, but a little goes a long way when it comes to helping out once in a while. Some older students may even have younger siblings to look out for after school. Depending on the situation, the parents might have to work on weekends, which would leave the older child responsibility for their siblings when the parents aren't there. There are also points in time where the student may need to just go home and relax. School can be very draining for some students and make them just want to take a break. This break might be just to take a 30 minute walk, or they might even need to take a few hour nap. It mostly just depends on the person, the classes they take, and even the school they go to.

In certain homes, money may be an issue. Sports and clubs are most likely going to need some kind of supplies that needs to be provided by the student, or the parent. Although colored pencils and crayons may not seem like a big deal to most people, when families are struggling to pay bills, that's the last thing you'd want them to worry about. Some sports even need a payment just to play the sport. So, paying about fifty dollars just to play, and then having to pay for the shoes, mouth guards, and other appropriate clothing for that sport, will eventually add up to be a lot of money. Not all families struggle with this, but some do. Having to ask your parents for money when you know they're struggling is very difficult. I've personally been in the situation where I couldn't participate in some of the activities because I didn't want to ask for more money knowing it was scarce as is.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities should not be required. Students should get a choice on whether or not they want to participate in these things. There's already a lot of time spent at school learning and doing some of the same things that would be offered in a club. There is no need for a requirement of additional activities. I strongly believe the schools should stick to encouraging students to join, not forcing them. It would make students more independent, responsible and hardworking.
