Driving while talking on the phone is so dangerous. Lots of people get into car accidents because their driving and texting, meaning their not paying attention to the road. I don't like to be in the car with people who text and drive because their putting my life in danger.

In 2013 1.2million car crashes involved teenagers texting and driving. When people are texting and driving they lose their focus on the road and start to swerve. When you start to swerve in the road because you are on your phone you cause someone else to swerve and it causes a big car crash.

When I get into the car I pray. When I feel like someone I'm in the car with is about to pick up their phone I grab it before they could get to it. I'm so afraid to be in a car accident because I have seen plenty of them happen and it traumatizes me.

I have anxiety real bad so when I'm in the car with someone and they start going fast or text and drive I have a panic attack. I hate being in the car with people who drive fast and text and drive. Before I get in the car with someone who drives like that I would walk or stay home.

My words to people to text and drive is, please STOP texting and driving, its not cool. It causes many accidents. When texting and driving your not only putting your life in danger but your also putting someone else life in danger. PLEASE STOP TEXTING AND DRIVING, ITS NOT SAFE!!!!!!
