Cars are an easier form of transportation and can benefit anyone that knows how to drive. The use of cars in the United States is bigger than the use of cars in any other country. On the other side of the world mostly in Europe and also South America they are trying to get rid of cars because of many different reasons. Cars can be beneficial but they can also harm us. Everybody thinks that cars can be helpful if an emergency happens and yes that is right but the pollution of cars can also harm nature and mess with the air we breathe and it can lead to everyone dying slowly.

Take Germany for example. In the German Suburbs they are going completely car-less in a city called Vauben. Here, if you want to have a car, you need to either buy a space in a large garage for $40,000, along with a home or you can just move out. They are trying to make the streets better by improving them and all cars do is harm everything. In this city, 70 percent of families don't own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here. All you hear in this city are bikes and people talking which drowns out the car noises in the far cities. Now lets take a plane to Paris and see what goes on there. In Paris, France there has been a ban in driving cars and whoever disobeyed this law was going to be fined 22 euros. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to this fine. All of this happened because of the smog coming from Beijing, China. The warm days and cold night caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and diesel fuel was blamed. Paris normally has lots of smog, but this time they decided to get rid of the cars which make the smog worse. Public transportation was free of cahrge because of how many people had to leave their cars. Since the smog cleared up after a couple days, they unbanned some of the cars.

Bogota, Colombia has a car-free day every year. This has been going on for 3 years now due to the fact that cas are polluting too much air. The only thing people could use were bikes, buses and taxis. The goal for them is to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. The violators were fined $25. The rain wouldn't stop and that was an excellent way to take away stress and lower air pollution. This year, two other Colombian cities joined the event. This also promotes broad and smooth sidewalks for people to walk on. In the United States, just a little above Colombia, President Obama says that we might go car free too since people are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. In New York the bike-sharing program reflect there new priorities. People now a days would rather take a public transportation than buy a car, they don't even bother to get a drivers license anymore. Most people now actually like to walk and get some good exercise or just take a bicycle wherever they go. The number of car use by young people went down 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 which shows that young adults would prefer to walk or ride a bicycle wherever they go.

Overall, cars are being used everyday less and less and all this is mostly because of pollution. Not using a car can benefit us in many ways also. Walking is a good source of exercise for anyone and after a while you can even find yourself to be a little more fit than you used to. Riding a bicycle is also good for your health because it is another way of exercise and promotes a healthier body. The use of public transportation is only helpful if you go somewhere far that you can't exactly walk to or ride a bicycle to. The less gas-powered vehicles we uses, the less pollution we have and the healthier the air will be for us. Imagine living in a pollution-free place where the air is cleaner than ever, wouldn't that make you feel better? It can also stop many diseases from runnig through the air because of the dirty oxygen thatÂ  we breathe.
