Dear TEACHER_NAME

I am writing to you to inform you of what i think of community service. Some kid's in our schools think it is boring and waste's time on what they need to do. Others think it should be used for disapline. I agree that we should use it for kids that act up or have detention because they would have to clean for what they did and it wont waste's the teachers time. The reason they should do this is because they wasted their time fooling around in class so now they have to make up that time by doing the service. Another reason why they should do this is because the world is filthy enough that we cant have that no more so what they can do is clean the public park of all its trash .There is a lot of different needs to be done all around the schools and maybe they can do some of that. Their might also be stuff in school to do so they can do that to. If this works maybe the kids in the schools might not act up and pay attention in class.

sincerely, my name....
