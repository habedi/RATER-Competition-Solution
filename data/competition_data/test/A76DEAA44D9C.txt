Projects is like supreme pizza. Each project consists of many details and ideas, which combines as one big main idea. Not all projects are boring though; coloring and drawing plays a huge role in how the project is represented. My science fair project involved bright colorful headings with colored pictures on a poster board displaying how gravity affects light fragile objects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it requires students to challenge themselves, it allows students to be creative, and it helps teachers receive feedback.

One reason summer projects should be student-designed is because it pushes students to face a big challenge. For instance, last year my English teacher assigned a project to complete based on the book

Animal Farm by George Orwell. She explained we needed to design the format and organization of the main idea without going off topic. I struggled to think of a theme for my own for days. After planning for a while, I decided to illustrate pigs on their hind legs with ribbons, a horse, a sheep, a cow, and several guard dogs for the pigs. This project required me to think outside the box and was the most difficult one I was assigned.

Another reason students should design summer projects is because it allows students to be creative. For example, my Spanish teacher always assigns chapter projects, and the most recent I did was about the train station. I was allowed to make the project in anyway as long as I used the right grammar and all of the vocabulary stated in the chapter. First, I wrote a dialogue between an employee and customer with a variety of colored pens. Next, I illustrated small pictures for the vocabulary. Then, I glued the dialogue and pictures onto light yellow construction paper. Lastly, I designed the title with bubble letters and a blue colored pencil.

In addition, summer projects should be designed by students because it helps teachers analyze the students idea and theme of the project. For instance, I was given a project on trade routes in my advanced placement history class. My teacher addressed me to design the project in anyway about one out three trade routes. I chose the Trans-Saharan trade route and made a pamphlet that tourists would use to travel. I explained what food was there, what the climate was like, what they mainly traded, what was most interesting about the Trans-Saharan, what transportation thats provided, and what to avoid while traveling there. Once she graded my project she had a meeting with me about the way I expressed the trade route. She told me the idea was extremely creative and the information I used was excellent. However, she said the pamphlet would be more neat if I organized it and added pictures for examples.

Some students argue teacher-designed projects are more of a learning experience. However, student-designed projects teaches students how to be independent and responsible. For example, this year I was assigned a project on

Julius Caesar , and I was to compare two different characters by using my own theme. I came up with three different sections for the project on my own without help; I made two slogans and wrote one speech in the positive character's point of view. I had a week to complete the project and present it in class. The deadline and the whole project taught me how to manage my time more consistently, it taught me how to work alone, and it taught me how to be responsible for my own grades.

Moreover, summer projects should be student-designed to help students have a more knowledgeable education. I propose students write a letter to their principle about why students should design their own summer projects. As a student I would like to receive the best education so I am more likely to succeed in the near future. Designing my own summer project helps keep my mind fresh and helps me grow more wise as a person. Having to face a challenge myself, to be able to be creative, and to help my teachers receive feedback are reasons summer projects need to be designed by students.Â
