The use of the Facial Action Code System to read the minds of students is valueable in a classroom. There are many advantages that having this software used inside classrooms would bring. It make it more fun for both the students and the teacher.

The Facial Action Code System could let the teachers know if the students in her class are confused about something or even bored. I think that students would be less likely to want to learn about something if its nothing fun that is being associated with it. In paragraph 6 it stated that ," A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored Dr. Huang predicts, Then it could modify the lesson". I feel that would be effectived in the classroom becuase if the computer were too see that the student wasnt learning or bored while its on it then it could change up the program so its made more interesting for the student and make them learn more.
