I definitely agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For one, it would help raise their GPA, especially if it is low at the moment. Most of the time there is an extracurricular activity for everyone, like STEM, Home EC, Yearbook club, Shop, and so on. Extracurricular activities provide a fun alternative than just going home at the end of the school day. Students can stay after school, come before school, or even go during their lunch period to their extracurricular activity.

However, an injury or disability, like a broken leg or perhaps a learning disability could prevent a student from doing an activity that they want to do. Most of the time there are other activities that the student could do if they can't do the one they want. Sometimes, that particular activity could be canceled, maybe due to the weather if it is an outside activity, like a sports club, or maybe the supervisor isn't there that day. Maybe the student cannot go on a particular day because they already have something scheduled after school.

Some people might not agree that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. They might say that the student may not have time for it, or there is no activity that they like. If there is no activity that a student wants to do, they can just start a club for it. If they don't have time for that particular activity after school, they can just integrate it into their daily schedule. For instance, if they can't do it on a Monday, they can do it on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. They can also serve on the student counsel and perhaps get a particular activity listed as something other students can take. For example, if a school doesn't have a

Home EC class, the student counsel can possibly try and get that into the course list.

Taking an extracurricular activity is a good idea for anyone who: has a free schedule; wants to increase their GPA; or wants something fun to do. There is almost always an extracurricular activity for everyone. In conclusion, it is definitely a good idea to take an extracurricular activity whenever possible.
