"Driverless cars are coming" ! I CANT WAIT, Driverless cars will be a success to the argriculture of technology. Honestly, i think that it will make a big differnce diffence on the way people get transportation from place to place.

First of all one thing i think will ciome in handy when dealing with driverless cars is customer service. There wont be any one in the car with you so thats one less complaint about the driver being rude if youi need a ride somewhere as if it were a taxi or and uber. People may disagree with the idea of driverless cars but there are just as many if not more positive things about them as there are negative things about driverless cars.

Think about all the handicapt people on earth that cant drive and would rather not get on the bus, they would not have to call a taxi either if there is a driverless car in ther garage. A lot of people do not like to drive everywhere because it can be exhausting to many. That is where these cars come in handy , because they might still want to drive in there own car but just dont want to drive it.

Another fact about these cars is once they came out they would be evolutionary. People are already amazed at the fact of the creatation of hover boards ,and if that exites people then how do you think they would feel once a driverless car is released? since 2009 google has had cars that can drive independently. those cars still need a human in the car just in case of parking in garages or road blocks, or even traffic detours.

The only bad part about these cars i think is the price it may cost to purchase one of the driverless cars. Drivers would not get board waiting to drive because once the driver is ready to drive he can turn that mode off. It also is just a new and improved way to trasport and have fun while doing it. you would be amazed at how many people turn out to like it after they had bad thoughts on the driverless cars .
