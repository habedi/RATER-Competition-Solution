Dear Principal _____,

Community service, I believe, should be required in high school. Some students are complaining that it should not, but the only reason they dislike this idea is because it would waste their own time. Should we not think of others over ourselves? I support having community service required, because it improves students' character, looks good on a college application, and will help the people who need it the most.

First, community service would improve a student's character. An experience such as this would open their eyes and show them a different point of view. Walking in someone else's shoes would hopefully give them a change of heart or view towards community service or charity. Even if they are not helping out people in need, but instead cleaning up the trash in the local park, it would still give them a change of mind. Maybe next time they are hanging around the park they will bother to save their soda can or candy wrapper until they can throw it away properly. I believe that experiences like these can almost definitely result in changes in a person.

Secondly, having community service hours looks great on a college application! Most colleges not only look at a student's grades but the amount of time they have put into sports, extra curricular, and in their community. By requiring students to put time into community service for school, you are helping them kill two birds with one stone. It is almost like having a project for school that you must do and receiving extra credit for doing it.

Last of all, community service is a great way to reach out and to help those who need it most. Although people may not realize it, there are so many people in your own community who are poor or homeless. Even helping tutor younger children will improve the community. Having all students in the high school go out and volunteer would be a help to everyone in this situation. People will be helped, and students will feel good about themselves, while also raising their chance of getting into their choice college.

Improving character, looking good on a college application, and helping our community and the people who live in it are all reasons why community service hours should be required in school. There is no reason why we should not get out into our community and help out any way we can! If students think it will only be a waste of their time, maybe after they get a taste of it and the benefits it reaps, they will think again.
