I don't think that you should have a B average to participate in sports. The reason is because what if you aren't that smart they're not going to let you on the team? What if you slip up and your grade average drops down to a C are they going to kick off the team? I agree that they should be passing all of there classes but I say with at least a C average not a B average because there is a lot of people that are good at sports but they aren't that smart. That is my side of the story. Please don't change the policy so that everyone has to have a B average to join a sports team. If you don't change your mind and decide to go on and change the policy so that if anyone that wants to join a team has to have a B average just keep in mind that our team will not be as good as it can be.
