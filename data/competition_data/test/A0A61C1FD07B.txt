Dear Principal,

I am sending a letter regarding the policy u have for sports and other activities, there is a lot kids interested in sports that tried to pass a class that difficult for them with a C or C+. i know that you are trying to encourage kids to get a B but it is hard for some kids who are bad in one or more subjects. the reason that i am arguing about this is because i have seen kids trying pass a class C or more in the hard subject.

One time i have been in the same situation when i was failing math, it took me a lot of time and hard work to pass that class to play football for my school. there is a lot kid who plays around with the class because there of their sport or activities, that they don't try at all on pass their classes. i kindly ask you to change policy of getting B grade to C grade, so the kids have little hope on their studies and play in sports too.

A lot of students think that sports is better that studies and just try their hard sports and then goof around in their class and only try to get C grades and then they can still play. this why that policy came up but there a lot students who try very hard in their sport and class. we must think about them how hard the struggle to pass a class that hard for them.

i conclude that you please change the policy from B grade to C grade for participating in sports or other activities. this can a lot students who are trying to pass these class that are hard for them.
