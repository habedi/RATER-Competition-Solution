Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Although summer break is a time for students and teachers to relax, it is still important for students to continue learning. Coming back from summer break can be hard on students because they usually have not done any work at home. Something that could help students stay actively learning is a summer project. Opponents wrongly believe summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers would chose a project that stays on the curriculum and all students would be doing the same project. Although some may believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects should be student designed.

There are a few short term benefits from students designing their own projects. Students are more likely to do a better job on the project if they are student designed. If the student picks what he is doing his project on he is more likely to do a better job on it. For example, when I get a project that is teacher designed I am less likely to put effort into it. It gets students more excited about doing work when they are familiar with the topic. This would also benefit students because they know what they are capable of doing. Students might have to spend money on a project because they do not have the materials for the project that the teacher assigned. For example, I find it easier to do projects on subjects that I'm well aware of. It would be easier on the student if they could do a project within their limits. Students would have a much more enjoyable experience if they were allowed to design the project. Usually when students have a good time doing work they doÂ a better job on it. For example, when my elementary school did science fairs the students always got to pick the topic we used in the project, it was much more enjoyable than when the teacher picked it. There is no point in students doing a project they are not passionate about.

There are also long term benefits from students designing their own projects. Students designing their own projects can help teach them creativity. Students always have to follow exactly what the teacher says and that leaves no room for creativity. For example, every time I get to design my own projects I discover new artistic abilities I never knew I had. This can help students in the future by reminding them not everything has to come out of a book and it is okay to have original ideas. Another long term benefit would be protecting students self esteem. If a student is struggling to complete a project that the teacher assigned it could lower their self esteem. For example, I have had many projects that have made me feel like I was not as smart as the other students because I did not understand the work. A build up of failed attempts could lead to students doubting themselves and giving up, however if the student designs their own project they are more likely to succeed. Lastly, it gives students a chance to be independent. Little things like simply designing their own project can go a long way. For example, I always feel better after accomplishing a project that I designed by myself. Over time students could develop real world skills from simply designing their own projects.

Although some may believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects should be student designed. The opposition incorrectly believes summer projects should be teacher designed because kids will struggle to find something to do and teachers know what they need to learn. Summer projects should be student designed because they will do a better job on it, students know what they are capable of doing, and it is more enjoyable. Additionally, it teaches creativity, boosts self esteem, and it gives students the chance to be independent. Schools should take this into serious consideration so students can stay activley learning in an easy way while also having fun doing it.
