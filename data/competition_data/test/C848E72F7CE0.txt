Dear Principal,

I don't think that it should be a requirement to do community service. There are many after school activity's why not make this one of them. There are many children that would probably just leave, and not help the school at all. Requiring all students to do community service just is not fair. Most students have after school activity's like sports, clubs, tutoring, and helping other people.

Another thing that is not fair is sum children are already doing community service. most children need tutoring to get better grades in school, and community service would just hold them back from getting the education they need.

Sum people may think that its worth it to donate time to community service. Although others would think its a waste of time and not do anything at all. You may think that it is a good idea to make all students do community service, but me and a lot of the school do not think kindly of it. most people would see it as a punishment. Like they did something wrong that they cant figure out. That is why you shouldn't do community service to all students.

Sincerely Yours,

STUDENT_NAME
