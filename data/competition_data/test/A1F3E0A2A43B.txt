About 57% of schools students participate in extracurricular activities. This means that over half of every school has students that already participates in an activity. I disagree with this decision because some students do not have time after school, don't have the transportation afterwards, or not interested.

With this added, where will they find the time for their home life?

First, I disagree because some students have a job after school. Some students have to work that job to help support, so having this added would just add to their stressful life. Second, some students have to help their families with things such as chores, make dinner, etc. If they have to stay at school longer, some of those important things wouldn't get done. Third, as we get older we get more homework and harder tests, so it's up to us to keep up with it. After school is the time where the students get to study or do their homework, so when would they do it if they have to stay after school everyday?

Not every student has transportation afterwards, so what do students do when no one can pick them up? First, parents are busy people and have jobs too. Some parents just can't leave work to get their child. Second, if they don't have a ride, they will have to wait with a teacher until someone can pick them up. Thats not fair to the teacher, but to the student too. Third, students would have to bug other busy parents to ask for a ride home. Their friends parents can't always take them home, so on those days how do they get home?

Some students just aren't interested, so why make them do something they don't want to do? First, if they are not interested, they most likely wont be paying attention. If the students not even paying attention, whats the point of even having them there? Second, they would be distracting the people that want to be there. If a student isn't into what they're doing, they are most likely gonna move a lot, make noises, or talk to the people around them. Third, they most likely wont put any effort in what they are doing. No one wants to be around the kid that doesn't do their work, so whats the point in them coming if the aren't going to put in the effort?

In conclusion, that's why I disagree with the decision. I believe that every student should have the choice of whether they participate or not, due to those factors.
