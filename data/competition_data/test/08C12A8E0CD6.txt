As Luke says you can take many great expeditions, and it made him more aware of people and their needs. Luke had just turned 18 and that meant he could be drafted into war. But he was on a cattle boat so he could keep doing service there.

By the time of 1947 he was discharged, Luke had taken nine trips! That's a record for any Seagoing Cowboy. A big reason that you should join it (as Luke recalls), is because you get to help people in need. And get to lean more about there country. In the story Luke says that he got to see the Panama Canal. Wouldn't that be amazing?

Luke felt that it would be a chance of a lifetime to go and be a Seagoing Cowboy, and he just couldn't say "no" to Don. In 1945 WWII ended and many countries were left in ruins. So Don and Luke signed up to help. They helped for about two years before they were released.

He says that he also has much fun on board as well, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They played games of tennis and volley ball where the animals once were. You'd have much fun on board and on trips.

Those are just a few examples of why you should want to be a "Seagoing Cowboy". As Luke says it is much more than an adventure. It opened the world up to him and is grateful for the oppertunity that he had. There is so much more to learn about as well but if I were to try to explain it all I would need a lot more space.
