Yes, I do think that community service is very important and it will he the community if we do this service. This however, is nerve racking for the other students who don't want to strain themselves over something like that so here is what I suggest you should do. You should hold it as an after school program, in this way everyone has the freedom of choice. If some people do want to don't want to do it then that's their opinion. Same for the people who do want to do it. It is their choice and opinion if they want to sign up and help the community. This is why i think this is a good idea: If everyone had to do this activity, then the people who don't want to do it will feel like they are being pitted against their freedom. What I mean by this is they will feel like they are being treated as slaves. This will lead to the people who don't want to do it to revolt against it, and that will lead to problems in the future. So i think in my opinion, that it should be more of a want. I don't think it should be required because for all we know there could be someone who unable to do it considering transportation problems or something like that. In this way less problems will occur in the future and nobody feels like their freedom is being taken away from them.... A total win-win situation! With this being said, that is my thought use it as an after school program and make sure that it is a want, not a requirement.
