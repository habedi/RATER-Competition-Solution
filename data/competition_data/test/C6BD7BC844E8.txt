The author supports the idea when he said "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-Like planet in our solar system.' he supports the idea when he said that because he is saying that Venus is fascinated, Why because it's a look like planet that we live in Earth, their is other wonderful things down in Venus like he said there was "The lanet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains,and craters.". The author finds it intersting when it comes to Venus, he's not the only one other people also would like to go to Venus in see what is in Venus or how Venus looks in face to face seeing it with your own eyes in flying out your self. Also this is dangers because not one space ship can fly out so far from out of earth to make it there then to came it come right back it will take years for it in also a lot of things to make the space ship go in come back safe, people that would like to do have to risk their life to that, you have to be sure about it before doing it. Earth levels won't be the same, "Researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of venus.". We hope for them to find a way for the space ship to get where they wanna do in for the ship and the person going in the ship goes afe in comes back safe to Earth.
