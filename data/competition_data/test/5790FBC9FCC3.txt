I really enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy. It was a really good experience for me and I learned a lot along the way. I think anyone in for an adventure would be an amazing Seagoing Cowboy. You should really be a Seagoing Cowboy for these reasons.

One thing that made it really enjoyable was playing games with the other cowboys after we droped off the animals. We played things such as volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, baseball, and boxing. We also had a lot of extra time to whittle and read. Another thing that we had fun doing was seeing the amazing sights. I have been to an excavted castle in Crete, and the marvolous Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. The place that was most special for me to visit was the Acropolis in Greece. Another thing that was really special was taking a, "gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with steets of water." All of things are a really good experience for people. The last thing that was really interesting was working with the animals. I had some experience from helping my aunt Katie at her farm when I was a child. On the ship we have to feed the animals, give them plenty of drinking water, and clean the stalls three times a day.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a really fun job to have. I had a lot of good experiences along the way. Being a Seagoing Cowboy " made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."
