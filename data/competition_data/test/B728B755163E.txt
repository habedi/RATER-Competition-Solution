Driving and Using Phones

Driving a car requires lots of focus. It is not something to try and multitask with. Majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Cell phones can be a major distraction while driving. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Trying to use a phone while driving can be very dangerous or even life threatening. Anyone can easily look down for a second and instantly be in a car wreck. No one ever understands what life changing things can happen in such a short period of time. Not only can the person using their phone while driving be severely injured, they could also injure someone else or even kill someone. For example, if a person is driving and they are on their phone. And they hit someone, resulting in killing them. That person will get charged with vehicular manslaughter. Where they can end in jail for up to six years or maybe even worse because they were on their phone. Then their life is ruined.

Another reason why people should not use their phones while driving is fines. It is not only dangerous to do so but can also be pretty expensive, fines can be up to a hundred and fifty dollars and tack on a point to their driving record. For most teenagers when they get up to 4 points on their record; their license will get suspended.

Also no one can actually focus on two things at once it is actually physically impossible.

If their brain is focused on their phone. Whether they talking on the phone, texting, or checking social media; their brain is paying attention to that and not the road in front of them.

Using a phone while driving is not safe and definitely not worth the consequences. Make smart choices and don't use your phone while driving. Your life may depend on it.
