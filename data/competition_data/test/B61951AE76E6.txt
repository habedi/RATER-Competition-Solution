The electoral college should be abolished. In the second story and on the thirteenth paragraph it states that presidents mainly get picked from bigger states. "Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states". This ensures that the small states, like Ohio and Rhode Island, have no chance in winning.

Popular vote should rule which candidate gets chosen. In the second story on the first paragraph it explains how a cadidate won the popular votes, didn't win the presidency. "...According to a Gallup poll in 200, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." He would ahve won, but the electoral college voted him out.

Thetie could happen with the electoral college. In the second story on the third paragraph it says that the election is a few voters away from catastrophe. "And if an electoral tie seems unlucky, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;In 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way." This could never happen if the popular vote was used to decide who to elect for president.
