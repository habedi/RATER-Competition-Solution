Have you ever been forced to go somewhere you didn't even wanted to go to in the first place? Well imagine that your principal says it's a must to participate in extracurricular activity.

I disagree because you shouldn't be forced to participate in something you don't want to do. It could be good but people have other things to do. Some people may not attend them because they have a sport that they do that goes on for about 2 hours after school, people have lots of homework too, and some have siblings to take care of and that's way more important than just going to a after school activity. People have responsibilities and forcing a activity on them, they wont have time for their other personal business that doesnt involve school. there are good reasons to go to do a extracurricular activity but people are just busy and schools shouldnt be forcing students do to at least one activity because where is their word in that.

They let you choose what activity to be in and which is fair but the fact that students already have so much to do it would put more stress in the students when school is already stressful enough. Teachers or principles wouldnt even know what they could be going through. The schools should think before putting more stress on the students. Just putting more requirements will mentally hurt them especially when some students are already stressed enough. That just some students but other students are available and have lots of free time and they are able to participate in a extracurricular activity.

Then again there are good reasons to participate in a extracurricular activity. A reason to go to one is its good for students do something that gives them a break from school and they get to choose which activity and whatever activity they chose and they could find new friends and that will make them happy. A other reason to go is if the student doesn't want to go somewhere they can tell their parents and give them a excuse that they are staying after school and then they off the hook. Now they dont have to go to the thing they didnt want to go to. The last reason is they can actually go do something instead of being home all day doing nothing just on the phone. Going to the activity would be so much better than just doing that, plus they could tell their friends to go do it too because it would be so much better with friends.

In conclusion I still disagree on forcing a extracurricular activity on students. Students have lives too and schools shouldn't take over the best hours of not being in school and schools control their lives all the time. People have better things to do so its just a waste of time. Overall doing a extracurricular activity should always be a choice not a must.
