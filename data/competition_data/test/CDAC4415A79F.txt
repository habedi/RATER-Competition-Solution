The Mona Lisa is one of the greatest pieces of artwork Da Vinci has ever created. It shows great craftmanship and 83% happiness within her smile, according to a new face recognition software created Professor Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science, and Professor Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. It creates and analyzes a 3-D face to assume what the person is feeling. This could also help students in other ways, by scanning their faces and trying to help them if a problem seems confusing or difficult, but this would give them less privacy and less security. This new system may not even be accurate, in which if they analzyes and assumed wrong for the painting, then the students' expression would also be wrong, making this system completely false and unusable in any way.

First off, a painting is different than a person. You can't accurately assume what the expression is if a person painted it. The facial structure would be slighly different from the actual person, because there is no way to completely recreate a face, especially back when it was painted. It may be very similiar to the person, but it is not the same person, meaning that the software has incorrectly given this person inaccurate or false emotion in which they previously did not have.

If this software doesn't give the correct answers to a painting, then we can assume it wouldn't work a human. Humans can show more visual expression than the software can detect. There is no setting for nervousness or joy. If someone was crying tears of joy, the computer would see this differently, and say this person would be very sad instead of being joyful. Humans can also fake expressions. If someone was sad, but had a smile the entire day, the computer might sense some sadness, but not nearly enough to show they are truly sad and that the student shows more happiness than sadness as the time of scanning them.

Lastly, even if this went into effect, this is giving students almost no privacy or security when using a computer. Sure its helpful for learning in some ways, but they have to give the software new emotions like confusion. Even if the expression showing confusion is implemented, this doesn't mean its safe. From paragraph 6, it states: "For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different". Why does this matter? This just gives more excuses on how student's privacy is being exploited. It's also quite useless. You could be thinking of something else besides the ad, but the computer would see that your expression is happy, so you would get a similar ad, which you may not enjoy at all. It just doesn't make any sense to put it in a computer.

This new software is a great concept and could used in many different ways that would be very helpful, but it doesn't seem advanced enough to be put inside lots of computers yet. It's also quite dangerous, since the computer is looking at everything you are doing, inside and now outside the computer even more closely.

Bringing this kind of technology into your lives could seriously damage your reputation, social life, or anything of the like if your computer got hacked. If the software is inaccurate, then when you want to use this feature on a computer, it would be wrong, making this a faulty piece of software, unable to accurately give the emotion you were hoping to give. This could lead to many problems in the future if this face recogniztion software is used in the future. It's just not good enough to be used in the real world yet. Maybe after some time, but as it is not, it's not ready.
