Dear principal,

School is a place for a lot of things. We learn, talk, play, and plan. And when i said plan i meant for the future. Like where we are going to go in life. If some kids aren't so good with their grades and keeping it at a B average or higher, why ex-out a career that they could possibly succeed in? I mean if school wasn't always their passion and if they were always that C average type of kid why would you completely just knock a positive future out of their hands.

Some kids are great in school. They stay on the honor roll all year and get awards at the end of the year. And some kids are ok in school. They keep their grades up to a C and at the end of the year they walk home happy knowing they are going on to the next grade. The kids with the awards has an planned future for himself. He's going to become a doctor whereas the kid with the C' s has a unplanned career. The only thing he is good at is sports, but he cant really show out with his talent because his principal would not allow him to play. Do you want his failure in the future to be because of you?

I know you are probably thinking that if you don't push him to bring up his grades he will never become smarter, but what if his destiny is not be a doctor or a lawyer? What if his destiny is to become a football player or basketball player? He has the decision to bring up his grades or to leave them on his own. Its his life, not yours but his life could easily be influence by your decisions.

So the next time you want to make a new rule, think about how it can effect the lives and futures of others, because you never know. A judge could be in one of those classrooms or maybe even a Kobe Bryant.

Sincerely,
