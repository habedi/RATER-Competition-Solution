The New school policy

I do not like the new school policy of having a B average to attend a sport. I think that a C average is fine. I think it is fine because a C is in the middle of an A,B,D, and F. Also if a kid has a nice amount of B's and struggles in a class and has and F the kid my not be able to play the sport even though he/she is giving there most effort.

Another reason is that the kid my have a bad teacher or a teacher thet he doesn't understand the best and that my effect his/her grade.

If they make a B the average i believe they my be losing a good amount of the kids that play some sports. I think this is unfair to kids who give a lot of effort playing the sport and there grade average.

All in all I think they should keep the grade average of playing a sport a C. If they move it up whats not saying that they wont eventually change it to an A average. I also think there wont be as many kids taking part of a sport. Lastly I think kids need a way to be fit and healthier and taking part in a spot would help that. If they top taking or doing a sport they my become less healthy.
