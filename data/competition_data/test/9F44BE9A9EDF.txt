Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that you shouldn't change the schools policy about having at least a B average because some people are not good at taking test or they forgot to do their homework. It should be at least a C average because most people would have a C average on their report card. because some where out their in ocean of students their is some one who is really good at sports but has only a C average.

If you want to have more people in the sports then you are going to have to keep the grade the same and not change it. If you want more people to be healthy then you are going to have to lower your standards. There will be people that are going to want to make the grades just to do some thing they like or to get in fit for the beach. I know I would because no one wants to be wherein a bikini or swim trunk when they are chubby. You are going to have to not change the grade standards and keep it the same but making the grades when you just be having fun or working out just doing of those things are good because then everyone will be healthy. And the future of America wont have a lot of obese people.

sincerely
