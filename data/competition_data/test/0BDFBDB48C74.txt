Some people think the "Seagoing Cowboy Program'' is a great program. Some people think otherwise. I think it is a great program, it helps people recover their food supplies, animals, and more. The UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. Particapating would be a great way to help out.

My first reason why you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys Program" is because it feels good to help people out who are in need. You would want them to help you if you were in trouble and needed to recover. You would get to sail the oceans, take care of animals, and do other fun activities. It does not get much better.

My second reason is that it changed my life and it could change yours too. It will feel tremendously good to help people recover. It is fun, but you can still make an impact on someones life. As well as taking care of the animals you would get to go sightseeing and do other activities. So all though this is like a mission to help others, it will still be very enjoyable.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. "It opened up the world for me". "I'm grateful for the opportunity." "It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs." "That awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years."

So in conclusion, I would recommend joining the "Seagoing Cowboys Program" because I had a great time, but I still learned a lot and had my life changed. So if you decide to participate in this event, you will not be disapointed. There are many opportunities to help others and many opportunities to have a great time.
