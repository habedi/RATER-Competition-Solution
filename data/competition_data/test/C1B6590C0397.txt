Dear Principle,

I think that the your first choice of policy is a great idea. That's really reasonable for our age, and I don't think you should have any problems, and if problems were to occur then you would just have to settle for policy two, because have gotten their freedom taken away from them.

Most kids are age our pretty mature whether adults like to admit or not, but having a cell phone during lunch period and other freedom acknowledged by teachers time seems fine. I mean, it can't possibly cut into our school work, and if a few people disobey the rule, then they should be punished, but why punish the entire group of teen before they even get a chance to prove you wrong or right?

Honestly, there's nothing that can dramatically go wrong with cell phones being a available at available time. Most guys are showing their friends what new games they've downloaded on their phone, meanwhile girls a taking pictures! What can go wrong with that? And you never know, maybe this privilege will increase students work desire to keep it! I know I'd do good to have my cell phone with me!

But if this policy because such a big problem, then their shouldn't be a problem with just taking it away. I mean, only a few can ruin it for themselves, but if it become a really big, and outrageous problem then you have no other choice but to band their freedom, simply because a few too many decided to do the wrong thing, and they'll have to deal with it!

Besides, we're one of top schools in our county, we never hardly have ridiculous discipline problems, so cutting us some slack or giving us freedom shouldn't be a problem! And a simple cell phone check before entering the class would be so easy and good for these teenagers. I think it'll make things a lot easier on you, then what you may expect! Also, they can listen to music on their phones if they possess headphones. Statistics shows that when you listen to music it automatically helps you learn and think better! But that's enough about how i feel, you're going to do what's best for your school anyway. I just think you should give us a chance to prove you wrong. Well that's all..

Sincerely, a student!
