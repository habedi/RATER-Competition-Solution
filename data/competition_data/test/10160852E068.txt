Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? Most students would agree to do their own designed instead of using the teacher designed because the student can come up with lots of reasons for their project just by learning in a quicker way than other people. Students like me could get in a good mood to make their project entertaining with different images, designs, color and etc. I can think of variety of reasons why i would use student designed instead of using teacher designed. I think using the teacher designed would be way to difficult for most students to understand. Those who state that using the teacher designed is a better choice because its easier to use just because the teacher gave out a easy topic to use but this not true. Although some may disagree, about using the student designed is very bias because they think it should be easy to get the project done without thinking on their own.

Therefore, being responsible of the actions that a student have during their class time with learning on how to do a project and what materials to use for the project can be a big affect on that student grade dealing with that designs, colors and etc they need for their student design project to be done correctly. Students need to take ownership in what they do and become more of a leader so other students can become like the students thats being that leader. Most students have to pay closely attention and follow instructions when the teacher is given out what they have to do because if the teacher assigned a project to do over the break and they do it wrong or they didnt know what to do thats their fault because they should have been paying attention to the teacher while she was giving out the instructions during that class time. As the student think about what they want their topic to be about on the student designed project they always can look up different designs topics on the internet or go look in a design book at different images or quotes about awesome designs.

Even though, the teacher designed project probably have an easier topic and easier thoughts to get through i still think we as students should pick the student designed topic because you can have multiple reasons why you choose that heading and you have a chance to draw what you like to do or see and you can color the images and borders with whatever colors you love to use.

Although, I will agree on choosing my own student design because i love to draw and color things thats what i been doing since i was younger I been wanted to do it for a long period of time especially due to a project thats dealing with animals,sports,cartoons, or anything else that really entertain me. Some students love to do the exact same thing as me because thats the most easiest and interesting part of the project to do. I can work in a reasonable time according to my project topic because i know a lot about certain animals, sports, cartoons, and anything else. Its very easy for me to think what i am gonna write and draw about if i use one of those topics i can guarantee its gonna be an easy task for my teacher to grade. Students should always think of their own ideas and topics before they get home dealing with an individual project that the teacher assigned to do over the break to be finish correctly when we get back to school after the break over with.

In conclusion, i agree students should make sure they choose their best topic dealing with the teacher designed project or the student designed project during the time the teacher had assigned it, because its very easy to do if the student payed attention to the teacher instructions and know what ideas and reasons they gonna have about the student designed project.

Although, some may disagree, about using the student designed is very bias because they think it should be easy to get the project done without thinking of their own but this is not true.
