Dear Principal,

In my own prospective, I think that students should be allowed to use their phones in school and use them during their lunch period plus their free time. Option A is not only fair to the students but to the teachers as well. It gives students more freedom but there has to be some consequences.

If you automatically say that phones are allowed just not in class, us kids are obviously going to take advantage of that. We are going to use them whenever we can. In the hallways, when we take "bathroom breaks", skip classes, or hide their phone from their teacher and text during class. We are going to fight against it but there are ways that you can enforce the rules. In the hallways, phones should not be out during school hours. We would pay more attention to what we are texting rather then looking right ahead or paying attention to our surroundings. It can cause multiple accidents. I encourage for security to be around every edge of the halls and actually get kids to class by organizing the past so people won't be walking on top of each other. And in high school there should be no passes to students to go to the bathroom unless there really is an emergency. A lot of students would cut a part of class just to get to their phone. High school is not like Elementary school. Staff members can't be looking out for every single student in a school. But they could keep them from skipping classes. Security should be going around the hallways all the time to make sure any student isn't just roaming around in the halls. If there is, they should make them go to class unless they have a pass or a note to excuse them from the time being out of class. And the biggest issue of all is students texting during class. Even if teachers say to turn them off and hide them, we are still going to have them out when teachers are not paying attention. And that is an issue everywhere, no one really listens. There is a way teachers can stop it. It's impossible to have an eye on every student, that's why they should dispose of it right before class. There should be a bin where students put their phones. If any student has a phone during class and get caught, they should be the ones getting in trouble. Detention may be too much but just saying that there would be big consequences would really scare them.

I am not saying that doing this would make everything all good. Students these days really rebel against the teachers and the staff. They may not listen the first time but they will get used to the rules and at some point they might have a change of mind. This could make a big difference, make the school a better place, and a better learning environment for those who really care about their education. It could even get the rebels on the right track. Whatever you chose some will go along with, I'm just saying that a lot of kids won't want to go to your school if you don't let student have phones at all and they would really be against you.

Sincerely, a concerned student
