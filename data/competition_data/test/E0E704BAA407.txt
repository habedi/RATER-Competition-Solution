Dear principal

I think we should have cell phones for that if we forget a number and you need it you can get it. Because of the fact that we forget parents number to is a reason for having a cell phone.

That is best for us students. we need cell phones to help us not forget numbers. instead of caring a sheet of paper. you can just get your phone out and go to the contacts.

we should be able to use them when in gym,lunch,and outside. And that teachers keep there phones out and can text call or anything like that we need the same thing.

i understand that some students will get careless and just text and class. that is when it need to be taken up. because you are in class to learn not to text. but we don't learn nothing in lunch or outside. but we learn in health but not in gym playing basketball all the time.

all you do in our gym class is do your exercise and then play basketball or football.

i know it help you learn these sport but that just a class to text or call in. you should not text or talk in a library. because a library is a place of quiet and noise from your cell phone is not tolerated. why you are walking it is not good because you bump into people who might get mad at you. you should not be able to text during crct because you may run out of time and fail the test.

because without the crct you will have to retake and then if you fail you are retained.

All I'm trying to say is that students should be able to use cell phones only in places where is not learning nothing. you know what to do let us use only in none learning places.
