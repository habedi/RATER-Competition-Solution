Do i think the technology is a good value . Yes the use of technology to read a students emotional expression in a classroom to me is valuable in my opinion . For expample in paragraph 6 it say that '' a computer can recongnize when a student is confused or bored'' so why not use the technology to tell if the student is sad or happy to cheer them up or to keep them happy.

Lastly i do think the invention made by Dr. Huang should go further because it will have good use all over the world .

Why, because i blieve it's a quicker way of seeing how someone day is going or how they feel.

This technology can be very useful because in pargraph 6 again tells the reader how it's not only used to look at students to see their emotion it's also used for video games or video surgery .

Finally the use of the figuring out students emotional expression is a good idea because to me its a better use of just asking someone how they are feeling thats why the'' Facial Action Coding System ''

comes in handy because people in general or friends may have trouble describing someones facial traits .
