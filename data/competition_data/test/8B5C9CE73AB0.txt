Fellow citizens there have been an abudnce of incidents that  has happen that involved cars. I prepaired this statement from evidence of these incidents. Nowadays people rely to heavily on cars. dont confuse this statement as me want to eliminate cars .i jus suggest we limit them to a more mangable amount of vehicals. cars can be very reliable but the amount of deaths and car accidents. coupled with the gases cars give off to the ozone layer. limiting them can do so much good and save alot of nations alot of money.

In the streets of VAUBAN Germany there is this experimental  new district . on the outside of freiburg almost in  swiss and french border. VAUBAN streets are completely  car-free. there is a car ownership allowed but only can at large garages. at the border of the complex where only a vehicale owner can buy  a space for 40,000 witch includes a home. as result in this mass vehical rebiltaion 70 percent of vaubans popluation does not own vehiclas although 57  percent own  sold there vehicals to start move there
