Countries like France, Columbia, Germany and USA have took part in reducing greenhouse gasses by reducing if not excluding vehicle transportation. Stats have shown less amounts of carbon in the air and less congestion in imense cities like Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia.

Source two states that Paris typically has more smog then other cities in Europe like Brussels and London. They're taking action by allowing even-numbered license plates to drive one day and have the odd-numbered license plates leave their cars at home and the same would apply to even-numbered plates the following day. Anyone against that restriction would be given a 22-euro fine or 31 dollar fine. That method decreased smog and congestion by 60 percent.

Source three talks about the country of Bogota, Columbia. This town or city has took a big step into reducing gas emisions where not only they participate but other local towns and cities as well. They contribute by leaving their cars home all day for one day to reduce the amount of carbon and smog in the air which helps the enviroment. People hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work. violaters faced a 25 dollar fine. Not only does this benifit the environment but it helps people conversate more with each other. " it's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air pollution," says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

As it is said in source one, " As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here." The small suburb town of Vauban, Germany is home to 5,500 residents were its perimeter is just a rectangular square mile. It is seperated away from all city life where people get around by walking to nearby stores. It may be the most advanced expirement in low-car suburban life. Developed countries or developing countries should think about all the gasses that go into the air and damage the surroundings and take part in to reduce the harmful greenhouse gasses.
