Generic_Name is making the whole school participate in at least one after school sport. Although most kids arent happy with this i certainly am!

I agree that you should participate in at least one activity after school because, its good exercise for you, its only one activity and its a break from watching TV all day and being on your phone.

The first reason you should do an after school activity is because, its good exercise, doing an after school sport can make you a healthy person because of the constant movement and running you do in most sports. For example sumo wrestlers usually lose up to 30,000 calories a day which is insane isnt it. You dont know how much impact a sport has on your health. Another example of sports being good exercise for you is when your constantly at practice in you do drills like running or in ice hockey when you move around back and fourth, or when in wrestling your sprawling and consistently moving. Stuff like that is the best exercise you can get these days. Or even if its not a sport it can be exercise, when your just walking you are burning calories. everything you do burns calories, even breathing.

Moving on to my second reason on why you should do an after school activity is because its only one activity you have to do. Its not like its for 3 hours everyday of the year. Its not a huge birdin you have to do, its probably only like an hour and 30 mins a day or less for only like a season. But if your that lazy just do something simple and easy that dosent last long at all. Then you'll get your one activity you have to do out of the way so you can spend the rest of your year after school how you would like. The only reason i see you can't stay after school for an activity is because your family needs you everyday after school, or you have a little brother to take care of, things like that. If anything it might motivate you to do more activities after school, or join a league outside of school. All Im saying is its only a little bit of time out of your day so dont sweat it.

My Finale reason why i agree you should do at least one after school activity is because it gets you away from your phone. Instead looking on instagram and checking out snap chat. Your in the real world doing something instead of posting a selfie for the internet. While your staying after school to do an activity some lazy guy at home is just playing video games in his basement which is not helping him out, or getting the exercise he needs. Plus one day your not gonna be able to do this. Your just gonna sit in a cubical all day working on stuff and doing papers from 9 am to 5 pm. But you seriously need this because you can't be on your phone or the internet for the rest of your life.

In Conclusion i agree that we all should do one sport or activity after school because in reality its good exercise, dosent take that long and its better then looking at your phone. It wont kill you to do a sport and its not that hard. You'll be find doing an after school activity. Once the season is over for the sport your doing then your done, you've gotten it over with
