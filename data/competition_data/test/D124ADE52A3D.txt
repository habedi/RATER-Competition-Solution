If people started to reduce the usage of cars, there would be a decrease in accadents in the world.  Their would be fresher air to breath, less polution, no more gas prices, and less fat people.  But the down fall is that you can't travel as much or as far as you wanted to.  Millions of people would be out of jods.  Planes, trains, and busses will become overcrowded.  If people stop using cars there would be some improvements on the earth and some disproements.

In large cities without cars you could fit 5,500 residents in a square mile.  It may be what most coutries will change in the next 20 years.  "Due to over population, people with cars could not get to were they wanted to go."  "Stores would be on a main street, (a short walk) thourgh out the city.  Car lanes would be made into bike lanes.

In previous bills (80 percent of appropriations have gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.  People would not have to spend so much money on buying a new car.  Polution would start to drop in days due to no gas polution.  humans would start getting stronger by the week by walk or riding bikes to a destination.

Cars would become something of the past.  Inventers can consentrate on other things like finding ways to explore other planets and to discover new life.  The ice in the South Pole would stop melting and might reduce flooding.  Even if we just get rid of gas and start using electric cars the polution would fall as well.  Gasoline then could be used for rockets to go up in space.
