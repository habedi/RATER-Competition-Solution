For those who believe in Aliens, and believe this face is built by aliens, I have some news, its not and i can argue my point in three different ways. Number one, paragrah 10 sates that if there were anything on the ground the camera would of caught it, number 2 is paragrah 11 talks about the cameras ablity to see anything that would help the research of alien life, and lastly paragrah 7 talking about the natural landform.

First, paragrah 10 talks about the difference of the pictures from 1976-2001 with the different pixels. In the fourth sentence it says " Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo". Earlier in the paragraph it talks about the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, meaning the camera NASA has aren't cheap, they are high quality and could see anything that could resemble any alien life, which will be disccused next.

Secondly, in paragraph 11 it talks about the cameras ablity to see anything on the ground such as shacks planes, as is I said in the previous paragraph with the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, this paragrah also says "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added."So, if there objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground Egyptian- style prymaids or even small shacks, acould see what they were!" Which brings us back to the camera being its best of class,if the camera is able to see anything on the ground that would not be visable to the naked eye, then why didn't it see anythng .

I know most of you would argue that they are storing equiment in the face. But, in the picture the only holes are the eyes and the camera could of seen any other entry point at this angle.

Lastly, paragraph 7 revells the picture of the face on mars, this paragraph talks about the research, and the release of the picture. Yes this eariler in the story but it all falls into place, they state they snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original picture, the image was first posted on the JPL webstite showing a NATURAL land form, no alien momument at all. This dosen't ptove anything since they just posted the picture, but the previous statement i made fall into place with this one supporting my facts of no alien life on the palnet mars asscociating with the face

Concluding my argument of no other life form on mars, I hope I one helped you with your facts, changed your idea of the other life form (not saying you have to). I do not 100% disagree with other life forms but for this one I do.
