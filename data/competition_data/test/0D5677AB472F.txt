The author is supporting this idea very well. Because in the text he is giving many reason on how Venus is our sister planet but a lot hoter than us. In the text they said, "On the planet's surface tempertures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the armospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet.

They came up with so many ideas to go to Venus and take test samples. Example, "Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Vensian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms." It's going to be a very dangerous job to do on the planet. Because they cannot take samples from a distance, they have to take samples on the planet.

It's going to be one of the biggest challenges they will ever have, but if they want to know what it's like to be on Venus, they're going to do it for everyone and the people in this world.
