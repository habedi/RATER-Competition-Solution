Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that it should be required for all student to do community service. I think this because it will keep students out of trouble, it will help them get a good job, and will help them get in a good college.

First, if all students are required to do community service it will help them stay out of trouble. During and after school kids do whatever they want to do and that should not be an option. When they are at school they should be learning and paying attention, instead they are goofing around and not listening to a word the teacher is saying. Also after school kids get into a lot of trouble and don't care about their future. Where if we had them do community service they would realize they cannot do whatever they want and just because your a kid doesn't mean that you cant help your community .

Secondly, i would say that we need community service to be required because if kids do community service it will show up on their personal portfolio. When kids have community service show up on there portfolio it will get them into a well paying good job, rather that having them work in a fast food restaurant.

Third, I think that if students are required to do community service and commit to it they will get in a good college. One thing that colleges look for in students portfolios is commitment and to them it will show that they will stay in college and not drop out and not dropping out of college means you get to get a well educated job and be successful.

In conclusion, If schools require students to do community service it will help them on there future life to come. If they do, do community service it will help them find a good job, keep them out of trouble and get them into a good college. That is my opinion on why i think that all students should have community service as one of their requirements in school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
