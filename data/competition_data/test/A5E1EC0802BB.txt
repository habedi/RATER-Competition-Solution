The "Challenge Of Exploring Venus" is worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents because Venus is nicknamed Evening star because it is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky. For people who gaze at the stars at night can spot the bright light in the sky. Venus is the second planet to the sun, it is safe to watch it from the distance from our world becuase its very far, but going close to it is a challenge.

Venus the second planet close to the sun is a very dangerous planet to get close to. it is sometimes called the earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth too. All the planets move in different speeds, the diffrences in speed means sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Sometimes Venus is right around the corner in space terms human have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped planet. Each spacecraft couldnt land there for more than a few hours, maybe that explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus yet in more than three deacdes.

Venus is made of dioxide blankets, even more challenging ar ethe clouds of highly corrisive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. on the planet's surface, temperatures average around 800 degrees Farenhiet, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet. The conditions are far more extreme than anything in humans encounter. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth such as valleys, moutains, and craters. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment. The NASA is working on getting close to the planet.
