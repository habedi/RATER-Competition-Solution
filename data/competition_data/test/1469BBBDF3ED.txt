Summer projects should beÂ design by teachers and not students

Summer of 2016,the teacher assigned a project to read 5 books over the summer break. As a 6th grader the project seemed impossible to accomplish,but, by the end of the summer,the project was completed. 5 books read and a poster summarizing each book. Through out that same year and the following,reading played an important role in my life. Even though sometimes teachers design projects that may be challenging for a student,teachers know what is best for the students;students may not always know what is best for their learning.

A summer project designed by the students has to be chosen before the end of the school year. The problem is that not all students have the same interests,or the materials needed for various projects. Some students might want to do research,not knowing that others may not have access to internet,a computer or the library. When students design their own projects,they are mostly thinking on a way that will benefit them to get the project done and not thinking about what other students will need. This could affect the students that may not get the project finished do to lack of resources.

If a summer project is designed by the students, they might design a project easy enough to finish in the first 2 weeks,so that they can enjoy the rest of the summer. Students might design a project that does not go in depth. they could also design a project that will not necessarily have to do with what was learn over the school year, moreover,students will not challenge themselves to learn when building their own project. A project that does not challenge the students will never help them learn. The purpose of a summer project is so that students learn over the break.

During the school year,teachers design the projects for the students. Teachers know their students,they know what each is capable of and what areas they need to work on. When a teacher designs a project,the project is chosen carefully. The projects designed by teachers will always challenge students to achieve beyond students expectations to reach their best potential. Teachers will never assign a project that is not in the students abilities.

The student's learning is always in the teachers mind when assigning a project.

In conclusion,some schools require students to complete a summer project that should be design by the teacher. When students design projects,the project will not always be in all the students abilities. Teachers design projects so that every student is capable to work on the project and finish it. During summer brake,students do not want to think about school;therefore,the projects designed by the students might not challenge them and help them learn over the break. Teachers know what is best for the students and they should design the summer projects,so that students can learn and grow even when out of the school.
