Todays society uses automotive vehicles almoat everyday. When they go to work, to go to school, to go shopping, for fun, or anywhere they wanna go. Smog has been building up from the cars pollution for a very long time. Using Vehicles less will decrease smog, improve people's health, an will be better for the earth. Using automotive transportaton less will help everyone an everything in the whole world from humans to the air we breath, from animals to the grass they eat.

However, using vehicles less will decrease the smog amount all around the world. Smog affects everything so decreasing it will help everyone an everything out greatly. Banning cars for a day or bannins odd-numbered plates for just one day would help out tremendously. In  France they have banned odd-numbered an even-numbered plate numbers for one day each on different days. " The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for odd-numbered platwa on tuesday." So even banning vehicles one day can have a huge impact on decrasing smog. An it also clears up congestion on the roads.

However, by using automotive transprtation less it will improve people's health. Walking, skatboarding, riding bicylces, or running will all imrove your health. If you had to go somewhere you could walk there an it would imrove your cardio. If you do this in a large city for one day a great majority of people would participate. "In Colombia, a program took plase an millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work." That would greatly take a impact on the smog ratio. And all of those millions of people who participated got plenty of excersize for the day to improve their health.

So, by using automotive vehicles less it would tremendously help the entire Earth. Smog affects pretty much everything. The air that all the humans and animals breath in is polluted. The air is polluted so it affects the grass an vegetables that animals an humans consume for energy. It affects the trees that give off fresh oxygen so we can continue to breath. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Not driving would take away traffic jams therefore, people would not stress as much an also traffic jams cause a gigantic amount of air pollution so not driving would greatly help the entire Earth that we live on.

In conclusion,  using automotive transportsation less would greatly help reduce smog build up, improve everyone's health, and it would tremendously help the Earth. It would lower air pollution so that the air we breath in would not be harmful to us. Even if we just banned cars for one day the whole Earth would be a lot cleaner. In the U.S the numbers of miles driving peaked in 2005 an have dropped stedily since then. People are starting to drive less and less an it is greatly helping the entire world.
