Dear, Principal

I really don't like that i idea because some people have C' s and they are really good at sports. But i also think that's a good idea because that would make students study more for they can have better grades.

But i don't really know if its a good idea or if it is!!!

Ok i think that its a good idea because it might get students to make a good grade, For a better life. And if they study and they are good at sports that is going to help the in life because they might get a scholarship for doing that.

But I think that right now they have a rule that says that " if you don't have a C or higher that u cant get in any of the sports "

If you want to do that, guess that would be a good thing for me!.. I think that my friends will be ok with it too. I think that with a C we are ok. mostly of the wrestler's have at least a C. And if we change that rule, we will lose many of our good sport people. And we will lose every single game, that wouldn't be a good thing for our school. but i really think that u shouldn't .

I just guess that , well that's my opinion i don't really know what you are going to chose but please don't change it. its going to be issue with some people because they really want to be in sports and they wont be able to!

i sometimes get good grades but if i don't .If i mess up for one report cared i wont be able to get in the sport i want to get in.

I don't really think that I would get lower that a C . its because other people don't get higher that a C. and B is going to be WAY harder to them.

we have fun day! and if we don't get a C or higher we don't go to that! Or if we have a referral, if we get sent to the principals office, or something like that we wont be able to go. Some people didn't go because of the grades. They got lower that a C and they couldn't go to the FUN-DAY!

With care ,
