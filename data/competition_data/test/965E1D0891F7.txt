Phones and driving

Many people follow the rules when driving and many people don't. There can be a lot of safety hazards when you are texting and operating a vehicle. Drivers need to be very careful when operating a vehicle because, they can put people's lives at risk. But, many people do not realize the safety concerns or that you should never use technology while driving.

Research shows that texting and driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst case could kill other people.

While many people are pretty good a multi-tasking, on the road is not the place to put this skill in use. Texting and driving not only requires keeping your eyes on the road but also a combination of motor skills, not to mention that there is already enough going on with traffic so why add the additional distraction. Trying to do too many things at once confuses the brain and makes it difficult to focus on driving and reaction time. For example, imagine driving on a busy road. You are going 65 mph staring down on your lap, as soon as you look up you crash into a car and you kill the person you hit. It would be your fault and you would have to suffer the consequences all because you wanted to text and drive.

Researchers have come to prove that, Cell Phone Use While Driving Increases the Risk of an Accident. One out of 20 drivers use a cell phone when they're in the car, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA). However, doing so makes you four times more likely to get into an accident. Texting while driving is even worse.

In conclusion, texting and driving not only puts your life in danger but it also puts others life in danger. That's why when you drive your phone should be muted. Put aside all the distractions such as phones, loud music and headphones. Putting those things aside could prevent death while driving.
