I think that having to do a after school activity is a great idea. Some might think that they shouldn't but it helps. because it helps in the real world, it helps you be in better shape and it's fun. Those are some reasons, now lets get into deeper detail.

Doing after school activities help in the future, especially if your trying to get a job. They help you with skills you will need to get a job. Like playing on a sports team and the fight to the #1 seed. Helps you because if your trying to get a promotion then you know how it feels to work hard for something that you want. there are also things that can help you get a job like helping take pictures for a yearbook. You could be a photographer.

Doing after school activities also keep you in better shape by keeping you up after school instead of going home and doing nothing. Sports also keep you in good shape by exercises, running and conditioning drills. Also for sports you sometimes have to be fit and well put together so if your not your not making the team.

They are also fun, because for yearbook on school spirit days you get to be out of class taking pictures for people with school spirit. Also wearing your football jersey on a school day makes you feel like your in a high school football movie. It also feels so good to get on the field and make a play. One of the most fun things in sports if not the most fun thing is a bus ride back after a win.

Those are some reasons why I support his statement on everyone should do after school activities. Because they will help in the future, they help you get in shape and they are fun. those are my reasons hope you like it.
