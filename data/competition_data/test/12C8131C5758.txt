My thought on drivless cars is that they can be a help but then again they could cause promblems.

I think driveless cars can help because it could help do things a lot faster, and help a lot with other things. It has some good thing like warning you, help on gas miliage, and drive it self. you really wont have to drive ou just sit and let the car take you by it self.

i think it will make promblems because you wont need alot of gass and if u dont need gas no one will make anymoney because you wont need all of it and there will be alot of oil in the ground beacuse no one is bringing it up because no ones needs it to make gas because of these new cars dont need a lot of gas. It will make more promblems because you dont have to drive the car will drive for you and if the car is driving for you and all you do is sit you will forget how to drive and if something happens and you have to take over you will not know because you forgot how to drive beacuse you sit for so long and let the car drive it self.

My thought on driveless cars can be both prostive and negitive. i think more on the negitive because more people will not have jobs that you have to drive because you dont have to drive because you have a car thaat will drive for u. so i think it can be a good thing that we have them but at the same time a bad thing to.
