You should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It is a very fun program that helps the people of Europe. It is an nice adventure.

This is about helping the people who were affected by World War ll and having an adventure. It is sponsered by the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Admistration). Luke's experience was the best one.

I feel that Luke did get the point of this program, because he talked a lot about traveling and helping. Of course it's alot of work, but it is also fun and you can see new places. Here is one statement that luke stated, "

I had the side benifit of seeing China. Luke was the one Seagoing Cowboy that had made nine trips. That was because he had such a great experience, and you would too if you join this program.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboy program you won't regret it.

Here are some of the benifits that you get, if you are an animal lover you get to work with animals like horses and cows. If you like adventures you can go to places you've never been before. There is a lot of work, but that's not all afterwards the Seagoing Cowboys get together and do fun activites like table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. They also play baseball and vollyball. Come and join the Seagoing Cowbays you would love it there!
