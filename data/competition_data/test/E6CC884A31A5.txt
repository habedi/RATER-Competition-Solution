In recent years, many places all around the world have taken the intiative to lower the use of motor-vehicles, specifically cars, with the intent of decreasing the amount of greenhouse gas being emitted into the air. There are various actions being taken in this attempt, with some neighborhoods going as far as eliminating the use of their cars completely. No matter what actions are being taken, the real goal is to improve the planet and the quality of the air that we are breathing.

As mentioned before, one of the main goals of limiting car use is to improve our air by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases being put into it. If you are driving your car to and from work every single day, and you live in a city where your house/apartment is about 10 minutes away, don't you think you could ride your bike every now and then? Even if you don't have a bike, you could try taking the bus, or maybe even a taxi. By riding your bike, you are eliminating the chance of putting out any greenhouse gases, and by taking the bus, you are reducing the amount of gas being put out.

Aside from improving the environment by limiting car use, you can also improve yourself. Instead of driving your car everyday, you can ride your bike to where you need to go (as previously suggested), and in turn get a small workout. Riding your bike works your muscles, especially your leg muscles, gets your blood pumping, and even reduces stress. If you start riding your bike, you could improve your health and just feel better overall. You can also avoid sitting in a stuffy car and breathe in some fresh air.

In the end, limiting car use seems to have more pros than cons, so it's easy to see why so many places/people have jumped on board with the idea. Even if cars weren't harsh on the environment, they're still bulky and expensive, being more of a hassle than anything else. Why wouldn't you want to limit their use?
