Students are often given projects they don't like, but if they design them they could be a lot more drawn to work on them. Because is break, students shouldn't be working on a project they don't enjoy, they could choose to do a project about something they like. Summer projects should be student-designed, this would make the projects feel more personal.

If students could design their own projects they would be more motivated to work on them. I once was assigned a summer project about whales, a topic I'm not really interested in. I didn't really worked on the project during break and waited until the last week of break to work on it and didn't really do my best on it. If students choose to do their projects about a topic they are passionate about, they will be more motivated to learn more about the topic and work on the project.

Students should design a project they would feel confident doing. Everyone is different and every student is interested in a different topic. My sister was assigned a project about cooking, that is something she enjoys a lot, she finished the project the same day it was assigned. She already knew a lot about the topic but she learned more while doing the project and she felt confident doing it. Students could feel better doing a project about a topic they already know a little and want to learn more about.

The projects they would design would let them have fun and learn while doing the project. I usually have more fun doing projects about topics I like to learn about. I learn a lot more when I'm interested in what my project is about. Usually people learn more when they are having fun because that makes them more interested in the topic. Because is summer break students should be given the chance to have fun instead of having to work on projects about topics they don't really care about.

Having students learn during their break is important, but break is meant to have fun and relax. A project students can have fun doing is what every student would choose. If we let students do more projects about subjects they are passionate about they will be a lot more interested in doing them and will learn a lot more.
