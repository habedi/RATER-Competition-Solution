Dear Principal,

I think that students should not need to have an average of a B or better. A lot of kids that play sports have a C average. I think a B average is a little too high of an average for some students. Instead, I think that kids should have at least a C average. Having a B average is too high for some students because lots of students have at least Bs and Cs. So their average maybe on the lower side of B or maybe a high C. I think that if students get lower than a C average, then they can't play on a sports team. I think that because if they don't try in school then they don't play on their sports team. School comes before sports and if they won't try in school, then they shouldn't be able to play a sport. Playing a sport is an opportunity for students. If it is abused, then it should be taken away from them. Also I think that kids who have a C average or better should be able to play a sport because getting a C is still a good grade. Even though it's not the best grade, they still try in school. But if a student doesn't try and gets lower than a C average, those students shouldn't be able to play. It's not fair to the students who want to play and get the good grades. But I think that the students with lower than a C average shouldn't get kicked off of the team. I think that the student should be able to get back on the team once they get a better grade average. It may take some time, but if they really want to play, then the student will work hard to get their grade up. That is why students should be able to have a C average or better.
