Dear Florida senator,

I argue you in favor of keeping the electoral college in florida. i think it's a easier and better process than popular vote. It seems like to me it would take forever to count all the votes and add them up in all 50 states. our government counts all the votes up anyway but they count them by just it's own state. I feel like everyones voice is getting heard because it counts your vote but it's your states that votes.

The one problem I have with the electoral college is that some states are worth more votes than other states, which in my eyes is alittle unfair but it's our goverment. As florida we have 29 voter points and it's very useful to the running president that they gain our state. maybe if I was in the other states that have like 2 votes for the electoral college, then maybe I would be alittle upset and I would most likely not like the electoral college. It goes by the population of the states which makes sense because we don't want a small state choosing the president. It makes a real good point that the staes don't have the same amount of points, because if a state for example has 2,000 people and the other has 3,000 people, then the bigger population state should have the more electoral points.

If it wasnt for electoral college we wouldn't of had the great presidents we've had like for example John F. Kenndy. John lost by popular vote but won by electoral college. That is our great history and what if the electoral college saved us from a terrible president because not most of them tell the truth and are two faced. But i think electoral college is a great thing for us now and in the future.

Well thats our government and wether we like it or not their not going to change it. If it wasnt for congress and our government, America wouldn't be the same and were thankful for that. I just want to let you know senator that I like and agree with the electoral college . Keep up with all the good work Sir I know we can count on you .

From,
