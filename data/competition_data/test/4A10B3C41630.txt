Some students will be more hard to learn and it will be effect in communicacion skills.

students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home becuase for some students will be more hard to learn. They prefer face to face with a teacher. Not going to school it will effect students communication skills. It will not led students communication skill to growth up beacuse they will not have to many people around them.

Some students will be more hard to learn taking classes from home becuase it will not be a teacher to teach them when they have a questions. some students are more face contact to be able to learn more easily. If you go to school your friend in class can explain you something that you didn't understand but, taking classes at home you don't have nobody to ask for help.

Students can be even asking for help to others teachers. Their are some students that English is not their first language and for thrm it will be more hard taking clases from home.

Students attending classes from home it will be affect their communication skills becuase they will not be able to talk with different person. This can be affect as they are growthing up becuase they will be scared to talk to new persons or to know new people. communication skill is important for everything even at work place and attending to online or video conferencing clases students will not be training their skill.

some students will said that taking online or video coferencing it will be benefit because it can prevent bus accident or car and can save student life , but some stydents are more safety at school them a house. Taking clases from home will not benefit in anything. it just will be destroyed students life becuase they will not be learning how to used their communication skill.
