The school should be able to have cell phones in school.

There should be at least one good and fun thing in school. Students can only have cell phones on in during lunch and during all free time too.

Everyone should be able to use there cell phones anytime though. It is their cell, so they should be able to have it a y time.

Most students have good grades and a cell phone. And in that case, the students should be rewarded some how, so letting the children with good grades use cell phones would be a nice reward, for having good grades. The students with bad grades should be able to use their cell phones once they get their grades up.

I think this hole letting the students have their cell phones in school, would be a good way for the students to get their grades up.

And keep their grades up.

I do not know it will work or not, but it is still worth a try, I guess.

So I say we should just try it for a simple little try.
