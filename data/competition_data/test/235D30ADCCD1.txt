I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. This would be a gret way of futher advancing techology by starting this on the students in the classroom. " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. With this technology being able to read the emotionjs of the student, the it could be able to modify the lesson to further intrest the student. A computer that knows when youre happy, suprised, angry, disgusted, scared and sad sounds pretty cool, right? Most people would say so, this advancement in technology is amazing, but people may not be able to afford it. This would be great in classrooms because most teacher dont know that a child does not get the subject if the child does not say anything about it. With this technology we can help the children learn better and easier in the classroom.
