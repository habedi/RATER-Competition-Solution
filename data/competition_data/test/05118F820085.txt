In may opinion, i think students they can't benefit by attending classes at home.

Because it is going to be so mach difficult for they working at home stading or doing homework by them self and by taking a classes online or video conferencing is going to be mach difficult then taking a class with a real teacher and not on the computer.

Is a lot of distraction at home like children's, noises, and animals so that is going to make a distraction for them so at home it is not going to be a good place for them to study, and student they can't concentrate when they are working so study at home is not going to be a place for student's, and some of the students they don't care about studding thats why they prefer to study at home were no one is going to tel them noting if he don't do homework or study for a test.

Students they can get boring, tired, or angry when they don't no how to do sameting and they don't get help from nobody to do homework or something that they don't no how to do and then they star getting deprecation or headech.

The best way the students can be benefit, is going to school, get help from teachers, learn more then study at home, they can do something different like do sports, playing music, or something that is going to make their future grad.
