Distracted driving

Imagine your sitting at a red light on your way to meet up, and all the sudden you see a teen driver in your rear view mirror on their phone not paying attention and bamm they smack right into your rear. This may seem out of the ordinary but it's happening way too often, with so much access to technology people can't stand to resist the temptation of a simple text which can mean fatal consequences. This is why people should not be able to use cell phones in any way.

Cell phone usage has been on a steady incline, with new and better phones out in the market is letting people have more access to these products. While cell phones are helpful in many ways, they can lead to people taking calls at inappropriate times such as when driving, which can lead to avoidable injuries that can be fatal and could have been avoided by just being a responsible driver. Distracted driving accidents account for almost 25 percent of all collinson crashes. In 2015 319,000 injuries were reported that involved distracted driving.

Furthermore phones were involved in most of these accidents if we raise awareness from a younger age and set good examples for the next generation, we will have fewer car wrecks and pointless death will be less common. These are the reasons why phones should not be used while operating a motor vehicle.
