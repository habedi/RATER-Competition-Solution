Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should approve policy number one, not because I'm a student who wants to have my phone out, but because sometimes we need it and this is why.

First ,how about if we had an accident, how could we contact someone, and wasn't able to go to the office. Like if you fell down and there was no one near you, you could take out your phone and contact some one.

Next ,its free time or lunch we could call a parent to bring us money or food. Sometimes students don't eat because they need to call there parents to bring them something but the office is closed you could just use your phone, and students wont starve anymore.

Last but not least , we wont use it a lot only for the necessary things . Its also free time, and we might get bored ,so we could just use your phone. It also wont disturb anyone and its easy.

In conclusion, I know some people might think they wont follow it and they will text in class, but if you could give us a opportunity we will follow it. and this is why I ask you to pass policy number one.
