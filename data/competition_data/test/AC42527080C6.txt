In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author said studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because of the climate. This is true because if we, humans, decide to go well will be more likely to die than going to mars. Venus is the closest planet in shape and size to Earth, although the Earth and Venus are close to being twins Venus can be a challenge to get close to because of the climate.

On Venus the atmosphere is pretty thick. Almost 97% carbon dioxide and the temperture is 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Don't forget that it is 90 times more that we have experenced here on Earth. This environment wouild destroy a submarine and turn it in to liquid. Although almost exacly the side of the Earth, Venus has the hottest surface in our solar system.

There is stories that say there use to be large oceans on Venus that covered half of the surface where it could support life like Earth. NASA is coming up with solutions to study the planet without sending humans. The built a vehicle that hovers 30 miles or so above the roiling Venusian landscape. Reseachers cannot take samples of rocks gas or anything else that far away. This is why it could be a risk for humans, we need to be up close to study the planet but if we do de might die from the heat.

This is some of the reasons why in "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author said studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
