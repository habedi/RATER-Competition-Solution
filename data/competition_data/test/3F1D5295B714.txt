All students should have to participate in extracurricular activities. The principle has made this a school rule and some people believe that it is a poor decision. They think the students won't have enough time to do their schoolwork, their extracurricular activity, and anything else that they have to do. While others believe it is a good decision because it gives the students some time to have fun in their busy lives. I agree with the principle because it helps the kids make friends, it helps them get involved with the school, and it gives them something to look forward to throughout the day.

The principles new rule helps the kids meet new people. A kid could be considered weird or gross by others but if they were on the same sports team or were on the student council together they might realize that he wasn't weird and that he was actually a good person. Someone may have just moved into the area but doing yearbook with other students could help them make a lot of new friends. Making friends could help kids a lot down the road too. They could become best friends with someone all because they played basketball together in middle school. My best friends are the ones that I play lacrosse with, not the ones that I have classes with or eat lunch with. Making friends is a great reason to make every kid do an extracurricular activity but it also helps kids get involved in their school.

The principles new rule helps the students get involved in so many other parts of the school. If they were to be in the student council or working on the yearbook they would care a lot more about the school then if they just went to school and went home. If they played baseball for their school it may entice them to go watch other sports at the school like football or soccer. It also may make them want to go watch the high school baseball game. I am in the students government at my school and it definitely makes me feel more apart of the school then if I was just trying to get through the day. The more a student does within their school, the more involved they feel. Getting involved in the school isn't the only reason the principle's new rule was good, it also gives the students something to look forward to while they are in school.

The principle's new rule that makes every kid do an extracurricular activity also gives kids something to look forward to while they are in school. School can be boring for a lot of kids and a lot of them wake up and don't want to go, but if they have practice right after school it could help them keep a positive attitude throughout the day. If I know that I have lacrosse practice that day my personality lights up but on days where I don't have anything after school, I get a little annoyed. If a student is in class is getting really bored, they might remember that they have yearbook after school and it could help them focus because they don't want to get any homework and have to do that instead of yearbook. School can be very boring sometimes but if the students have something to look forward to it can help the day go by just a little quicker.

If every student has to do an extracurricular activity it could help the student body as a whole in so many ways. Making new friends, getting involved in the school, and having something to look forward to throughout the day can really help a student thrive and grow in their environment but those aren't the only benefits to making it mandatory to participate in an extracurricular activity. There are many other ways that benefits to the students. Doing an extracurricular activity can help students in multiple ways so making it mandatory is a great idea from the principle.
