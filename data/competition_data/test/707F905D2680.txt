Beep Beep! I've been waiting here for hours! Is what most people are saying nowadays. So many people rely on vehicles for transportation. This means that we can get places faster sure. But that also means there is alot of disadvantges to this as well. I'm going to talk about the advantages of limiting car usage.  A few points i want to talk about are the reasons why it's better to limit car usage. Why it's better for us to not have cars if we have a job near by. The gas will keep getting higher and higher.

The first thing i'm going to talk about is the advantages of limiting you're car use. Every one knows that we rely on our vehicles to get us from place to place. In big cities there are alot of people so that means there is more traffic which backs everything up for hours at a time. This is called a smog. If we all would take a day off from our cars once a week it would make a big difference. It would also help out on the pollution as well.

Another thing i would like to talk about is that we should think about getting rid of our cars if we live in a community. If everything you need is within walking distance why would you need one? People in Germany are doing that today and are doing very well. One person said "When i had a car i was always tense, I'm much happier now." The United States are thinking about doing that and they are calling it "smart planning".

The next thing i would like to talk about is the gas will keep getting higher and higher and the air will keep getting more polluted. "Americans are buying fewer cars , driving less, and getting fewer licenses." So we are making the first step torwards that. A recent study shows that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company said  he wants to create cities in which " pedestrian, bicycle, private cars,  commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time , conserve resources , lower emissions and improve safety". So we are working torwards this but i am sure it will take some time. I know some people will not want to give up there vehicles but the government can just fine them if they drive their cars on days that are prohibited.

So all in all i think we should go through with limiting the usage of vehicles. If we can't do anything at least make more vehicles that are eco friendly to the invironment. I think we should limit car use. Get rid of most of our cars if we live in a community. And that the gas will keep risisng higher and higher do to how many of us need it.
