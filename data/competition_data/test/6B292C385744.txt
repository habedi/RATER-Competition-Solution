Summer break can be fun for students, but is it beneficial to their learning? Over summer break, students often lose information they gained last year, so in response, teachers have been assigning projects to students to keep them engaged with school. Though, it has been called into question the value of these projects, as they are assigned by teachers, so students push them off until the last moment. Summer projects assigned by teachers should be student-designed because it promotes learning about interests, allows for more creativity, and is less work for teachers.

First, The student-designed project often helps students broaden their interests. Over the summer, students might pick up a hobby or interest that will benefit their future. Having the project be student designed could allow for some interesting projects. If a students project is turned in with all sorts of interesting facts, students could be encouraged to pursue that interest in depth, and, overall get a better grade on their project. If a student had designed their project, their project could reflect their interests.

Next, students should design their project, as it allows for some creative ideas. These summer projects are designed to be fun, and allow for exploration, but if all the teacher asks for is a PowerPoint presentation, than it doesnt look very appealing. Now, if a student came in with a computer-designed model of their project, or maybe a song, than they could think broader for next year, and allow for more creativity in the classroom. If these projects were student-designed, than it allows for creativity to be shown throughout their student life.

Lastly, if the project was student-designed, it allows for less work for teachers. If a teacher had to design a project for his or her students, then it could lead to summer stress, and teachers may not enjoy their summer break. So, if students designed their project, all teachers would have to do it assign the project, and grade it at the beginning of school. If students had more freedom with the projects, it would be less work for teachers at the start of the school year.

Teachers and experts often claim that if the project was designed by a teacher, than it would keep a student focused over the summer, and he or she would get their project done sooner. However, this is false because teacher designed projects are boring, and one student or more students will always wait until the last possible minute to get his or her project done. If the project were designed by a teacher, it would bring on more work for a teacher, as they have to assign, design and grade, and allow for more stress over the summer. If a student designed their project, it would be beneficial for all parties involved.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by students because it allows for engaged learning, promotes creativity in the classroom, and, overall, is less stress for teachers over his or her summer break. In our current society, students are more distracted than ever, with cellphones and video games; so, having a student designed project can benefit a student more, as it will not distract as much as a teacher designed. Students should talk to their teachers and administration at their school, asking for student designed summer projects.
