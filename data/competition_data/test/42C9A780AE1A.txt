Fourty-five minutes and counting wait for the traffic to move at least a fraction of an inch so I can tell myself that we're making progress. I can understand 2 minutes, 5 minutes, even 10 minutes but 45 minutes! Might as well turn the engine off. I honestly dont understand why fellow citizens, including myself, just change there life style into a "car-free" one. There are many advantages from limiting your car usage, and I'm starting to believe that I should  take my own advice on that.

Source 1 states that in Vauban; Germany, residents have given up their cars. It's completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram to downtown Freigbur runs, and a couple of streets on one edge of the community. 57 percent of the population mioved there to get rid of their cars. "When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."

Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and most importantly, a mother of two kids rather live in a place without cars. She doesnt ever have to worry about a tragedy were her kids ever getting into a car accident. Vauban, completed in 2006, ia an example of a growing trend happening all over the world, creating a movement called "smart planning". In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather than a mall along some distant highway. It gives us and advanges to buy things whenever we want without having to spend money on gas.

(Source 2) The same thing is happeneing in Europe. Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even- numberes license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same will apply the next day for the odd-numbered  plates that follow .
