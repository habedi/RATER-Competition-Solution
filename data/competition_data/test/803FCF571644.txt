Are principal decided to have all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Lots of students agree with his decision and others do not feel that he is right. I agree with his decision because extracurricular activities put students farther ahead academically and teaches them life skills.

The first reason I agree with this decision is because it puts students farther ahead academically. Doing activities like sports and year book club teaches problem salving skills like thinking ahead that will help student in school. For example, if your in a football game and you decide to change your play after looking at the other teams defense you were learning to think ahead. Also, doing extracurricular activities teaches students to learn from their mistakes. For Instance, if you were part of the basket ball team you could look back on the games you lost and learn how to get better. This helps in school because you could look at a test you failed and find out what you did wrong and how you could get better.

The second reason I agree with this decision is because it teaches students life skills. One skill extracurricular activities teaches is how to work with others. For example If you were part of the year book club you would learn to work with others to Finnish the year book in time which is a useful skill to know. Another reason is because it teaches you that life is not easy and you just have to push through it. An example, is if you were in year book club and you were falling behind you would learn how to get it finished in time. That is a good skill to have because in real life you will not always get all the time you what to Finnish something.

In conclusion, I believe he made a good decision. It is a good idea to have students do extracurricular activities because is puts students farther ahead by teaching problem salving skills and how to learn from you mistakes. It also teaches students good life skills like how to work with others and that life will not be easy. So I believe that are principles decision to have all students do at least one extracurricular activity was the right call.
