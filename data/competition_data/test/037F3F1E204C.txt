Some people may think that it is a valuable thing to have an emotional regontion in a classroom but i dont think it is valuable because then you would be invading someones feelings and thatts not fair. I also think that just because we have all this new and improved technolgy shouldn't mean to use it.

One reason I say it woulldn't be important to to have a facial regontion in a class for students is because maybe the kid is angery or sad and if you find that out then talk to them about it it could bring up bad memories so the kid would eventualy just shut down and not talk at all.

Another reason is that you could trigger some built up anger and then they could cause a bunch of unneeded choas or potentiely they could judt have enough of the bull crap and take matters into their own hands and i'm just saying but it could also cause more school shootings and this point in the U.S we don't need that on our hands.

the final reason is that anymore technology is getting to out of hand in eyes like whatever happend to going outside and having fun instead sitting in frount of a screen play your life away to video games when we could do something to make this world a better place.

Thats why i say that we don't need a facial regonition system to read a kids emotions because it would be more of a big mess then it would be doing anygood.
