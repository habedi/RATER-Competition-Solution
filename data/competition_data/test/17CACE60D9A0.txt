"Unmasking the Face on Mars". NASA took a photo of Mars and what they found would change the world. NASA on 1976 took a photo of Mars, nothing odd right except this odd looking thing that looked like a face. Many scientist thought it was just a land mass that happen to look like a face but the people around the world though of it as an aliens doing.

This idea is wrong in many levels for instant years later they took another photo and it shows that is was nothing but a butte or mesa, but this still did not stop people thinking other wise. What more do they want, we showed them prove and photos that it was just a normal land mass nothing more. The people weren't statisfied though they thought it was just a cover up, yet NASA would be better off if there was , so why would they hide it if they would be better with it.

The idea that the face on Mars was aliens is nothing but nonsense. We really should be doing other things than trying to prove this as true. Does this say that their is not any other beings in the universe no, but this is just a normal land mass found on Mars nothing more nothing less, Or MABEY this is what they want us to think, nahh.
