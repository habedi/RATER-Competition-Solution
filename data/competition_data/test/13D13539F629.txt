Now that we're in 2016 everything is, smater, more inivative, and most of all more technilogical. Driverless cars are a good concpt to me mainly because it ais a more efficiant way of getting around here are a few examples. First example, Driverless cars are cleaner than most public transportation, people who usually take the bus or subway know that public transportation is alot dirtier than say driving. Now that drverless cars are here that can all change. Second example, Many people who are usually tired while driving ccan rely on the car itself to do the driving while they are snoozing, now I know that they still need some human skills to get them going sometimes, but now that technology is advancing that can all be improved in a matter of years. Third and final example, It is more efficiant on the planet than most other cars, in the article it stated that the driverless cars will use half of fuel that regular cars take up. There are electric cars but those discharge very quickly and gasoline cars will damage the planet , now i'm not saying that driverless cars will not run on fuel but they will use half of what other cars do reducing the amount of polluton that is getting spread into the air.
