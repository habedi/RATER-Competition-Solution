Hello TEACHER_NAME, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I have some ideas about whether kids should be required to do community service. I believe that they should not be forced to do community service. I believe they should have the choice on whether they wont to or not. I'm sure that many of them have things that they need or wont to do in their free time. On the other hand though I believe any kids that get in trouble should be forced to do community service as their punishment. This is a good punishment because they will probably hate it and their doing something good for the community. I think the number of hours of community service should be based on what they did and how bad it was. Also, if a kid decides to do community service on their own free will they should receive some sort of gift but they have to exceed a certain amount of hours first. This shows that what they are doing is appreciated. Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
