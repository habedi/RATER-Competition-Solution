I think that is good opportunity for student because some student to need work and do not have time for came to school in the morning, if taking the classes from home have more time for do another things,sometime when we came to school but some student interrupt the class i think can to concentrate in home but too i think is more easy to copy some answer from google,from another people or something like this but i not sure how is taking clases online or video conferencing.

The student who have the classes online or video conferencing is because only have one or two classes to graduate, but neither all schools has this opportunity only high schools. but neither all high chools. Our parent have jobs and wants that we care our brothers this is good because we don't need came to school and we can care; and we can to wake up to late depend what time is the classes. My big sister taking the NOVA online and she say that is more easy because she work in the morning and do the clases in the nigh but she taking the classes only three days for week on monday, wenesday and friday, when i these graduated i try to do my university online too.

My thought is that is good opportunity for student to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing is good benefit, this country have a lot benefit for everybody that came to here especially for student because can learning the lenguage and speak two lenguages here is important. But too i think that all schools need to create this benefit for student but only for student with few classes in high school.
