dear editor,

I think students should have the choice to do community service, or send a letter home to parents asking if it would be ok for there kid to do community service. On the letter you can list options of community service and have the parents decide weather they would want there chilled to do community service, but leave the options of "no i do not want my chilled to do community service." The kids that volunteer to do community service should be rewarded for what they are doing for the community. Like if a kid is forced to do community service that is un-fair for them. If a kid says no i do not want to participate in community service then they don't have to do that it is there choice or there parents choice.

It would not be fair if the principle told everyone that they had to do community service for school. Or if they said no and got in trouble for something that they don't want to do, or there parents doesn't want them to do for reasons un-known.
