Have you ever wanted to travel to another country, but also get a pay check for doing it? If you have ever wanted this, then you might want to consider becoming a Seagoing Cowboy or Cowgirl.

We get to work with many animals. Our job is to swifty transfer animals from one country to another. We have to take care of all the animals. Some trips can have over a hundred animals goin from one place to another, but you'll get to feed, water, play with, and care for all the animals.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to travel all over Europe. I made nine trips to different countries and had extra time to tour famous sites such as the Acropolis in Greece and

I took a gondola ride through the watery streets of Venice, Italy. You'll be able to go to Italy and Greece too, but you will also be able to go to China and Panama.

The job of a Seagoing Cowboy is very safe and will most of us will likely return to our families after our war service is up or we retire. A Seagoing Cowboy also dosen't have to fight on the battle field during wars. If they are drafted, they just pay their service by doing their job like i did. We help struggling countries to recover after wars, so we are already doing their war service.

If any of these benefits appeal to your interests, then you might want to sign up to be a Seagoing Cowboy along with me. It's a safe, interesting, and all around enjoyable job.
