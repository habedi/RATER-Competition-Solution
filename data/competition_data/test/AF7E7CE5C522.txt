Limiting care usage may be quite a inconvenience, but it can be a really great advantage in the long run. Plus there are better alternatives to automobiles that work just as well such as trains, buses, taxis, and even bicycles. Not only are they better for the environment, but they can be used to live a happier lifestyle. Overall it leads up to happy citizens, and cleaner air. In fact cleaner air is so desired and necessary that some countries, including the U.S., are now turning it into law.

Over in Vauban, Germany, most residents do not own cars, and alternatively ride their bicycles wherever they may need to go. The way that they made this possible was making sure that there were only two places to park - large garages at the end of the development. Even more efficiently added to this inconvenience to car users, a car space would cost forty-thousand dollars along with a home, and as a result, only 30% of Vauban's residents own cars, and 57% of people sold their car to move to Vauban. Some places are even going as far as having a car-free day, such as in Bogota, Columbia. On this day it is not permitted by law to drive a personal automobile vehicle.

Which brings me to the subject that many countries are now putting the practice of fining people for driving into law, rather than a one day event. Over in Paris, with a near-record pollutuion rate, people are fined for using cars by license plates, meaning on Monday a motorist with an even-numbered license plate would be fined 22 euro, whereas on the following day this would apply to odd-numbered license plates. There were exceptions to this however for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This impacted delivery companies, and caused them to complain due to the fact that this caused them to lose revenue, but according to the article (in my understanding), nothing was done about it.
