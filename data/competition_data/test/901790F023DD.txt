Summer Projects

Public school years are designed to give teachers and students two months off as a summer vacation. Many do not like this format. They think students forget too much of the material they learned over the school year. To combat this, schools are starting to introduce summer projects. These projects are designed to maintain the levels of education students have received. However, schools are having trouble introducing these projects. They can not decide who should be able to design them. Some think teachers should, while others believe students should. Students should design their projects in order for them to get the most educational value out of the assignment.

Summer is a time for students to sleep in and be care free. Many do not like the idea of completing a summer project. They think that their freedom is being taken away. Allowing students to design their project will increase their motivation. Most of the time, they will have chosen a topic that interests them. The project will not be put off until the end of summer. Being interested in a subject sparks a need to learn more. They will constantly want to learn more about the subject matter. Each new fact will increase the complexity of the project. The knowledge gained from excess research will provide a basis for their next year in school.

A student that voluntarily researches has more than just motivation. They have a thirst for knowledge. This thirst will motivate them to put more effort into their projects. The effort they put in will help to create a substantial project. The knowledge they gain will not disappear. It will be engraved in their brains for years to come. Each project will help them to learn time management skills and organization strategies as well. These skills will help students grow as individuals. They will help students be successful in college and in their lives after school.

Sometimes students are busy. Those that are involved in sports and clubs, and might not have a lot of time to complete a summer project. In this case, they can choose a project similar to a classmate. The two students will be able to make the project easier to complete. They are able to coordinate with each other, and split up responsibilities. They will have to do two separate projects, but the work will not be as hard. They will also learn how to work together as a team. Learning how to share responsibilities and be a team player will also help them in their lives after school. Careers require teamwork skills, hard work, and reliability.

Although letting students have control over their projects would keep them interested and motivated, some worry that the project might not have the right educational value. Letting teachers design the project will ensure the students are getting the right amount of learning. The rubric and content will be specific to certain classes or subjects. Teachers can make sure specific subjects are being covered if they are responsible for creating each project. The projects could also prepare students for upcoming classes. They will learn basic knowledge needed to be prepared for higher level classes. The project could prepare students for the future school year.

Schools that have implemented a summer project are trying to prevent loss of knowledge. During summer, students forget a lot of the knowledge learned from the previous school year. Allowing students to design their summer projects will help reduce this loss of knowledge. They will become more motivated, learn more about the subject they are interested in, and learn valuable life lessons. Letting their teachers design the projects will guarantee educational value, but the students will benefit more from choosing their own. No one wants to be forced to complete something during their free time. Students that choose their own project will not look at it as an assignment, but as a time to learn more.Â
