In my opinion yes and no, I am agree and desagree that the sudents would benefit a lot if they take classes from home. There are student that likes to do what is better for another ones not.

There are so many reasons why.

RESPONSABILITIE

WEATHER

PRESSION

SOCIAL MEDIA

ACCESS TO INTERNET

Othe thing it should be more easy to take being able to attend classes from home than being in school. The responsabilitie of attend should be more but more confortable becuase is in home. The attandence from the ones than does not like to came to school will increase or from the ones that loves to skip just because they do not like to being in school.

One of the main reasons is the weather, sometimes is because of snow, rain and there is too cold schools are closed. There is so dangerous to the busses, to the ones who drive or who walk too. The streets are so smooth. So the students who walk can hit them selves if the slide. When it is raining the streets does not look very well and is almost the same with the snow, the cars get slide.

Taking classes in home online or by conference should be more easy than came to school. The students just take the classes in bed just waking up with a alarm. Attend should be good responsabilitie in a very good way. Maybe doing homework should be good too. If they put a penalty when the students not connect would be a good idea. Like when they put the detention when they do not came to school. It would be almost the same thing but more confortable because is in home. The parents would not be that worry if the kids are in school or not. Maybe they will have more to do things. Getting all the staff online should do a really big difference. They should be able to attend all the time with out worry if they get late or miss the bus.

There are things that does not benefit to the students, becuase if everyone is agree with that what is going to happen to the ones that does not have access to internet in home. That is not going to be for benefit for others. Not all of us have access to internet and they prefer to go to school because of that. I do not think that schools is going to provide internet just to take classes from home.

Other Unbenefit thing can be if the ones who are giving the conferences do not explain good everything and we have questions and the time is short, we are not going to understand everything and when the quizes came we are going to fail. The classes are not the same as schools, we provide the teachers like after school seccions with them so they can explain us what we did not understand.

Other thing about it is if the students are doing bad, the online session is not going to notify. In school we provide the services of the counselor, after school sessions or tutoring. The students are not going to have all of that in home. It can be a good responsabilitie to take in home but there are student that are so lazy to take classes they prefered to do another things than taking classes, there is a lot of technoligy that there is ruinig so many of the teens. A lot of social media that we prefer to being looking and checking all that staff than taking the classes. In school the teachers, securities are there to say what is good and what not. In home they are going to do what they want.

I think the last 2 grades of schools should take the classes from home, because they already know what they want to do. The teachers from schools should take more attention to the others grades to get them ready from when they are going to take the ones online.

The teachers from schools can talk about it in the conferences that they have to assign online classes to the students who they think is going to handle it and is going to have the responsabilitie to take it. I know that the ones that are sick or have other thing can take online classes and it is benefit to them. If they fill like a application maybe that will work too saying the reasons why they want to take the classes online, if the County aprove them they can take it.
