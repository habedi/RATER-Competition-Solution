The author supports the idea of studying venus with ahuge ammount of facts. like that venus use to be able to hold life like eartdid or that its super hot and too hot to put anything from earth on beacsue it will melt but personally i think that the author had no point in what he worte. he made it clear that no one can with stande 170 degree temperature and that no metal is gping to be able to withstand the heat either. so with that temerature no human life and no robot could go to venus. right? no. the author also made it clear that venus was like our twin and it use to have charestics like pur plant.

From the water covering the planet to the air. but now venus has a thick aptmosphere and we could never live on venus. that not the only reason though there is no water source its to hot and we couldnt breatth beacsue of how this the aptmosphereis in venus.

We nor no animal could withstand the heat on venus but the author argued that we could but in all reality we couldnt and it sint even a smart idea NASA is putting money into to something that wont worl and its pointless beacus eit 170 degrees and no one wants that. wed die. metal will melt and until we come up with non melting metal no one will live on venus
