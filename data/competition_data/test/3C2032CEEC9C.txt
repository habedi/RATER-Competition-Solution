If the students,would assist to class when they're in their home using video conferences or be online i dont think well be a good idea because the students would no be doing that. Because if they're lazy or they don't have how to go to school why they won't assist to a video conferences and been in the computer for a class. I dont think, the students would be studying well it won't be a good method of studying, and the teacher would not be there, literally helping the students teaching them how to do their work. The students can cheat in their work from class and then they would not learn anything what the teacher teach to him and to the students, and the teacher would not be able every time to help them in their work because, is a lot of students who need a lot of help sometimes, and i think the teacher would be busy with the other students. and the students would not assist to class because of that things.

The students need to learn about education and society because if they don have that in life after school would be hard to improve because they don't know how people can be,or maybe they wont like how their teacher are teaching them because they have ones in the computer in online they dont really know the teacher or whos teaching them or if its correct how they are teaching them because if you dont understand the teacher there is other teacher who can help you with it and solve your problems in school you have and like in my country you think school is your other house and the teacher are like you second mothers because they are teaching you like you parents teach to you

One time i was in a online class doing a video call and, the teacher wasn't there sometimes when i need help in my work. And it was like ten people in my class, it was very distracting because, everyone was talking at the same time in the video call. And i couldn't listen well to the teacher. Then i didn't learn well because she was busy. This was in summer school, it was just one month but in my opinion i didn't learn that much i learn more when i was in summer school but in a class room with the teacher and the students in side.

Must of the times their was students they would not there sometimes, and it wasn't like one or two sometimes was more. And the calls wasn't that much of stressful because it wasn't that much of students. And you can learn much better with out them because the teacher has more time for you. the students when they don't go to the class room in school must of the times is because, they don't like how the teacher teach to them but thats a really big problem. Some teachers know you skip their class or others, they don't want to explain you because the student is not there must of the times but the students need to learn in life some times you don't choose your things, like know in school your counselor can help you whit it, change the student with another teacher but when they go to college they do not have that option.

I don't thing is a good idea to have the classes online because when you go to school you learn about responsibility. And how you can improve in a good way how you are, how responsibility you need to be in life, have respect with other people, with your teacher and the other students. You can improve something you want to be after your done with school, like if you are good with society, you can learn in school that you can be a person who likes to talk a lot and you can choose in your life to be a reporter and in school they're programs and classes you can choose, so you can learn more about it.

For been in school you make your life, your own decisions of what you want to be in a future. Find your hobbies your passions. You can make friends in school you can be in contact with them in your live. Know new people from other countries learn about their culture how their are. How people can be in different forms of attitudes and different types of people are in the world.

The programs of the schools at home are not good for people who likes to be in society wants to learn about other stuff, learn of how is society. You can learn about math,science,sports,everything you want but i think learning at school is a better idea for those people wants to really learn what they want to be. Thats why schools are for help, teach and have learn about education for your future.

In my conclusion, for me classes online is not a good idea i don't think students would be benefit being to attend classes from home because is not a good for them. If people lives far away from their schools or they dont have who can take them the Government or the community of the schools should still sending buses to pick up those students. They need to make a solution how students can came and have education. Because education is important in life and been in school it is great. Their is programs of school in house but i dont think is a good idea we need to be in society, we need people who can help us at the time we need, like in the class room teacher know how to teach to their students they studied for that. And going to school you have programs clubs if you like to be helping, studying, or doing sports, and know new people,learn things you even't know about it, or improve your self for you or for your future. Classes online, if is just you and the teacher i think it would be good but still a problem their is not a lot of teachers can teach to every single student,and the students they won't know have a social life and know new people.
