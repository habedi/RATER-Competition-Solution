Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Kids love to have fun, they don't want to be forced to do community service.

They want to enjoy life by doing things they want to do, not by what people tell them to do. I'm totally with you on this one though, I believe kids all over the world should participate in some kind of community service. People should always give back to the community and by making kids starts now will increase the chances of them doing it in the future.

There are many different ways you can give back to the community. For example volunteering somewhere is a form of community service. Sometimes you don't even have to do that, it can be as little as helping a neighbor on yard work or picking up trash in a neighborhood. You can make volunteering fun to. For example you can organize a program at a local church to raise money, there can be food, refreshments, sports, games, and activities.

In all I believe all people including kids should give back to there community. It shows respect and care, and it shows that your thankful.
