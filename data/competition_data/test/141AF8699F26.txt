In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangerss it presents. I used the detsils from the story to evaluate how welll the author supported his/her idea. In the article the author didn't really supports the idea the venus is a wothy pursuit despite the danges it presents. the auther gave te the readed more evidents supporting the idea that Venus has too harsh conditions to studying.

in paragraph 3 it stares off by sayin that Venus atmosphere is almost 9 percent carbon dioxide. than it countines to say "even more challenging the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmoshere." all those facts tells the reader how dangeros it is on Venus. "on the planet's suface , trmperatures average over 800 degreees Fahenheit," that tells us that it is wat to hot on Venus to do anything on it. In paragraph 4 the author said that a long time ago Venus was probabl covered with oceans just like Earth. The author did not suppor the idea Venus is a worthy pusuit.

All and all the author and a lack a evedence to support the idea venus is worthy purusit despite the danger is presents. the author and more details to suppor that Venus it not worth it. the author did not do a very good job in supporing their claim.
