How many times have you wanted to stay after school for an extracurricular activity, but all of your friends went home? The principal is trying to publish a rule that says that you must participate in at least one after school activity, therefore you will always have a friend to talk to. The type of programs that the school will be providing will include participating in sports, the yearbook, or even being a part of the student council. There will also be a lot more fun and new activities introduced that you can enjoy independently or with a group of friends while staying after school. Participating in one or more extracurricular activities can also be good for your mental and physical health, by staying active and playing sports, or being a part of a club that requires socializing with new people.

There are many extracurricular programs that can improve your physical health by participating in athletic activities, and help your mental health while doing enjoyable activities. Participating in at least one extracurricular activity can help a person so much more than you could imagine. Studies have shown that people that participate in school activities are known to be happier and more energetic in their every day lives, because of the great impact staying after school has on you. In 2017, a middle school in New York, had more than 25% of the students suffer from social anxiety. This school didn't give students the opportunity to stay after school until the year of 2019. Due to adding this opportunity, the social anxiety rates of the students were drastically decreased, because they were able to participate in an after school activity that helped them become more social and make friends easily. Staying after school will give you the opportunity to meet a lot of new people that might have the same interests as you, socialize with them, and become good friends in the future.

Participating in an extracurricular activity can also benefit your grades and help you become more comfortable in your school's environment. There are a lot of interesting activities that the principal and the school board have come up with that have helped students perform better in school. Most of the academic clubs include being able to work on homework, study with a teacher, or turn in any missing work. The physical activities include, basketball, soccer, football, lacrosse, volleyball, and baseball. A lot of new clubs have been added from the previous years and multiple of them provide mind games and board games. A new club that the high schools in the county have started to provide is the video game club, which has shown to be the most popular one. The video game club will allow people to play the electronic games they like, while interacting with other people. The mind game club have helped multiple teachers figure out the way their students think and have helped them improve the way they teach to benefit the children's learning skills. A lot of the physical activities have also been statistically known for decreasing a child's depression rate, due to the interaction that kids have while participating in a physical extracurricular activity. Physical activities help the brain process things faster and more clearly, so the reason that the depression rates have started to decrease is because participating in sports brings joy to a person, and that has a greater impact on someone's mental health, than the physical health of a person.

In conclusion, staying after school for at least one extracurricular activity, can be very fun and enjoyable, it can help improve your grades, and it can also help teachers understand the way their student's think. Staying after school can also make a drastic affect on your social life, help your physical health by participating in sports, and most importantly decrease social anxiety ratings.
