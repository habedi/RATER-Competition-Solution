I think others should join the program because you could help these countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more. Caring for the animals is a big job too they have to be watered and fed two or three times a day. Also many things need to be picked up like bales of hay and bags of oats. This is a really big thing to people to have our help. It is a good idea to try and help out.

I have experienced from my aunt Katies farm as a young boy, I worked very hard so that prepared me,but not for the dangers of the sea. My job is to cheak on the animals every hour,its not all that bad. One night though it was pretty scary i was making my hourly report to the captain and some things happened. It wasnt that bad but im glad im here today. There is also lots of time to have fun on board. Like on return trips when the animals had been unloaded. I also played volleyball and baseball games with the cowboys in empty holds.

These are the many reassons why i think others should try joining the program. You not only have to work, you get to have fun while working with others. It may sound scary but its not,once are used to it. It feels pretty good to get that kind of offer. Also just to be able to help out.
