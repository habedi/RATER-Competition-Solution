When NASA found the Face on Mars, conspiracy theorists were sure that it was created by aliens. NASA did research and found out that the face was not what everyone thought it was. NASA found that the Face was just a natural landform. NASA knows that it is a natural landform because they took a close picture of it, and we have natural landforms just like it on Earth.

Lots of people thought that the Face on Mars was bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Those people say that NASA would hide information like life on Mars from the public instead of telling the truth. Even after being shown evidence, the skeptics were not satisfied. They said that the alien markings may have been hidden by the haze on that day.

When NASA took a picture ten times sharper than the original picture, it revealed that the Face was just a natural landform, not an alien monument. The picture shows that it is Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The landform is quite similar to landforms on Earth around the American west. The skeptics still didn't believe NASA. To satisfy the skeptics NASA took another picture with maximum resolution on a cloudless summer day. It again showed that the Face is only a natural landform.

The Face turned out to be just a natural landform afterall. Although skeptics believed that there was something that NASA wasn't telling us about the Face, NASA had proof that it was a natural landform. We know that the Face is a natural landform because we have landforms just like it on Earth and we have proof with pictures. Although the Face could have turned out to be the discovery of life on Mars, we had to face the facts and realize that it was just a natural landform.
