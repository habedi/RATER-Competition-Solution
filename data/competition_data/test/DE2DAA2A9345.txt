Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Our sports teams are already small as they are with the failing grade policy.

With the new change in policy the teams will shrink dramatically unless the grades rise of the athletes.

However that is not a safe bet because the average grade is a C and averages are hard to raise.

Even though I am not on a sports team I am still writing this to help our sports teams be better with grades and sports.

If this grade plan falls through it will possibly not only destroy our sports teams and their records but possibly cause chaos in the academic field. It may because the athletes need to blow off steam or give them exercise to not only their muscles but also the brain.

There is even science that proves that exercise helps development of a healthy and strong brain.

Now that does not say its useless.

A better plan of action for this would be having weekly grade meetings with the coach.

Then the next step is having the parents actually get up and check on the grades of their children.

Another step and the most important one is if the child or children have a lot of homework or work the parents will enforce the law of whether or not the child stays home and studies or goes to practice.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
