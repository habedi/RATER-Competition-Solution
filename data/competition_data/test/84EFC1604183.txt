Have you ever wanted to go outer space? Well I have, but what this excellent passage is telling me about Venus is making me change my mind. I never knew how dangerous the solar system was until I read this passage about the Earth's twin Venus.

The author that wrote this passage had very good support to support his passage over Venus. The author told us about how Venus is very dangerous but is a very intersting planet to study . Also, he told us about how about the features and the history about Venus. The author suports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that Venus have. The author supports the idea very well because he added facts. Also he did very well with suporting his claim because he have good look passages. also he states that, "Also notatable,Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closest to the sun". So this means that Venus is dangerous even if you go to it is too hot to even step foot on.

In conclusion, studying Venus is an worthy Pursuit because you can find alot of facts and statistics about Venus. The author states that " Venus, sometimes called the "Evening star," is one of thr brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer. So, this mean Venus isn't just an planet it aslo is an eveaning star. I have went through all the evidence that the author excellently supports his idea.
