I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. I think this because if a student is having a hard time in class and is stressed out, or even getting mad the teacher can help them.

The first quote that supports my claim is "Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of mona lisa." This quote supports my claim because it tells what the facial action coding system can do.

The second quote that supports my claim is "Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc." This quote supports my claim because this quote is saying how some people might not be able to tell what someones emotions are so the facial action coding system could help them do that.

The last quote that supports my claim is when Dr. Huang predicts "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This quote supports my claim because Dr. Huang says that it could help recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

If a student is having a hard time in class and is stressed out or even getting mad the teacher can help them. I believe this to still be true and maybe one day the facial action coding system will help us in the class room or anywhere all over the world.
