Dear Principal,

Having cell phones in school isn't a good idea. They provide distractions, ways to cheat on assignments, and they could get stolen, lost, or ruined. Having cell phones at school can cause many problems.

They provide a plentiful amount of distractions. Students could be texting in class and not be paying attention to what the teacher is saying and it will affect test and quiz scores because students will not know what they are doing since their cell phone had their attention, not the teacher. If a cell phone starts ringing in the middle of class, the noise will distract other people in the room. Other students might know the song that is being played and start singing along and being obnoxious with it. A cell phone would also be a nuisance to teachers because if it is out while they are teaching, they have to confiscate them and it takes away from the time they have to teach.

Cell phones could mean cheating on assignments because another student who has already taken the test and knows all of the answers could text the answers to someone while that person is taking their test. A student could put the answers into their phone and look at it while they are testing. Students could also pass the phone with answers on it around to everyone else taking the test.

Cell phones could get stolen and cause fights. If someone who owns a phone leaves it for just a second, another student could take the phone. Then, the student who's phone was stolen could figure out who took it and get upset with the other person, possibly even causing a fist-fight. If someone's phone gets lost, parents could be very upset at their child. Also, students could have fights, oral and fist, about who's phone is better.

Students bringing phones to school and being able to use them is a very bad idea and could hurt the school by rupturing grades and the students themselves. Bringing cell phones into schools shouldn't happen, and I hope you see why.
