Sports

A B C! Who can keep track? The principle would like to know whether to change the grade age to B instead of C! That is outrageous! Some kids try as hard as the can to get a C, they make it and are so happy, now they can try out for the basketball, football, softball, or the track team!

Now the principal is trying to raise it to a B!

Some kids have a more difficult time learning math, science, or English. Like me, I have trouble in math more than others, Its not because I don't try, I do I really do. I just don't understand math! And for some kids its even harder for them than it is for me. Three reasons I think the should keep it as a C is, its a passing grade, some kids need more help than other but just cant get it, or that the kids could get a scholar ship off of there sports!

C is a passing grade and it will still get you through high school. It may not get you into the best collage but it will get you through high school. C is only a little ways away from a B and maybe it they were on the team, they could get the encouragement they need. Some kids may not shine in school, but some shine is sports, some people use sports as a way to relax and unwind. Taking away kids way to relax just because they have a C shouldn't be right.

When kids get C' s it usually means they either don't want to do the work or just don't get it. Like I said before some kids just have a harder time with the subjects.

Just because some kids don't get it as good as they should we should take away there entertainment, and way to relax?

Kids can get scholar ships off of sports! Do you really want to take away the chance for them to have a better future by making the sports grade a C? Well you shouldn't! Your taking away the chance for kids, that might not be very good in school but shine in sports, the chance to help them pay for a collage!

In my conclusion I hope you will take that under consideration as to why you should not raise the sports age to a B instead of a C! Please see reason, don't take away kids ways to relax and unwind!
