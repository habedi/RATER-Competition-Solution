Fellow citizens cars are dying out. Every year more and more people are realizing the cultural and natural impact that cars are having on us in a negative way. There are many advantages that come with eliminating cars from society. For one reason is that we can start to eliminate roads and highways and use that land for houses or something else. Another reason is that it will help the world out in a natural way to stop tempatures from sky rocketing to completely melting the polar cap, and prevent smog from building up in dense cities. Citezens also wont have to spend money on fuel or a car anymore and can save money.

As soon as citizens completely wipe out the use of cars then alot of positives will result out of it. As soon as cars are out of the picture then societies can use up the space from highways and roads to make houses and shopping centers that are walking distance from those houses or living communities. When people need to drive long disctances to get to another destination thats far away from where they live then they can take theyre car thats on the outskirt of the city in a protected garage, just like they do in Vauban, Germany, they do this in order to keep the city within completely safe and pollutant free from cars.

Up to now and ever since the invention of automobiles like buses and cars the world has changed dramatically in tempature. Earth has become like a microwave just trapping heat from the Greenhouse effect which causes the carbon dioxide from the cars to stay in earth andn not expell to space which has caused some of the highest tempatures in the last 100 years. With the elimination of cars less carbon dioxide will be let out causing the eart to cool and thus will help save the polar ice caps. Not only will it save the cold areas of the world but it will also help reduce smog in densley packed cities like Paris and Bieging. Up to now cities like Paris and Bogota have had certain days where they prohibit the use of cars in the city to help and calm the smog down. This Method has helped dramatically and it was only for one day! Imagine what doing this forever can do for the enviroment.

Another topic for eliminating the use of cars is the economic change it will postively have on the enviroment. For one families wont have to spend money on gas. Second they wont have to spend money for a car. Last but not least third they wont have to spend money on tolls or tickets. So simply if you dont have a car you wont have to worry about any of those problems. Families can use all of that saved money for going on vacations or on themselves.
