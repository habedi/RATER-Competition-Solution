Dear Principal,

I feel that cell phones are a pleasure to have and that shouldn't be taken advantage of. Sometimes you have a big emergency and you need to contact a parent. Not being able to use them during class time is a good idea, and if someone is caught you need to take there phones away and deal with that particular situation appropriately. Free time should include lunch time, before school and after, or when using the restrooms, and during a time if we are in the library. I think you should consider letting the students use their phones.

Most students would agree with me that they should be used, not to text everyone but just in case you ever needed to get in contact with someone important. Pictures could be a standard that you could set to not allow students to take pictures while in or on school properties. Cell phones should be collected during class time. Students should consider these rules, this is a privilege not a necessity. Once the rules are set into place and students keep getting caught with their phones you need to change the rules back to no cell phones, but I feel that it would never happen.

I feel that you should rethink the idea about having cell phones during school hours. Also if something happens in your family you could be notified right away with a simply text message. While many people already take advantage of the cell phones anyways some students would honor your decision on letting us use our cell phones. I truly believe that if we were to get the privilege to use cell phones that everyone would understand and go by the policy you set for us.

Sincerely,

Your Students.
