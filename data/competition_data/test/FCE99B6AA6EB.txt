"Hello, I am Luke Bomberger, I have traveled across the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the pacific twice, I have helped people affected by World War II. I was part of the Seagoing Cowboys program and i am here today to encourage and convince you to Join this amazing program." I said infront of quite a few people in the town hall.

"Why should we listen to what you have to say?" said my enimie who ran his own program that did exactly what the Seagoing Cowboys did. His name was Jack Linington. He was walkiong on the stage questoning my program. I got furious but i held it in.

"You should have to listen to what I say because what I have to say is important and can help people around the world who have been affected from war." i said back. "So what, my program is way better than yours" said Jack. At this point half of the audience was questoning my program and the other half was yelling at Jack to get out.

"How is yours better than mine we both do the same thing. Can't we just put this feud to an end?" I asked.

" No, people don't listen to him or let him convince you to join his program, instead join mine."He protested.

" Please Jack join my program and let us be friends not enimies" i insisted.

Finally, he broke down and--" Yes, yes i will, ill join your program" i couldn't beleive it he acually wanted to be part of the program! The feeling was a rush i acually softend him and we became friends.

I talked some more and when everyone left they all took a packet. And Jack and I are now not only partners,l we are friends.
