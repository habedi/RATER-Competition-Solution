Dear Principle

We the students think that the B average rule is wrong.

Other's also agree that this rule is unfair to those who have a low average. We think that if you would consider changing it to a C average.

Most kids like to join in school sports also with the kids who don't have B averages and were in school sports would mean they would be kicked out and possibly leave the school meaning less students also meaning the school would be forced to shut down due to low population of students. We would like for you to consider thinking about a better opportunity for not only the kids but the school too. Also if your thinking this might not happen ask the students. They will tell you a better way to improve the school in reasonable ways. Ideas from kids just like me and students can help me today and tomorrow a brighter day. We the students think this would be a very fair and equal way to improve all schools society and surroundings in a way to bring to school chilren ready for class and excited to come. Thank you.
