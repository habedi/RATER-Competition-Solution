Dear Principal of the school,

I'm writing you this letter to confirm which policy would be better for our school. I myself, prefer the 1st policy because it allows students some responsibility to turn of phones during class time and allowing them to have it out during free time and lunch. Some students need their phones to call parents if anything happens or if they need them to pick them up from school. If any student is caught with a phone during class time then the phone should be confiscated as a result in the consequence and be may be returned to the owner after school.

To begin with, Policy 1: allowing students to bring cell phones to school and using them during free time or lunch but turning them off during class time, would be a better choice. Some students need their phones just in case the parent needs to get a hold of them for emergencies reasons or other important reason the parent may need to call and check on their child or other reasons.

Next, students may use office phone if necessary but, there are some incidents where students need their phone in case they need to tell their parent something and the office phone is being used or isn't working at the moment. You may be worried about students having phones out during class time because that could prevent them from learning important subjects. If that is the case and the student(s) have their phones out during class time then it will lead to a consequence.

In conclusion, policy 1 would result in a lot more happiness and students will more likely obey to the rule. I may be speaking for a majority of the students that policy 1 is better for ourselves.
