When you think of summer projects do you think of fun,active,joyfull times and eciting learning? When you think of a teacher asigning a summer project you don't think of it being eciting. You think of restricted activies,rules,and limmited time. These characteristics might even take away from a student wanting to do summer projects. This is why I stongly agree that students should design the summer project because they have the right to do what they enjoy and not feel they are limited to their ideas.

Students don't want to be stress all summer about a project their teacher assigned them. They should be granted to do what they want on their summer break. By allowing students to do their own summer projects lets them do what they enjoy the most. This makes it easier for them to complete and not be stressed out. This could let them have a great score coming back from summer break.

Having a summer project and letting students create it lets them think of many ideas. This lets them not feel limited of what they can or can't do. For eample everything around us involves math student could group up and measure who can throw a football the longest distince. Letting students create a project for themselfs can boost their creativity and learn difrerent things around them. In this generation kids just want to stay inside on the phone this lets them get out and think of wounderful new things.

Some people may disagre the statement of letting students creating thier own summer project. This could lead to students being foucsed too much on having fun than learning and completing the project. Students may not have hte experence of doing projects and leaving them stressed and confused. Students may not feel its nesecaery do to when its not assigned by a teacher. Which means student will fail and start off their upcoming year failing classes.

Summer projects should make you think of an easy and fun thing to do. If you had a project to do how would you would want enjoyable By allowing student to create their own gives them the chance to know what they are capable of imaging. Also letting student not think projects are not just about thinking too hard but allowing them to create a project from what they love doing. Even though others not with students creating their own project. If you had a project to do how would you would want enjoyable?
