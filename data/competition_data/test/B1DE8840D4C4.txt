Dear Principal,

The students at our school should be required to do community service. First, it helps our community and people who live in it. Second, it teaches students responsibility and it looks good on their college application in the future. Thirdly, it helps keep students out of trouble and maintain them in a safe environment. The entire school has been buzzing about this topic and by the end of this letter i hope you feel the same way as me.

First off, requiring the students to do community service helps the community. Students could clean up local parks and keep them nice and tidy. They can also raise money for the poor or other organizations. They can clean up graffiti and help out at a local food bank. This makes the community a better place. It also makes it a better place for people to live with their families for generations to come.

Secondly, community service teaches students responsibility. Many teenagers these days, only care about hanging out with friends, and don't care about their school work, parents, or responsibilities. Making them to community service will give them a sense of reality and teach them that life's not easy, and that they need to take action now before its too late. Also community service looks good on a college application and makes colleges a little more interested.

Thirdly, the number of crime with young teenagers has been increasing over the years. More and more kids are doing drugs, smoking, drinking, and living under the influence. They believe that doing all of this is okay, but its really not. Community service provides a safe environment for our students. It will reduce the number of our students living under the influence. And increase the number of students graduating.

In conclusion, the students at our school should be required to do community service. First because it makes our town a better place. Next, it builds responsibility and character. And lastly it will keep out students out of trouble. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and i hope you are considering my reasons.
