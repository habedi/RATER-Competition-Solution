dear principal,

I think you should let the students participate in sports with a b, because some people might be trying really hard in school to play. If a student has a b it is still passing the grade he\she is in. sometimes i think that grade doesn't matter its about what kind of student they are. Now sometimes the student is doing really bad so he\she shouldn't play in sports. There are some students that make an effort to do something in school and some that don't care, now the one's that make an effort should play if they wanted to and the others that don't care not play. because its just like rewarding a murderer for killing someone. Now some people should be rewarded with playing sports. To me i don't like much sports, i like to play just for fun but not for a team its just not me.

Now that's what i think should be happening with the sports issue.

Some might think different but that's what i think about the issue. I mean i can play sports but i choose not to because its not me. I love to play outside and do stuff i cant be cooped up in the house but i cant play team sports, well it depends on which sport it is, but i think that students with a b should be able to play sports or participate in them if not play. so this is the
