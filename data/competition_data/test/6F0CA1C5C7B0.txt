This strange figure that took the shape of a face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. It looks much like a landform equivalent to a butte or mesa which are common in the American west. shadows around give the illusion to the eyes that this strange figure has eyes, a mouth, and a nose.

Proof has been found from high tech cameras that shows that this is just a landform and was not created by aliens. After we found the what seemed to be alien markings we decided to look again. Its has the same height as some natural landforms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. If they was anything that could have left a mark by aliens we would've been able to see it.

You can dipect the size of something in a photo 3 time larger in real life. So if there was anything on Mars that shows aliens were there than we would definately be able to see it, but there is none so that leads us to the conclusion that this odd looking figure is just a natural landform and not built by anybody.

To conclude my arguement on whether or not this strange looking figure is actually made by extraterrestrials or just there by nature I belive this is just a natural landform. There is proof and that it was not made by aliens and none that shows aliens made this figure. We used our best equipment to find an answer by research and strongly belive in our answer. There are no markings of aliens of any sort on Mars that could have built this figure. There is an illusion that this shape is in the shape of a face, but isnt really. The main point of this investigation was just to find out what on earth is this thing and where did it come from.
