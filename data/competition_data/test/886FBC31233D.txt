We should be allowed to study Venus. To begin with Venus and Earth have somethings in common even though Venus may be a some what dangerous planet there are some things that they have in common. Something that the author said was " Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth." In other words what the author is trying to say is that Venus maybe once had the same features just like Earth does today. But now it's all dry. There are some features that Venus has and Earth too. Venus has a rocky sediment and has valleys, mountains and crater just like Earth does. Another good reason we should study Venus is that maybe one day the Earth were in right now may dissapper and we would have to move to a different planet. Studying something would be bad we all have to try new things. Even though Venus sounds like a very dangerous planet are could be some benfits to exploring new planets. We could find new and interting things about different planets.
