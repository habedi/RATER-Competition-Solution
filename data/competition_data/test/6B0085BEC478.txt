The Facial Action Coding System is a type of technology that can help alot of things that go wrong and it can also be bad.

This kind of technology can be and cannot be as valuable to read he students emotions because the students will have different emotions each time you read their emotions. So this technology can be valuaable because when you can read the students emotions like if there is something that is bothering them and they dont say anything, this technology can help the staff and teachers know what is going on. and it could be bad because the student who's emotions you are reading is maybe not comfortable with you reading their emotions, so you can get in trouble. So in conclusion this i am nuteral to this type of technology because i believe that it can be good or bad. No t just one or the other.
