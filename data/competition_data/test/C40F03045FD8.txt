The principle should let students to have phones at school because if someone has an emergency the can call their parents and if someone need to call someone for an important reason .

To begin with, the principle should allow phones at school because if someone for got their math homework at home and it counts for half of their grade, that persons mom or dad could go bring it to them. I remember one time when i for got my history project and i wasn't allowed to use my cell phone but what i did was i went to a bathroom and called my mom and she brought it to me, that is one reason why i think the principle should let us have cell phones in our school.

Also , i think the principle should let us have cell phones because if any one needs to call someone for an important reason like for example if i need to call my mom cause i missed the bus and the school office is closed and i have my cell phone i can call my mom and tell her that i missed the bus and she can pick me up but if couldn't use my phone i would be stuck in the school or i will need to wait for my mom until she realizes that i haven't come home yet.

In conclusion, the principle should let students to have phones at school because if they have an emergency the can call their parents and if they need to call someone for an important reason .
