What I think bout this is that really, it can either goes both ways but manily the technology would work more because of the different types of machine that are working to figure things out, like for example it could tell you weather or not if you are nervous or not, if you are lying or not. The techmology now days are so much helpful to figure certain stuff out like what the weather goona be like throught out the week or just stuff like that. Now on the other hand you can figure stuff out on your on because you can feel certain stuff that is wrong with ya like, for Example you can wake up and just know today is not my day...I mean come on now like you just know if someone talks to you the wrong way you are gonna pop off or if someone looks at you the wrong way you are gonna flip out about it and start going off. You can know or not if you are not feeling it today because really its a mind set thing...You have to process you mind to certain and be like you know this is not the right thing to do you just know it. So like I said it can go both ways .I hope you enjoy this
