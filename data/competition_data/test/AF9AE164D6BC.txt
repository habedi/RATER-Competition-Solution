Not many people enjoy waking up at 6am, then having to go to a building and work for 8 hours straight. Despite all the positive things about public school, there are still many negative factors. Such as: Students being bullied, students needing to help out at home, some students being parents or just the simple resentment of leaving their house. "Distance learning" or online school as most people refer to it as, is an amazing form of schooling and is something students can really benefit from. Learning in the comfort of your own home is a great alternative to public school, especially for high school students who are transitioning into their adult lives and might need the 8 hours they would be spending at school for something else.

Firstly, students taking a class from home have a much better opportunity to actually absorb the information due to them being allowed to move at their own pace. In public school, students must move at the teachers pace; when the teacher finishes the lesson the student has no choice but to move on and take the test at the end of a unit; however, online you would be able to revisit the lesson if there was anything you were unsure of. Vice versa, some students move faster than others but are forced to go at a slower pace to accommodate the other students instead of being able to move on when they are ready. It's very important for one to be able to move at their own pace, no two brains are the same; therefore, it's much more difficult to learn at someone else's pace. For example, if a teenage mother who is running off of 3 hours of sleep was to be in a class with a student who gets 8 hours every night, they most likely would not be able to learn at the same pace due to one of them being exhausted and the other having a full nights rest.

Stress takes a huge toll on students in school, which causes their grades to drop, which could lead to depression. Another reason online school would be beneficial, is because it'd be a lot less stressful. At school students stress about more than academics, things that also stress them out could be: friends, what they wear, how they look and social anxiety. Online school would be less stressful because students wouldn't have to deal with all of that behind a screen, which would keep their focus on their academics resulting in better grades. Social anxiety creates many problems, some students might be afraid to speak up if they're having trouble with something or simply just to ask to go to the bathroom. Being in a setting where they're practically forced to be social could cause panic attacks and mental breakdowns. Hypothetically speaking, this could lead to depression; which could make a student lose the desire to leave the house and just want to be alone. To prevent multiple unexcused absences, online school could help in this situation; they would still be learning and "attending class" but this way, they get to do it in the comfort of their own home.

In conclusion, online school is a great alternative to physically being in school. There many beneficial factors to it; although, public school is the more traditional option, distance learning should not be completely ruled out when choosing a school. It gives students a lot more freedom and control over their education, which also should be the case in public school; but sadly, is not. Online school can help the mental health of today's youth and maximize their understanding of the content they learn; this form of learning should be normalized in society.
