Is the face on Mars alien or just another natrual landform? Do we know if Mars isn't crawling with extra-terrestial beings? Yes. Yes we do. In the following paragraphs I will prove the fact that the face on Mars if in fact just a natrually formed landform. Then I will say why many people speculate if it is alien.

To begin with, many people say the face on mars could be a sign of alien life and that extra-terretial beings are calling out to us with their mound-like pyramids. It can't be possible. First, it is proven that there are no signs of any alien markings on it. The text says,"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were." Second, it has been proven that it is similar to many mesa or buttes in the western united states. The text says," what the picture actually shows is the Martian equizelant of a butte or a mesa- landforms common around the American West." Lastly, the face has been taken over and over again and every time it becomes clearer and clearer every time. This is because the technology has started getting better so the world can stat proving things to be false. One example, is the Martian face.

To conclude, many speculations have been made this is resonable because the picture wasn't originally clear and the second one was taken with clouds in the Martian atmosphere, but still the third picture shows that scientifaclly it is only a landform on the palnet of mars.
