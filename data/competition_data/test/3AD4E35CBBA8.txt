Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you about if students at SCHOOL_NAME should be require to do Community Service or not. While some students already have community hours and some don't, I think that we should be required to have community service hours. Some many say It takes up my time, or i don't have time to do anything for the community, but i think that that's just a excuse. If all students in the school had at least two hours of community service i think that our community would be a little better. While some kids already have done things for the community like volunteer at schools, fire stations, neighbors or just cleaning up the trash around your neighborhood, others think that

Most people don't care about how there neighbor hood is or about the community, what is more important is that it helps others out and that's what community service is all about. I do think that we should be required to have community service hours, if its only one hour or two hours of service at least.

I also think that it would be a great idea at our school if we make a group of students and get together twice a week and go clean up around the school or around the neighborhood. Most schools are not IB schools like our school is, but being a IB school i think we should be required IB (community service) hours.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
