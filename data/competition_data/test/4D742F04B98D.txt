I believe that driverless cars should not exist.

It's better to have people actually drive cars then to have people ride in cars without drivers.

The form of driverless cars in a public-transport already exists, its called a train.

They have to be very smart cars if they want to drive on its own.

There are so many reasons why driverless cars should not exist.

These cars are going to be so expensive that if they do make more then only a few amount of people will have them.

If people get in a car crash using the driverless car then the insurance of the man or women will have to pay for the damage when it ws actually the cars fault. Even if you crash the car the amount to fix the damage will be very expensive as well.

In the article it says "as long as thr driver is watching the road, the car will be watching the driver." Now since the driver in not actually driving the driver will eventually pull out is phone or go to sleep and since the driver wasn't paying attention the car would just crash since no was wacthing the road.

Every single piece of technology always has a malfunction so what makes us think that it is never going to have a problem.

Lots of reasons why we shouldn't have driverless cars.

If people want to but a driverless car it on them. I would get a car that will let me drive but prevent me from crashing.

Driverless cars is not a thing I will ever get. Thats what I think about driverless cars.
