I fell that people should enter the Seagoing Cowboys program for a number of reason so lets get going. So when people hear these bad things about what is going on in the world. Then many people want to see what they have to do to help. Also you have your lazy people in this world that don't even give two cares. So how about letting me do some persausion on this subject.

I think that if people participate than there will be a lot less world hunger. So for instants there are people in a different country right now starving, and just waiting for people to show up and help them. And the people that join the Seagoing Cow boys program have a great opportunity to help these other people. They also have a great opportunity to go out and explore many, many countries. If I were a grown man and a friend of mine ask me if I would want to go on an expidition to help another country I would probly say yes just to get to help people around the world.

So well I think that is all and I hope my essay would help people think about this if it ever got published. Also to the lazy people who don't care imagin itf your mom was in one of those countries starving to death. But I guess that is just some people like that I would hope. So well I think I covered every thing on my mind untill the next essay goodbye.
