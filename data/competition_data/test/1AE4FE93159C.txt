Community Service For the Children

"Please, oh please. won't somebody think of the children?" Yeah... community service for students is a bad idea. I agree that community service is a great way to improve you're community, but really? For students? While you're at it, why don't you see if you can grow a pair of wings and fly?

Kids have free time from about birth to seventh grade. After that its homework, homework, homework. Students in seventh grade and under just aren't mature enough to remember to carry out the task. Adults are always saying kids don't get enough sleep. Well do you think that forcing kids to do another two hours of work each day is going to increase there night-night minutes.

Even if some kids can find some time to squeeze in a rake or two at the park, they're not going to want to use it for that. Kids are kids: plain and simple. They need their freedom, and their free time.

Imagine you wake up one Saturday morning and call a friend, "Hey, want to hang out?" you ask. "No, not today, I can't." You frown, "Oh, family stuff?" you ask.

"No," answers your friend, "School stuff... on the weekend."

How does that sound, eh? Not too great.

Now even if you do decide to make community service mandatory for the kids at our school, you have to understand, no one's going to go. Kids are going to figure out that when they're at home that you can't force them to do anything they don't want. Of course there's going to be the students that show just to be good people, but the chances of those numbers being over twenty percent are pretty dang slim.

Back to what I was saying about sleep. If you force kids to participate in community service, that's going to give them less free time. When they have less free time, that means less time to sleep. If they have less time to sleep, that means they're going to come to school extremely tired. When they're tired at school, they're not going to do as good, meaning a fall in grades.

Forcing kids to do community service is a bad idea. It may help the community a bit, but the kids? not so much. It'll cut back on their free time, limit their sleep, and get them in trouble for not showing up in the first place. So please, won't somebody think of the children?
