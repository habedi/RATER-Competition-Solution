Imagine getting told you are required to do a summer project for school but you have to come up with the whole project by yourself. Some schools require students to do summer projects to make sure they keep learning all summer. Some schools would also like to know if the projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Although it would be easier on students, the projects should be teacher-designed. Schools that require students to do summer projects should be teacher designed because there would be less stress for students, the projects would be easier to grade, and it would most likely be less work for teachers throughout the summer.

Teacher-designed projects would have less stress on the students. If the students had to come up with the project there would most likely be a lot of missing projects. Most high school students have jobs and sports in the summer which would make having a summer project hard. Jobs and school is hard at the same time so having a teacher at least give you and idea would take stress away. Students having to come up with the project would also be a lot harder for the teacher to grade.

Teacher-designed projects would also be easier to grade. If the teacher has the idea already ready for the student then she knows what to expect. She would also know the requirements and it would be easier to give a grade. Grading is very time consuming so things to make that easier for them is probably appreciated. The teacher knowing what kind of projects she will have to grade when school starts again will be a lot less stressful for her when grading starts.

Teacher-designed projects would also be a lot less work for the teacher. Yes, the teachers have to come up with a lot of different ideas for the students. However, it will be a lot less work throughout the summer. Some students might have a lot of questions about how to do the project or ask for help. To the teacher that might be frustrating in her break from school. Teachers like there school break just as much as students.

If it was up to me the summer projects should be teacher-designed. The teachers probably wont like that idea very much because its a little extra work but it would be a lot less stressful. Teacher designed projects would be easier because there is less stress for students, teachers would have an easier time grading them, and the teachers would have less work throughout the summer.
