Why do I think that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens? I think that ,because on April 5, 1998 Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the Face on Mars ten times sharper than the orginal picture in 1976 by the Viking. My second reason why I don't believe that aliens created the Face on Mars, is becase on April 8, 2001 Malin's team took a picture of the Face on Mars. Not only is believing that the Face on Mars was created by aliens is illogical, but many pictures have been taken, there is still not a single sign of aliens.

My first reason why I don't think the aliens created the Face on Mars is because the MOC team snapped a photo of the Face on Mars ten times sharper, so you could see more clearly. You could see clearer than the orginal Viking photos. When the web surfers saw the picture, all they could see was a natural landform. Not any sign of aliens. My piont is that the clearer the pictue gets, the less it reveals that aliens created the Face on Mars.

According to the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars'', "Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'' Garvin told them. Compared to the 1976 photo taken by the Viking, the newer camera spans 1.56 meters for each pixel. This camera allows you to discern objects in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. Garvin told the author of ''Unmasking the Face on Mars.'' People who believe that aliens created the Face on Mars can not argue that it was cloudy in that picture for it was taken in the summer, unlike the previous picture. The picture that Malin's team took had no signs of aliens.

My last reason as why not aliens did not create the Face on Mars is because it's illogical. Using common sense you should be abe to see in all of these pictures that there is no sign of aliens. Photo after Phote prove that aliens did not create the Face on Mars.

All three of these reasons are why I don't think aliens created the Face on Mars. I believe that it's just natural landform.
