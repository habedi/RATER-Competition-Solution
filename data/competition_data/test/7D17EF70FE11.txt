Vroom,vroom cars go by there are cars every where people like there cars some people go to work in them others just like to ride in them. But do you think cars are good for the enviroment do you think we should have them every where we go or just for important things like work. Well people are trying to solve that problem by inventing new cars like ''the eletric car'' or ''the solar power car'' but people dont have the money to buy those things. Or should we just not have cars for a day just like in BOGATA,Colombia where they did not use there car for a day and people around the city were walking and rideing bikes to work. i think there should be a day where America should not use cars and then we could see how people react to how they think of that and say if they liked it or not. Because people in America are buying less cars and are driving less and i think we should keep it that way.

People in VAUBAN,Germany residents of a community are not useing cars and people like the idea there ''they think that its safer and they are less stressed'' you could have a car but it will cost u a fortune $40,000 just to get a car and a apartment with a garage to put the car in. But ''some people sold there cars just to live in that community'' but are happy there in the community there lives 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. so wat i think we should do is use are car less and save the enviroment from pollution and start doing what contrys like VAUBAN,Germany or paris, and BOGATA,Colombia are doing makeing this world a better place.
