I believe that the new technology which is called the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea that will help value students in a classroom . The Facial Action Coding System can help determine the way you feeling , reliezes that you might need help on a lesson that you are not comprehending very well , also it knows when something is bothering you .

When on a computer the Facial Action Coding System determines the way you feeling when the computer constructed 3-D face model revolves around all fourty four major muscles in a human face . When you show emotion towards the computer and have a movement of one or more muscles it is called a action unit which helps the com puter bring all your emotions together and be able to seperte them into they percentages . For example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ( above your eyes) raises your eyebrows which means your surprised . Your orbicularis oris ( around your mouth) tightens your lips that shows your angry . There many muscles in a human face that has a variety of different ways to show their emotions .

The new technology can also relieze when something is bothering you . For example when your friend ask " whats wrong ? " and you say nothing your friend dictated that you were lying so his/her mouth would stretch sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle , the risorius hich means dont lie . Also it can tell when you are putting on a fake smile and actually hurting inside . The computer is actually showing empathy by feeling someone elses emotional state . Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them .

When struggling on a lesson on the computer the Facial Action Coding System will notice . However " a classroom computer could relieze when a student is becoming confused or bored , then it will modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ." The same technology can make computer - animated faces more expressive - fro video games or video surgery . But also on the other note the new technology couldnt be the best idea due to the fact that some people are going through some stuff and school is a way to clear they mind and going on a computer at school with the new technology would remind them .

Many people dont relieze when their closest friends are going through something and the new technology would him .

I stated that Facial Action Coding System helped you determine your feelings , if something or someone is bothering you or if your struggling on a lesson . After reading about the new trchnology it can help you .
