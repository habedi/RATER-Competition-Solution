Dear Principle,

Being a woman of intellect and understanding you will understand my decision to say that your new policy may need some thinking over. As a student at your school, I enjoy the classes and social time between them. Yet, I also love sports and Jazz Band. Now, I don't know your history but I know that you became a principle because you loved the surroundings and the feeling of being in a school. So I ask you, why not give that to your students?

The school that you run is fantastic, and what makes it just as fantastic is the after school classes. If I'm not mistaken, your policy says that every student must have a grade B average to participate in these classes. This seems fair, but the students at this school are struggling. As you probably know most students at this school have C averages. Their only escape from the confines of the classroom is to go outside and play some sports. Sure, their efforts in the classroom are not the best, but you could help them try harder by maybe adding some extra activities after school. Maybe a half-hour class for homework help, or a catch up room. By doing this you could not only improve the students academics but also let them play the sports and music they really love.

Life of a student is challenging. At times, the whole idea of even going to school can cause stress levels to rise. Athletics could be the reason some of your students are showing up for class. To take that away from them is a mistake. For some of your students, getting a B average is simple. But if thirty percent of your school is playing sports, this could look bad for not only your reputation as an outstanding principle, but for the school district. They will think something has gone wrong. For all you know, some kids will be so upset with the new policy they will try even less in the classroom.

So friend, think about my idea. Add some academic classes and change the new policy and I promise you, happier kids, better grades, and greater reputation will be flowing your way. Sounds nice doesn't it? I don't have the power or authority to change the policy. You do. Just think about my ideas and think about the kids.

Sincerely, your friend
