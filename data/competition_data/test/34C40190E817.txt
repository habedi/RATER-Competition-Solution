Do you agree or disagree with everyone doing extracurricular activities after school? Well I agree with everyone doing extracurricular activities. The reason I agree with this statement is because doing extracurricular activities can help people make friends and become more social,it helps them become more active and improves their physical ability and it improves their ability to work with other people.

Doing extracurricular activities can help people make friends by working together. It helps them become more social,for instance by joining football or other programs they meet other people with the same interests and they can connect in and out of school. They also meet a lot of faces they haven't met before during school and if they're in the same program or club they can get know each otherÂ more. They can connect with people of different ages when they're in the program so they can learn something from someone older than them or teach something to the younger person to help them to the right path in life. Joining these programs or clubs helped me make a lot of friends and it taught me a lot of things such as what younger people are interested in or what they struggle in.

Doing extracurricular activities such as football or other physical sports helps them be more active or and it improves their physical ability and mental ability. Doing sports help students be more active by enhancing cardio and helping them try other sports. Such as everyday practice can help students make sure they get 2 hours of exercise every day so it helps themselves feel better and become better. It also helps their physical ability by doing drills and practicing everyday which will cause physical improvement to their body. The reason I say doing these activities help your mental ability is because it helped me improve my grades and behavior and pushed me to my very best and I feel great because doing these activities lead me out the hole I dug myself into.

It helps minors with the ability to work with other people and to helps everyone to learn to work as a team. Such as doing a sport helps them work with other people because a football team typically has more than 40 guys on the team. Studies at the University of Louisiana show that 67% of people that do these type of activities are more better at doing work with groups rather than work alone. Working together helps people build their skills and helps them to get used to working with big groups or any size group. As my father once said"team work,makes the dream work".

Do you agree with everyone doing extracurricular activities? Yes I heavily agree with everyone doing extracurricular activities. Now you the reader knows why I agree because it helps people make friends and become social,it helps them become more active and improves their physical ability and it helps their ability to work with other people. Doing extracurricular activities helped me a lot and I hope it helps everyone that is planning to do a extracurricular activity in school.
