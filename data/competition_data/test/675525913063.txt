Why would you want to explore the hottest planet in our solar system?! Well the author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," trys to explain why people would want to do such a thing!

In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author explains that venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system and that humans want to explore it?! He mentions that that Venus is earths old twin. Keep in mind humans have never set foot on Venus or even taken a shuttle there, the only thing that has ever come close to Venus is a Shuttle with no one in it.

Old twins? The author states,"Often referred to as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size". Later in the article he mentions how people suspect that Venus used to just like Earth,"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters".

The author mentions how scientist are trying to come up with ways to explore Venus seeing how its to hot for humans to get close to the ground. One way scientist have come up with ways to explore Venus is having humans go in a shuttle and stay up in the sky where its about 600 degrees colder and use light to try and shine through Venus's atmosphere and getting a view of it from way up in the sky but still not being able to set foot on it to collect samples.

Would you still be interested in exploring such a hot and somewhat useless planet?! The author really goes in depth about the ways we could explore Venus and how Venus is different and simular to earth but never disscusses how much exploring Venus would be.
