Myself, being a 15 year old girl, I have yet to drive a driverless car, so I don't know exactly how well I like them. In my opinion I don't think it's that great of an idea. I believe that if a person thinks they can take on the responsibilty of being able to drive a car then they should be fully able to do all the things involved with drivng. What if the driverless car so happenes to malfinction? The possiblities are endless when it comes to the things that could go wrong, when it comes to driverless cars.

If you think you are prepared for driving then I think you should know all the tasks you have to do and be able to perform them tasks while driving. The person driving should be responsible and be very aware of his surrounding, and they should always be alert. If you think you should be driving then you have to be responsible for yourself and the others around you. Not only is your life on the line so is theirs. You shouldnt have to rely on electronics and computers to help you drive. That may also make you forget about the rules of driving.

Don't get me wrong, I think it would be awesome if we didn't have to drive ourselves around. Not have to worry about looking both ways, or getting into a crash. In reality we just can't trust it. what if something were to happen where the antilock breaks lock up in the middle of the Highway or something and 5 People are killed in a crash? Who is responsible then? Mistakes do happen, so that's why I think the cars should just stay how they are. Let people take on the resposibilites of the safety of themselves and others.
