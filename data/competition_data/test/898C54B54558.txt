Dear principal i think you should let people with C average grades get to play sports because what will they do through out the school year they wont be active, and they will have nothing to do if they cant do anything unless you let C average play sports in the school that they are in. C average should get a little something besides not going to practice because they got a C average. To me a C average is decent so you should cut some slack for the C averages and let them play sports at the school the they attend. to me that's strick if you wont let the C averages play sports so you should let them play sports. And by the way what's wrong with a C average its passing its better than a D average.

when you don't let C average play you might not know if they are good at that sport or decent at it. you might not know if that C average person could help the school win a trophy or a ribbon so he or she could represent the school. also why wont you let C average do any activities because that means that the C averages will be lazy. when the C averages don't do anything for the rest of they're middle school and high school careers and the C averages will probably be fat and wont do nothing if you don't let C averages do an activity or a sport. and that's all i have to say to you.

sincerely student
