What is every student participated in extracurricular activities? I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can make new friends, be involved in something after school or on the weekend and make a change to their community.

If every student did some kind of a extracurricular activity, they could all get at least one person that can be called your friend. Everyone needs that one person that plays football with you, helps you with your homework, and cheers you up when you're down. Imagine how many new friends you would make with extracurricular activities.

If every student did some kind of extracurricular activity, instead of eating potato chips and watching T.V, they could be playing soccer with friends, or making clothes for the homeless. Think of all the free time you have, and what you could be doing with that time if you participated in a extracurricular activity. Even if it's just playing chess and checkers with friends, think of what you would be doing right now if you were at you're house.

If every student did some kind of extracurricular activity, like volunteering at a local pet shelter, or helping your family pay for college, that is still making a change to you're community. Imagine if some students chose to make something as small as raising enough money for a new slide at the local park, or even raising enough money to build a brand new local park. Some people may choose to work and help pay for their college, or buy a special gift for their parents anniversary, it's still affecting the community in some way.
