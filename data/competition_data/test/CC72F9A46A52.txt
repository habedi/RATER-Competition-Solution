The article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" has lots of useful information about the planet venus and it's difficulty to be explored as well as why it is worth exploring despite the danger.

Even though it is dangerous to explore Venus, the article does have some good points regarding why it is worth the risk to explore it. One example from the article is in paragraph 4 which reads, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system". This excerpt helps show that Earth and Venus were quite similar at one point, making it important to explore and discover how both planets were similar, and if humans could live on Venus at some point, as well as many other unanswered questions.

Another good point that the author makes in paragraph 4 which reads, "recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." This part of the article helps show that there can be many practical uses for information discovered about Venus during these explorations even if there is danger involved when trying to explore.

Overall, the author has a strong argument for the benefits of exploring Venus outweighing the danger and difficulty
