Do you believe projects in the summer be teacher designed or student designed? Well from my point of view, as a junior at Generic_School. I feel like all summer projects should be designed by a teacher if you wanna boost their learning through the break. One way you can prove that is, when a teacher may teach you information that you never heard of before. Unlike having to something you already know.

First for instance, if your teacher gives you a project it can be beneficial many ways. You may be learning something that you haven't learned before, and could be learning it in one of your subjects when you get back to school, so when you learn about that topic in a period you would be ready, cause you was provided with information you learned during the summer that teacher taught you. Also, some students prefer being given directional instructions while during an assignment. It helps them because everything is there for them because the teacher them with instructions to complete the project.

However, they're some ways kids benefit from having their own designed project. This includes,kids or teens may not have financial they need for the projects teachers instruct them during the summer.

Also, when they come back to school during the summer they can teach one another something new during things like presentations and etc. Another reason why student should design their summer project, is because students may not feel confront able with the project the teacher assigned them, and are more likely to do better with something they already know.

So through all these details, what do you believe should students design their own projects during the summer or should the teachers design them. Like said teachers provide some students with information they never heard or ever learned. And you may be informed with information you may be leaning in the next school year.
