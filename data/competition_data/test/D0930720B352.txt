If it was made by aliens wouldn't it look less like a face? To me it lookes like it was formed like that because you can tell that after so many years it faded away. in 1976 it lookes like a face and then in 1998 it lookes like a normal rock formimg,in 2001 it doesnt even look like a face at all.

Think about it if an alien made it wouldn't it look more creative or more unlike a face,because really the NASA dosnt even know if aliens are real, if they are real it doesn't mean they would make something like a face. you can tell because in the passage it says that scientists figured out it was just another mesa.

you can also tell because in paragragh 3 it says it was created by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. In the passage it says what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a mesa-landforms common around the american west. so it is likley to happen.
