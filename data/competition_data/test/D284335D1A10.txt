Hello there, my name is Luke Bomberger, and I'm here to convince you to participate in my favorite program, the Seagoing Cowboys. To be apart of this program is an opportunity of a lifetime. It all started when the 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA. They hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. We went everywhere, including Europe, China, Greece, and even Italy! I even have a spectacular story about me in Greece. I turned eight-teen before arriving in Greece, which ment that I could be in the military, but when they realized that I was a Seagoing Cowboy, they told me to just keep doing it for my service.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy I was even the one who made nine whole trips. The most of any Seagoing Cowboy! Being apart of this, was one of the greatest opportunities for a small-town boy like me. It was helping out on my Aunt Katie's farm had prepared me for the hardwork for the animals like by feedding and water them two or three times a day, feeding the horses bales of hay and bags of oats, and the stalls even had to be clean. One thing I can say about that part, is that it did keep me busier than ever!

There were too many fun times we had, but there were times that we didn't. On my second trip, I served as a nightwatchman, and my only job was to check on all the animals every hour. After I made one of my hourly reports, I slid down a very slick ladder. My heart was like a bullet beating so fast in my chest. I almost fell into the Atlantic Ocean. My ribs were so cracked, they said that they can't even work for the next couple of days, so I didn't.

Although there were scary parts of all the trips, there were fun parts too! I always had fun on board, especially after the animals had been unlodaded. We would play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games all helped pass the time. It really opened up the world for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity.
