In the late 1800's in was a huge deal to have a car, only rich people had them. Today it is a necessity to have a car, if you dont have one it is a big deal. But not everyone enjoys diriving some people want to not have to drive to live in an everyday environment. There are so many pros to having a walkable society, one being pollution.

In new York city there is millions of people, and millions of cars. When you have that manny people needing to get places most people drive. But that causes a problem it makes polution a big thing in these big cities, cars cause polution and people think i need a car to be able to get around. Thats not true, engineers these days are trying to make more of thyese "walkable comunities." A walkable comunity is one that can be travfersed by foot and does not require a car.

If you were to walk everywhere that you normally drive You would be burning a massive amount of calories. This in turn would keep people in shape and in better health and thats always a plus. If every one in a comunity is healthy then everyone would live long and every one wants to live longer. More people living longer means more people in the comunity more people in a comunity. more people in a comunity means more people working and leads to a higher production rate.

In the end cars limit the growth of humans by causing polution and people that are not in shape. Polution is a big problem in the world today and this is a way to stop it. People in america are becoming over weight and lazy if peoplewere to just bike or walk where there going it would help out the world greatly. So please next time you need to drive down the road, just grab a bike or even walk to you destination.
