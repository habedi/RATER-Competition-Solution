Many people belive that the face on Mars was created by an alien or aliens. We have evidance that proves it was not.

In 1997 (MGS) arrived on the Red Planet and stayed there for eighteen long yeas. On April 5,1998 (MGS) got a picture of Cydonia, while thousands of web surfers were waiting for the picture to apper on the JPL web site. The picture reavealed a natural landform. Also that there was no alien moniment after all.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, I added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. These are some facts on how we know that Cydonia the face on Mars was not created by aliens, and is just a normal land structure.
