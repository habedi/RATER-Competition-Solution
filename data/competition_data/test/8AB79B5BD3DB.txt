Do you think that you can tell people face expressions? Well if you can't right now i'm going to help you figure it out by the end of the essay. I think that it is good to use the technology to read the emotoinal expressioins on someones face. The reason i think this is beacuse maybe one student is sad and no one call tell that but maybe you can make them go from sad to happy just by talking to them. I can sometimes tell if someone is not felling happy or sad or just having a bad day.

In the start of paragraph four it says that we huamns perform this impressive "calulation" every day. I think that is very true about what it says. I think also that maby not everone can think that it is true but i belive it. The Mona Lisa demonstration it did bring a small smile on my face. Another good reason to have this is like what Huang said that it would recoginze someones face and it should tell the teacher if they are confused about that question.

I think that every thing that we use in this world that uses technology should be able to read your face emotional expression. In paragraph seven I think that its true that my home computer shouldn't be able to handle it. Also in paragraph seven it tell you to do face expressions and when i did it worked i was mad and then i was happy.

Everyone should try doing that and see if they like doing that.

So do you fell like you could tell someones emotions by me explanning it? I know that i fell like I can tell someones emotions right of the bat. I hope at least some of you know how to tell someone face expressions but if not its fine. did you have fun reading this. That is my support with doing it.
