Nowadays people show their emotions simply just by looking at their face. Today's technology is advancing quickly that they even found a way to tell people's emotions. How can they accurant about they're emotions though? I personally think that only a person can feel what they're going through. I don't think technology is so accurate to look into someone's soul.

Prof. Thomas Huang and his crew discovered a new software that can recognize emotions. However I believe that no one can tell other people how they but them theirselves. How can they actually calculate emotions, only us humans express what we feel, not technology. This software begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This software is not very accurate.

We humans perform this same impressive "calculation" everyday. You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking at their face because you know the person that well. Although most of us would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang studies artist such as da Vinci to help him paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electrical code.

The famous painting Mona Lisa is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. It's like saying that your own PC can tell your emotions, it's pretty impossible. To an expert, faces don't lie. Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.

Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. For example, actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowining as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Someone's emtions is way more different than the science of emotions.
