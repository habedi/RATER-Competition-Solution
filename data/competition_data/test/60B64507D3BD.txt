The most important goal for a student is to complete their academic studies, but for many of them this is a challenge, becuase they came from others contries, some of them have children or a job and can not complete all the classes at school. For these reasons many schools decides to start doing online classes, and this is a great desicion for students, because in that way they can be organizing their time, be increasing their academic education and also this help them with the school credits, and in that way be able to graduate.

Online classes are a good opportunity, since they can be able to take the classes at home, and they can be organize, concentrate, paying attention to the online teacher designed, also they have to be doing assigments, quizzes and a test each Unit,but in a flexible way. They can been more responsible with their homework's and research important information that can help them be more sucessful in classes. Online teacher are always disponible to help each students, and that is great, because they are learning as a class.

The idea of make this dream true for these special students was to beneffict them in a academic way, so students can continue their studies and they have the help of the teacher's, they explain the class and make groups that introduce them to others students, in that way each of them are learning and increassing the ability of interact with others that are doing the same challenge and feel that they are not the only ones who are making this dream true. Every student can show their strengts and love of studies by doing everything that is posible to complete all their requirements.

This strategy apports a unique facility for these students that are doing they last school year, and are needing to complete to many classes and credits. For this metho students can be compleating all the required classes and with the same value of a regular class taking at a school. This not make students less than others, or doesn't means that they are not learning in a right way, because is not true, they are equal to the others students and are learning the same information as the others. Onlines classes are part of a school.

In my personal opinion, I conclude that students who attent classes from home by way of online or video conferencing are taking a great desicion, because this make feel students that is not anything in this world that we as students can not make, we have a lot of good options to continue been succesful in life and be seeing as student's. That's why we should be part of these wonderful opportunities.
