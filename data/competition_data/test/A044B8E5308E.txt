For me the best Policy is the first one because they will have it off during classes. Besides there is nothing wrong with calling or texting your friends. I mean what if there is an emergency and you have to use your cell phone to tell you friends that emergency. For example if you and your friends had the some classes but you have it before your friends and there is a pop quiz, you are able to tell your friends during you are walking to you next class.

Sure there might have their cell phones out during class time, then and only then the teacher may take up the cell phones and give it after class. But it will not be far to the students if a teacher takes up their cell phones on the students free time or lunch period, otherwise the teachers will be the one that will be breaking the rules or the policy. If the cell phone is the cause of their tardy then the teacher can take up the cell phone.

That is some that should happened if cell phones are allowed, and that is why the cell phones should be allowed
