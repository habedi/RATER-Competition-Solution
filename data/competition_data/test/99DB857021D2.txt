Millions of people around the world use cars, trucks, or any means of transportation, although some cities have started to limit or even ban their car usage.  This has both made people happy and others were angeres.  Even so limiting car usage is actually beneficial in many ways.

Limiting car usage is a beneficial idea because it benefits with the environent.  Cars have been known for polluting the skies and the very air that we breathe.  As a matter of fact "12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe come from passenger cars" (source 1).  This means that if this magnitude of greenhouse gases are being emitted by passenger cars alone then the air will be polluted and animals plants and other organisms will die.  Additional evidence supports the fact that car limitation is a beneficial act to society.  According to Source 3 by Andrew Selsky, the people of Bogota Columbia have been satisfied with the limitations of car usage in the city, the article states that "it's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution"(source 3).  This means that in the limiting the idea of car usage we can decrease the pollutant that poison may living things around the world.

Another advantage in limiting the amount of car useage is that it lowers traffic.  Many of todays roads are conjested by thousands of people using the road for their own purposes in shrinking the level of  cars being used we can shrink that by a large amount.  This is supporeted by Source 2, written by Robert Duffer, in this article he explains that cars, trucks, ect. are the cause of much conjestion and pollution.  This contributes to why Paris decided to pass a partial driving ban in Paris.  According to this source since the ban car conjestion went down by 60 percent (source 2).  This means that the streets are now safer and clearer in the area.  Other sources state that car bans in Bogota Columbia have lead the residents of that city to find other means of transportation to devoid traffic (source 3).  This means that if cars are limited then traffic will decrease.

A benifactor in limiting car useage isit eliminates stress.  Car infested areas have meant tons of stress.  By limiting the cause of the problem then you eliminate the problem itself.  According to Source 1 people in the outskirts of Germany have become more relaxed in life since cars have been banned.  "I feel less tence" one of the people the author interviewed said.  This key evidence means that if cars are limited then people can live a relaxed worry free life.

Car limitations are a beefit to todays society in ways that it can progress human society rather than pull it back with all the problems it causes.  Are cars really what society needs.
