Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Most individuals like myself believe that online classes are a issue in public schools and should be dialed back a few yards. Online teachings are supposed to be made for students that come from a another country, speak another language, badly ill or disable , but some schools dont realize the power your giving students when they give them this authority.

Not every student is a good student and not every student is going to use this power with great responsibility.

This day in age of 2020, kids are growing highly intelligent when using technology , so in some cases a kid could be at home doing something else like watch TV , play video games or talk to friends while a teacher is going through a lesson. Originally thats what kids would do in class , but they would usually get caught or get some sort of punishment , BUT since kids are at home teachers cant see what theyre doing according to the fact that face timeÂ could only show your face on camera and for students thats a weakness that teachers will have to abide by when a student picks this option and this will grow extremely in the future for the right reasons and the wrong reasons its up to the students. Hopefully they'll make the right one.
