You should allow students to bring cell phones to call someone in lunch periods, or ask the teacher to take a picture of the lessons of examples on the board, or play some music on there. We shouldn't text or call then the teacher is teaching because that is the rule the teacher will take it away and you not get it back until it depends a parent pick up or get it until ending of class period or get it end of the day. The reason why they should use this policy because probably people wanted to go to that school and the education.

They shouldn't have policy 2 because the it will be not fair to the students and what's going to happen when you are walking and they need it for a emergency to contact what is going on. Also people be saying I will not go to this school because there's a phone policy about it if you do bring it they are going to take it away and never give it back until ending of the year.
