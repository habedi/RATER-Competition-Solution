Some teachers always told me " you can never stop learning".

You can really never stop learning, and teachers know that. Thats why teachers should design summer projects, to help a student be above what they were the following year,and help them have a jump start when they go into the next year by helping them retain information and having them explore into the subject they are going to learn the next year. Its good to remember that the key to learning is to never stop learning, and teacher know that the best.

Some teachers like to give assignments to students over the summer to help them retain any information that can help them in their next year if school. English teacher usually let students pick a book and they have to write a essay or give a presentation about the book. Other teachers might have you explore what you are going to learn next year and make you do a project on the subject you are going into next year to see if it can give you a jump start in your subject. With this jump start you will be above other students who were not given a summer project by their teacher, assuring that you will succeed in your subject.

Teachers will normally give the student all summer to finish their project. This is more than enough time to do a project especially during summer break because you have more time during the day. During the school year teachers give a time period to finish a project and it is usually a lotÂ shorter than 2 months. Students should have no excuse to not be able to finish a summer project assigned by their teacher. With having 2 months to do an assignment you can break it up in parts and do it throughout the whole break to help you even more o retain information.

Coming back to school with a fresh memory is the key to succeed. It will help you go back to school already feeling refreshed with everything you need to know. If a student were to design a project to do over the summer they would make it about stuff they are already good at or mastered, When a teacher designs it, it's to help you learn something you will need for the next year. When teachers design these projects its to help students and some students don't really understand. They think it's just a teacher giving them work to do over the break they are not supposed to have work during, but its designed to help them learn.

Giving a summer assignment is a way to never stop learning. I believe teachers should design the projects students do because they usually know what students need to know for the up-coming year. Teacher like to assign summer projects so students can continue learning even after their long summer break. This isn't a bad idea, after all, they give the students around 2 months to finish the project depending on how long their break is. This will help students retain some information that can help them in their up-coming school year so they can have a fresh memory coming back. If students were to design a school project they would usually take advantage and not give themselves a good enough project to help them retain information.
