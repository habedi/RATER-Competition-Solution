I don't think the use of this technology would be very ethical, when you think about the things that most people would use it for, because of ads. America runs on brands, everywhere you look, brand, brand, brand. I could be sitting at home in my Ikea couch, playing on my Microsoft Xbox, while listing to music on my Alienware pc, with Spotify. People could use this technology to shovel ads into your face, and they will. I do have another thought on this though, it could be used to help people in need, people such as abuse victims. A lot of people try to hide deppresion, and this technology could be used to make the growing suicide rate in America plummet like a bag full of cylinder blocks, in the ocean. Surely this tech is flawed in many ways as it is made by humans, and we are not perfect by any means, I mean you can't always tell how someone is feeling based only on their face. This technology, can be frustrating, as well as life saving.
