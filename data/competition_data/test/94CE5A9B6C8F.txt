Space is a strange place with an unlimited amount of possibilities, one of which is the possibility of alien life. Because of this, I can understand why you might think that this is evidence of alien life. In hopes of debunking this suspicion, I am hoping you will read through my provided evidence that supports my claim that this "face" was not created by aliens.

First off, NASA would not be trying to hide the existence of aliens from the public. Their budget is primarily based on the tax and donation of those who are interested in space. If aliens were to exist, and NASA knew this, telling the public would give their budget a massive increase. So, to dismiss the accusation that NASA is hiding proof of evidence from you, I assure you that they would have told us just to get the much needed rise in their budget.

The picture of the "face" was taken forty years ago, just seven years after we first landed on the moon. As stated in the article, this was, in fact, the best resolution they could take the picture with. If you put two and two together, you can conclude that the highest resolution at the time was not very high at all compared to modern day photos.

Finally, you must take into considerationg that Mars is just like Earth, a planet. This means that it will have geographical land marks just like Earth. This "face" has been confirmed to be butte or mesa, which are common here on Earth, as said in the article. If we were to colonize Mars in the future, and someone were to observe Earth and see such a land formation, do you think they'd call it proof of aliens? Of course not!

With the evidence I provided above, I hope you are able to make your own conclusion. As said before, the vast emptiness of space is impossible to predict, and the existence of aliens is likely. Everyone is entitled to believe what they want to believe when it comes to aliens, so I am only able to hope that you are convinced by my essay.
