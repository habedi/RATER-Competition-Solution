What do you think about making students participate in extracurricular activities. Well I agree that making students do something that could be fun also great for physical health is a amazing idea, learning new things from it, however it's not great for all people. for example people that have no time or have problems that are going on in there personal life.

The best things about making them active, they can learn how to work as a team and thats hard to learn but easy to teach, disliking the fact no one does it. Making them play a sport of any kind can help them with teamwork also building spirit or character. Then again not everyone likes sports some like art or acting we can use kids talents to also help the school. Lets say the first thing what comes to mind of course a Talent Show parents always like seeing there kid doing what they love. Doing this without making them will boost there spirits, Therefore helping the school in the process.

"I don't want to" or "thats to much work" these are the words that kids have been saying for decades. Every kid has or still are saying this they just want nothing to do with sports,talent shows,going outside even getting out of bed. However when they hear a phone ring,console turning on, games in general there like a rocket going to the moon and never stopping. You can stop them they just don't want to, so doing this "they have to play a sport or do some extracurricular activity" is not going to work. Bus as my parents say theres always a way and for this case there is but I disagree with the idea. Honestly though there are a bunch of ways to help teachers with technology. Main way is to help them make there teaching less boring for students using kahoot,coolmath, something that students can create. Example like what are tech teacher is doing, creating a house using technology for kids or making math games.

There is the good active people and the just stay inside all day kind of people, no one really looks at the people who don't have time they shove them in the corner of stay inside group and move on. Even if they play a sport or go outside. Most people don't have time to do more things just for the school even if they want to they are either mentally of physically can't do it. And some person starts making them do more and think there just bratty and lazy, in conclusion they do what you say because its for the best. Now you have hundreds of kids going to school at seven in the morning and going home at ten at night. All I am saying is that not everyone can do it you need to give these children a will to say no! even if there lying because you never know if there not.

Making children do something to me sound cruel. But if you just flip the picture around doing it a different way it can help people learn even if there not in school. Now I don't have a specific answer if I agree or not everything has a good and bad side, it can and will help you learn new and important things, therefore all I can say is do you agree?
