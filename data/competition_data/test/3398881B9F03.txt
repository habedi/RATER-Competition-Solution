My name is Luke Bomberger, and I'm here to tell you why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you love farm animals, pretty sights, fun breaks, and rides on the sparkling ocean on nice sunny days, this is definitly the job for you. Of course there are some down sides like storms, but if you take this job seriously, the view of sunup and sundown will make your day very happy!

Reason number one is the fact that you get to to take care of all the animals! The types of animals you take care of are: horses, young cows, mules, and more! You'll feed them, give them water, and clean there pens. If that doesn't sound nice to you, reason number two will definitly wake you at least kinda want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program

Reason number two was one of my favorites, the beautiful sights! On every trip, we see at the least one beautiful sight. We toured an exavated castle and it was very beautiful.

Reason number three is when we arrive on land, people unload the animals while we get to play a bunch of games! We play vollyball, baseball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing and more! If you aren't into thats stuff, you can always do something yourself like reading or whittling.

My last and final reason is the view of the beautiful ocean. On sunny days when the ocean is calm, you can go on the deck and just look at the way the sun shines on the ocean. Even at night the moon sometimes gives enought light to shine in the ocean, and it makes a very pretty reflection. If I had to describe the beauty two words they would be, very beautiful.

If being with animals, pretty sights, free time, and the sparking ocean didn't convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, I don't know what else will. To those of you that do join, good luck to you and I hope you have fun.
