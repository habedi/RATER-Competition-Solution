Driverless cars are coming. They are so dangerous to a human an his/her families life. Driverless cars would be ok if the technitions knew what they were doing.

My position on these diving cars is nowhere. Humans can drive cars fine. Yea we get tired of driving because we are always on the road. Also, driverless cars aint all driverless anyways cause they tell you to take over if they're in complicated traffic or in roadworks. Like what if the person in the driver seat falls asleep and the car needs it to take over will it cause a wreak?

Letting google make the driverless cars is outrageous you told have like toyota, ford, chevy, or maybe even pontiac but google they shouldnt have the right tot be able to build a car let alone a diverless car. Google makes alot of money as it is they are just trying to make more money with this car but i dont think anybody should buy it cause if it messes up and you wreak they will think its the person who is in the driver seats fault.

I mean making it isnt as bad of an idea but i dont think noone will buy it because of the technical difficulties it could have. Like you could wreak and blow up and google would of thought it was the person driving at that giving point, but they wouldnt know who was driving because it was on auto pilot and the driver fell asleep and crashed and blew up.

The special track that they have for the driverless cars should be were they are only aloud to be. So, you dont cause no accidents in the middle of the city with a car that blew up because of technical difficulties. I think google should just stay with the internet blogs cause they make enough money as it in being the first page when you click the internet broswer. they shouldnt be building a car cause if the do and something happens to them when they are sold to people and the mess up people could come back and sue thm because its not like a orginal car with a motor no its a car with computers evrywhere in it.
