In my opinion, I think driverless cars would be a great idea for our future. Driverless cars have many postive things about them for example, they use less gas than cars today. People would love to save money. Lets say a person had to babysit until midnight and then that person has to wake up early in the morning to go to work. Well, that person with a driverless car would't have to worry about driving or perhaps having an accident. The car could be driving by itself and the passenger(s) could be on their phones or doing any other activity. Of course, someone should pay attention and make sure there is no roadwork or accidents. Many items have already been improved so making a big change like this could make everything different. The companies who make these cars (Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan) will also make lots of money because I'm sure that many people will want to own a driverless car of their own. To all the people out there that don't know how to drive, these driverless cars could make their lives easier. Today's technology is very advanced so there wouldn't really be any problems with the cars. We have everything we need and maybe even the government would use driverless cars. Imagine ambulances, police cars, fire-trucks, and taxi's being availble for the community! Driverless cars could be used all over the world and they could make our lives better. These cars even give signals when someone should take over the wheel. For example, the seat might vibrate or just announce it. This would be a new way to drive and it would be much more entertaining. Driverless cars shouldn't be illegal or banned. There is nothing wrong or bad about them. People should just be responsible and everything will be okay. Since 2009 cars like this have been developed and now its 2016, so the chances are that these cars could be even better and safer. Our future is supposed to be better and that's why I think that driverless cars should be created and sold.
