Dear Principal,

I think it is an excellent idea to change the school policy on athletic sports. Many kids do sports, but have bad grades in their classes. I think this is because they are cut low on time to do projects and homework due to their sport practices and games they are required to go to.

Some students can still finish all their work in enough time and go to their after-school sports. Some students may not care about school because they think they will get a scholarship to college through sports. If they can't play sports, they can't get a scholarship. This will force them start working harder so they can get a scholarship.

If you made this policy, it would make some kids concerned and then they will start working harder to get work finished.

Students may not care about some of their grades, but with sports on the line, they may start caring.

Parents will be happy to see that their kids are taking school seriously. Most kids would disagree and argue with you concerning this policy, but in the end they will benefit from it through improved grades. Thank you for doing this; it will really help our school and make our kids happier to see that they will be getting better grades. The students, parents and teachers will be pleased with your decision once it starts affecting everybody in after-school sports. I encourage you to follow through with this policy, I truly believe it will accommodate the school quite nicely.

Sincerely,

Student
