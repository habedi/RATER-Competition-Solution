Dear principal

I think we should be able to bring cell phones to school because kids can drive to school so they would need someone to pick them up. Also kid need to call there parents if something changes or they need to do something after school. When kids have something goes wrong in school or walking home or kids who do sports after school.

I got a cell phone in 7th grade when i made a sports team after school. if i did not have a cell phone there would be no way i could tell them if i have practice of if i didn't have practice. when i was on the basketball team after school sometimes i had a home game and my parents wanted to go and then when i got to school it changed to a away game and if we couldn't bring cell phones to school my parents would show up at dag and i would be away at a different school. i understand why the principal thinks that it would get kids in less trouble because than kids would text during school and kids steeling phone but it would be good if kids have an after school activity.

It would also be good if we were allowed to bring cell phones to school because if parent have to tell of if there would be a change in plan. One time i got a text and its was my mom saying to be a walker because they had to pick up something after and you have a game. If i didn't have a phone i would take the bus like i was could to that morning and i would miss my game and she would be waiting at the school and i would be home. it is important for kids i have a phone because the parent and kids need to see what is going on after school and where the y need to be after school. If there

This is why i think it is a good idea for the kids to have a phone at school and be able to check it a lunch or when walker and bus are being called. But if the kid use the cell phone during school the teacher should take it away and they should get it back at the end of the day.
