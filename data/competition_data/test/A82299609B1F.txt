As a child, usually in summer you are assigned a summer book assignment or any task to keep your brain working over the summer. Many children complain about this and say it is pointless and would prefer to do there own projects and not ones assigned to them by teavchers. They feel as if it would be much easier and would not have to do as much work. But, teachers knowwing topics for kids to work on, them knowing requirements and what thy NEED to lear, and pushing the students by giving them not easy tasks shows that teachers should be the ones designing summer projects

Teachers got to where they are in life and there career from one very huge cause, knowing what they are teaching and talking about to students. There whole jobs purpose iis to understand topics and briefly explain them to students, They spend years learning so much so they have so much more experience on topics and what would challenge students and help them grow. While some people may think students do know topics very well and would e able to challenge themselves, teachers give everyone that extra oush which is much needed because at the end of the day they just want to see all of their students succeed.

Along ith teachers knowing what to teach students and how to explain it to them, they also know what requirements are needed for projects and wgat students need to do to be able to get good grades. Rubics tae several days to be created, sometimes teachers caan not do it alone they go over it with there peers. They do this to help students be strong and do good on there assignemnts to show that if they work hard they will rcieve a fair grade for the amount of work they put in. Even though some students may make requirements hard so they can push themselves, many would also try to make it as easy as possible so they do't have to spend tht much time on it and enjoy there summer. Teachers make requirements that are not extreme but they are necessary so students do not slack and if they choose to there grade will show it.

Many teachers have multpile years of experience and have seen so many of there former students take so many different paths in life. Teachers try there absolute hardest to push students to help them grow and becoe mature and responsible young men and women. Because even though it may seem like they do not care what happens to you, they do bcause they have a huge impact on your life. As one of my teachers had said, the hardest thing about teaching is seeing someone not come out of there lass to do good with there lives, they push each and every student in hopes that they will encourage them to succeed and drive in life to be succcesful. Some students may think that there teacher doe not care, but they do and they try to ush you mentaly to try to make you stronger.

Very many students would love to create there own work fo them to do over the summer. Some may say it ill be easier for them to create there own work because they know how far to push themselves. But, teachers knowing topics better than students, knowing specific requirements needed, and the, pushing students past there limit to try to help them grow shows why TEACHERS should be the ones designing summer assignments. That is why i believe teachers should create summer assignments and not students
