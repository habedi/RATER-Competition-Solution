Schools want students to continue their education over summer break with projects the student body want to the design. Should they be allowed to? Although teachers would make the project more educational ad school related, the students should be allowed to make the projects. The teachers would make the project more educational, but it's the students summer break. Summer is a time of fun in the sun and for the students to express creativity, and teachers shouldn't take that away.

First, it's summer break, three months away from school and teachers. The students should be allowed to come up with a way to combine summer and school. All year the teachers drone on and give homework and projects the student had no say in, so its the student's turn to show their creativity and make a project all their own. Giving students this freedom would make the project less boring and painful. It would also inspire them to actually do it instead or them just not caring about it. They get to make something their own. They can do whatever they please with the project. They can make those three months of freedom worth while with a fun project.

Additionally, the teachers would make the project more school related and for a class they will never take again. The student could make the project about the next class they are taking based on research they found from the local library or online. They could visit their dream college and do a report on that. Something the student genuinely cares about. Students don't want to do projects or care about school over summer. They can compromise with the teacher about the project and make it. It can be a big responsibility test, but a fun one. The teacher should trust the students to make fresh and fun ideas on their own instead of forcing another boring school project.

Finally, the projects from teachers requires a single trip to a store and staying inside all summer. They did that enough in school, now is the time for the students to show the teachers what they can do and what they can come up with on their own. The students should be able to go outside and see what they can do with the things they find in nature. They could make a fun, outdoor adventure instead of a boring essay or poster board with little to no creativity or color. Teachers would get more out of the teacher for creativity and personality than something they threw together last minute. As students get older, they want more freedom and rights. They want to be equals with their teachers. Teachers always say they want students to show creativity, so let them.

In conclusion, the students need to pick their projects. For creativity, freedom, and responsibility. Teachers should let their students have creative control over the project. The students should be allowed to do whatever they please over break. It's summer, they should have some fun with it.
