I do not agree with the principals decision. What if you dont want to do them, or do not have enough time? Does the principal even have the power to do that? I dont think that the principal can force kids to take an extracurricular activity, that just adds to their schedule. Adding another class or activity can make kids not want to go to school. I think that the principal's decision is bad because, Most kids already have activities that take up the whole day. If the person is bad at sports and art for the yearbook they shouldnt have to do it. If they don't like the activities then they shouldn't be forced to go.

Certain kids have chosen a lot of classes for the school year that take up the whole day. Or just have too much work or after school things to add another thing to do. For example majority of kids take honor role, or advanced classes. Secondly some people just have trouble with their classes, and adding another extracurricular activity can mess up their schedule or make it harder for them. Lastly most kids wouldn't even have time to do an extra class, along with their other classes. So how would they fit it in their schedule?

Some kids find some activities hard to do. Then they couldnt be able to add and extracurricular activity to their schedule. For instance sports, their is that one group of kids that are either nonathletic or just bad in general. Secondly a lot of kids are just bad at art and cant figure out how to properly paint or draw. Finally if forced to do an activity that can be hard for them, can make going to school not fun. If they cant do the activity, and find it hard, that would just make the whole school year harder for them.

What if the kids do not like the activities? Then what would they do? If the kids do not like any of the activities then they wouldn't want to go to any of them. For instance if the person finds the activity boring they wouldn't want to go to it, and try to find a way out. Next if some kids hate sports or art, then they would be stuck in a class that they hate or don't know what to do all year long. Lastly maybe the person is just is bad at it, then they would just not like it, and hate it every time they had to go to the class.

I dont agree because most kids do not have time for it, or they could just be bad at the activity and shouldn't be forced to go to it. If people dont like the extracurricular activities then they shouldnt be forced to go. So then the principals decision is not called for, and not necessary. If they add another activity to the day it would just stress out people, and everyone would just dislike school. What if you do not want to do it? Do you even have enough time? Is the principal even able to do that?
