The principal suggests that all students must do at least one extracurricular activity during the school year. He wants all students to do something instead of wasting their time doing pointless things or even nothing at all. I agree with him that students should at least do one activity so they arent wasting their time on something that doesn't matter.

If this rule were to take action,students could possibly find something that they like or even love to do,whether it be sewing,running,singing,etc. It could even be their new passion for them to do at school,home,or somewhere else. This could cause the student to get out more because of this passion or passions,they could share their ideas with people who don't know much about the activity, but want to take part in it with the student or other people. Some students see some activities and find them to seem fun,but when actually participating in the activity, their thoughts and feelings towards it have changed. This is why students would most likely be able to switch their activity to something else that they think they'd enjoy more, letting them experience something better and more fun instead of keeping them somewhere doing something that they don't like.

While the students would be part-taking in these activities,they could possibly meet new friends for them to spend their time with later on and even during the activity. The new friends the students meet along the way could enjoy the activity with them and sometimes they may even help the student along the way with things they are scared or confused about. This could boost the student's happiness as well, because they now know that they are no longer alone. The parents of the students would most likely be happy about their child is participating in something and is also making friends. The parents would also be very proud and happy that their child isn't just sitting around doing nothing. Since the parents were always busy with their child home,they would now have some alone time and relax knowing their student is participating in other things out of the house.

Some students hold onto things that they like or love a lot,so most of the students who really enjoy their activity could possibly bring it with them as they got older. This could mean the students could make a career out of these activities if they were good enough at doing them,they could even go as far as showing these activities to their kin and teaching them how to do it. They could even get their kin to continue what the students had started when they are gone. Some students wouldn't be able to do some of these activities due to financial problems or just time itself, so they would be able to do it at school and maybe continue it outside of school if they ever had the opportunity. The school could even give the student a few things to continue it outside of school,raising the students' happiness.

In all reality,majority of the students would be be happy,considering that they now have something fun for them to do. These activities may seem small to them or anyone at first,but they could really change the students life for the better.

So in conclusion,I agree with the principal that students should start doing extracurricular activities,because it can change the students' lives or possibly just make it better if they are going through stressful or hard times. Some students could even make that activity a tradition for many years to come.
