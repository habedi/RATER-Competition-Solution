Have you even seen the Grand Canyon, even if it was just on television you know that without a doubt, its real, its not camera magic or computer generated terrain. This "face" on mars is nothing more that a natural landform, no alien monument, no NASA hiding something its just a natural landform, just like the Grand Canyon.

So, why is this so important? Well lets say this is an "alien monument" so if it is why wouldnt there be dead bodies on mars or more faces like this one, because this is not an alien monument, its not a corpes its a Mesa just like the ones that we have on earth.

This really can not be anything more than just a natural landform due to the fact that in 2001 NASA took a picture of it and now it doesnt look anything like a face now it just looks like a little hill on the ground. Honestly the seventies were a really superstitious time. So I could see where they saw a face in it, but that doesnt change the fact that in 1976 their camera quality was bad. Even the 1998 picture was starting to reveal that it was just nothing more than a mesa that is certian conditions looks like a face.

Today there have been studies that prove the human brain sometimes has a tendency to make inanimate objects look like a face, in fact today I say a face in the bumper of a car, but I still know that all that was, was a bumper of a car. I honestly understand some theories but this is just downright non sense.

If it was an alien monument NASA would release it because then they would get really popular. So with all of these reasons combined it proves that this is just natural landform. It always will be.
