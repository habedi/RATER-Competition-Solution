The new technology to read human facial expressions might be a little too much. It might say your emotion is one but your not feeling that emotion and then it will just throw you off. But if we could use it just for pictures, and projects in schools, that might be a bit more intresting.

Say if we got this new technology in our schools today it might not always be correct then throw some students off, or it could become very distracting and take away from the students learning. Todays kids are so involve with technology and it shouldn't really be mixed in with our schools as much because students just become distracted" "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrcutor." " What if the coomputer reads the wrong emotion that the student is feeling and then it wouldn't give them the correct lesson. But if we used it for school related projects then that might help with the students learning and engage them more.

In conclusion it wouldn't be the best solution to use this technology to read students emotions, becaue it might not always work, and students can become distracted easily. But if we could use it for projects or to do research then that might be a way that students can use it for studies.
