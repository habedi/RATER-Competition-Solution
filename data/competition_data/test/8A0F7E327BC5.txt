I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity so they can experience social skills, learn to be independent, and have the opportunity to learn new things. Students should come to school and want to learn, want to go to class and do fun things. Having the chance to be involved on an extracurricular activity can bring students excitement and joy. School should not only be a place to learn but have fun times as well. There are many things a student can do at school and have good social skills, be independent, and learn new things.

Everybody learns social skills at some point. Some may be a natural, or some may struggle a bit. Extracurricular can help some students learn that it's OK to talk. Going to that extra class can let them know it's OK to come out of your comfort zone and it's not scary once you get used to it. Social skills are important, and having the opportunity to bring it up is amazing.

Having independence as a kid can be tough. We all rely on our parents to do it all for us. Well thats another reason I think every student should do at least one exreacurriculum. It gives students the chance to make their own decisions without anyone telling them otherwise. Independence is important just like food is important for our health.

It's hard to learn new things, especially when you dont like change. Although it may be hard, it's good for them in many ways. Having students participate in an extra curriculum can benefit their knowledge on something they may not know much about.

Not only will it benefit their knowledge but their skills as well. Learning new things is important, for many reasons such as having the ability to know more, or even learn a new skill you never thought you could learn.

In conclusion, schools should make the diction that all students should at least participate in at least one extra curriculum during school. Not only will it benefit them in multiple ways but teach them things such as social skills, independence, and the ability to learn new things.
