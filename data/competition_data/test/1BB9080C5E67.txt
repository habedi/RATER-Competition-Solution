I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, for students can learn to be more social, learn new skills, and encourage students in school. Being in no extracurricular activities is like being a baseball with no bat; no fun!

First, students can learn to be more social. For example, meeting a new girl at school and your wearing a new pair of shoes and she walks up to you and goes, "I really like your shoes, where did you get them?" They would have to be able to talk back to him or her. Obviously you do not just ignore someone. Whether you are too nervous to talk, you will be constantly communicating in your extracurricular activity all the time so that would be something students learn. Which is talking to new and different people. Some would say bringing you out of your "shell."

Also, students can learn new skills from being in a extracurricular activity. Like playing a sport such as soccer you would be learning how to kick the ball, building higher endurance from running. Or maybe other students would like to be in a real council one day you could join the student council and learn and talk all about it. There are many extracurricular activities you can join so the students certainly have options.

Then, doing extracurricular activities can encourage students in school. Behavior wise, you wouldn't want to be disrespectful and let the coach or teacher make you do anything extra as punishment. Students would always be keeping up with their grades because of the fact that they could get kicked out of that activity. Students would probably show up to school more often because of the extracurricular their in they cannot miss too many days.

However, not all students have the time of day to participate in these extracurricular activities for whatever reason. Possibly, no ride home, but there will always be an activity bus to come pick them up. Or maybe the students are babysitting after school. I think that you would need to participate in some kind of extracurricular activity or even try your best to.

Finally, extracurricular activities can bring so much more fun into your life. Whether its playing a sport or joining the student council make sure it is something that you enjoy. So I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, for students can learn how to socialize, learn new skills, and encourage students in school
