The "face" on Mars is just a natural landform. The face on Mars is nothing more than a huge rock formation and is definatly not created by aliens.

The face is an amazing discovery that NASA has made when they went to Mars. The face is just a landform that can have the illusion of a face. The illusion is created by shadows giving the look of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture of the face that gave a much sharper look of it than the first pictures ever taken. That's when they truly discovered that the face was not a alien monument. Later they have got an even better picture. The picture shows is landforms that are like the ones around the American West. The face was like a butte or a mesa.

Pictures proved that the face is nothing more than a illusion created by shadows. The face is a natural land mark that is like some of the ones on earth. The face is not created by aliens. After all who knows if there is such thing as aliens.
