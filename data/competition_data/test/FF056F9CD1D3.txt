In today's society, we rely on technology tremendously. Going from paper notes and assignments to having everything saved online and portable, many opportunities have been created to make life easier and more comfortable. Life may be more comfortable, but there are many drawbacks to relying solely on technology. While learning from home may sound pleasant, the drawbacks of online learning far outweigh the benefits. Not having a teacher present, having nobody to enforce rules, and having no opportunities to socialize with peers are just some of the reasons why learning from home is not as efficient as learning in school.

Having teachers to talk to face to face provides a greater advantage to students by enabling them to have one on one sessions regarding material learned in class. Having a teacher to talk to in class about an assignment or simply reviewing new material that was learned is not something easily replicated in online learning. Going over missed questions on tests or quizzes, and receiving feedback helps the student to learn from their mistakes. Being face to face with a teacher provides personalized feedback, where the teacher can easily tell a student areas that need improvement, or areas that can be reinforced.

Having the opportunity to learn from home is great, but being too comfortable may lead the student to procrastinate. There is no reason to wake up early to get ready for school; students essentially run on their own schedules, and do not have to worry about being late to school. While running on their own schedules may seem great, it would not be hard to take advantage of the fact that they operate on their own time. Not having a set schedule enforced leads the student to believe they can complete assignments given to them whenever. Not getting in trouble by an authority figure contributes to the mentality of doing work whenever, and not being concerned about repercussions.

An advantage to going to school are the peers, and learning to socialize. Socializing is a skill that is essential to the workforce or any career the student chooses to pursue. Collaborating with others shows the student complex ways to think of a solution, and meeting people with different backgrounds exposes the student to cultures they can learn about. Maintaining healthy relationships is a skill that is important to learn about as the student goes on in life, and learning to deal with different situations gives the individual future experience. Being able to function with a team, and efficiently communicate ideas to each other will provide numerous advantages in the workforce and in life.

The experience gained from being in school teaches students important life lessons, such as socializing, communicating efficiently, and time management. These are all qualities that many employers look for in individuals, and not having these skills may put one at a disadvantage. High school is the time when students learn to make new friends, find out who they are as individuals, and branch off to explore new hobbies. While learning from home sounds wonderful, the experiences made from being at school are ones that you can not replicate at home.
