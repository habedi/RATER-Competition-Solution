In this excerpt the authour seems to be pretty convinced that we need to study venus and see if it is sustainable for human life.

The reasons that we may need to visit venus is that our earth could run out of food or the air could get to polluted to the point were we wont be abel to go outside and breath fresh air. This is why they are resorting to venus. Now venus might not be substainalbe for human life but thats why we need to go so that we can figure out because what happens when the bad does whappen what is earths plan B. They are also interested because at one point they belive that it was just like earth with flowing rivers, grassy mountains and blue skyes. This is why they are so intreged because it seems to be the closes thing we have if our planent was to get destroyed or we couldnt live on it anymore.

Now venus does have some bad things to it like very acidic rain and that would not be good for our lifestyle everyting we had would be ruined so what would the point even be somepeople may ask. NASA stated that there are way around this like metal roofs and thicker roofs if not metal. But some people may ask whats the point if your house could be damaged over all of this well i think that its better than being dead.

Now not going to say that we will need venus anytime soon but it is in the thought process for many scientist so i think that it would be a good idea to fund venus trips because it could happen to my children or grandchildren.
