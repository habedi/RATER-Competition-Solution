Some schools let students design projects to do during the summer while others only let teachers design projects. In my opinion I think we should really only let students design projects during the summer. Students designing projects usually leads to lots of new ideas and it can help teens be more creative during the summer and it gives them some freedom in deciding what they want to do. For example lets say i'm in high school and its up to a group of students to decide,well, I can make up something very nice like planting trees or maybe doing something for charity or do both even because its our project. Students don't need to be held to a certain project thats out of their control.

One reason why student led projects would be a very good thing is you can get a group of diverse students and generate different ideas that 1 person could've never thought of. The students can discuss with each other different ideas and different things to do when and see where it leads them. Lets say you have a Hispanic person in your group maybe he would throw in the idea of helping some immigrants in need, the group could then go and help them the way they see fit. Another plus would just be the shear amount of ideas that a group of lets say 10 teens can have all ranging from different things. You can't get this same level of productivity with only 1 or 2 teachers.

Now we move onto student creativity and how it helps them more than just having a teacher assign them something. This kind of falls in line with the previous paragraph but not really because this is a very different thing.

Creativity is something you just can't have when a teacher picks whatever they want you to do because there isnt much room for creativity. Furthermore if it is student designed then the students can do almost anything they want when they want. For example a normal project designed by an adult would be like picking up garbage or helping an orphanage. A student led project could do that same thing but do it differently, like instead of helping prep food or whatever they can get these kids toys or go to the orphanage and paint some walls and just let out their inner creativity, instead of just doing something basic and boring with no spice.

The last but definitely not the least reason why student led projects are better than teacher led projects is student freedom. Student freedom may not sound like such a big deal but it is,teens specifically want freedom the most,they wanna do things their own way without an adult to tell them how. This can drastically improve morale in concerns to doing the project in the first place because its their decision on what they want done. Leaving the decision up to teenagers is a good idea because like stated before they can think up some brilliant ideas with no restrictions or a certain guideline to follow and overall it makes everyone happier knowing they can do whatever they want and it even helps the teacher because the all the teacher has to do is oversee some of the stuff they do but thats it they don't need to think of anything to do because the students got it all covered.

In conclusion I think both sides have some pretty good arguments like teachers saying teens arent responsible enough to design projects on their own but, I think this assertion is wrong because adults underrate the creativity and responsibility of teens. Overall teens who design their own projects lead to better things than teacher projects because they are just more fun, creative and different. In the future I hope I get to do a student led project because it seems like so much fun to do with freedom and creativity from my peers.
