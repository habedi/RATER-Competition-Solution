Many schools set up summer projects to provide students with opportunities to learn during the summer. I think these projects should be designed and managed by students and supervised by teachers. The summer projects are a perfect opportunity for students to learn real world skills, give back to the community, and feel accomplished about their work. I believe that although, the students should set up most of the projects, they are still kids and need an authoritative figure sometimes. It is important to provide students with opportunities to broaden their knowledge.

The summer projects should be designed and run by the students. This will teach them how to complete everyday tasks and learn real world skills. The students may even feel more accomplished because they may realize the amount of work needed to design those type of projects. They would know that they didn't just help carry out the project but, that they set the whole thing up. I think if the students were able to choose what projects they were interested in most, more students would come out to help.

Another reason they should be student run is because they could see first hand see how their projects help the community. They would know that they were giving back. To organize the projects they would have to talk to the organizations or people that the project involved. They would believe that their project would make a real difference and isn't just set up to get students out of the house during summer. They could be more invested in their work because of the newly formed connections with people that they made.

Although, I believe the projects should be student run, I still believe that they should be supervised by teachers. They are still kids and might not all get along. Even though many of the students could be invested in the project there might be a few that would mess around. They would still need an authoritative figure to push them in the right direction. There also will be more complicated topics that come into play; like dealing with money. The students just wouldn't have dealt with those issues at such a level before and might not know where to start. The teachers would help guide the students in the right direction.

I believe the summer projects should be designed and run by the students but supervised by teachers. These projects are a great opportunity for kids to learn real world skills and become more invested in their work. Even though the projects are a great opportunity for students to learn to work together to solve problems, there would be some issues that would need to be handled by an authoritative figure or someone that has more real world experience. It is very important to give students many opportunities to learn and witness leadership, teamwork, and overall the real world. These projects are a great opportunity for students and should not only help them learn about the community or book facts but also should help them learn life lessons and how to work with each other.Â
