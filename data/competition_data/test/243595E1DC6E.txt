Driverless cars are not safe they are not safe because the car is driving it's self, but a human still has to be holding the wheel. There could be more accidents like this then normal. People are not going to be able to drive if it comes to the point where all cars are driverless some people would agree, and some would disagree like in this story. The cars can only handle driving functions up to 25mph how it says in paragrapgh seven. Some states also dont like the fact that there are driverless cars.

In some of the states it is illegal to do a computer test on the cars this is stated in paragraph nine. Some of the cars have been driverless since 2009, but not all the way. If there's an accident it would be the technology, technology is always not correct. This is not a good idea some of the people would get bored how Dr. Werner Huber said.

Driverless cars would change the world how it's stated in the first paragraph. Why drive then? Why not ride a taxi, bus, or train instead of having a car that you can not drive. They should not make every car this way just some, and leave the rest how they are. That way there won't be arguments with other people.
