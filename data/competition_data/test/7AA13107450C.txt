Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. If your looking at the furthing fact of us humans. It would be a great take on futhuring our lives becoming a smarter race. Although its mostly negatives coming out of Venus. Its still possible which for some people thats all it takes.

Venus, " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus". With a stunning tempature "average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit". Also with a daily eruption of volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightining. Venus now Venus is a very very dangerous task. But NASA however, has came up with a brilliant idea, with a solution to the horrible conditions for humans. They beleive that humans would never even have to come to the planet completely to do thier research. NASA has developed a vehicle that would hover above the mess that is Venus."30 or so miles" above. It comes with a kick though, with the high tempatures of Venus regardless of how high they are there will be a tempature of 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Very dangerous but yet very possible.

What the author was overall trying to explain is that taking on a planet like Venus is very dangerous but yet very possible. Overall in the longrun it would benifit NASA more importantly the human race. But the journey is very harsh with scorching tempatures and daring weather, a high chance of failure. Yet still possible in furthring the world. In conclusion thier is many risk yet the chance that we'll benifit and come out very sucessful is the chance we will take is what the author is trying to explain.
