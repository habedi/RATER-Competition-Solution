My opinion on driverless cars is that they would be cool and very neat. The downfall is what if this car the car malfuctions? What if the car if now whats its cracked up to be?

I would say for the driveless cars is a job idea. I say this because it will cause less accidents based off of people letting going of the wheel. Or simply becuase of people not paying attention to the road. This way people would have the lead way to tlk and text while on the road for long periods of time. Also the road would know the road so you could just lay back and relax.

Lastly, the downfall of this is the first driveless car could be very expensive, so not many people are going to have a first. In the end, others companies will learn how make the car and better and better. The future is holding in this invention.
