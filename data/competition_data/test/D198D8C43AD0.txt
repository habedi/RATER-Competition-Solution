Introduction

Kids already spend there whole day at school, why do they have to do afterchool activities?

I think that students should not have to do participate in after school activities,Because school is very challenging already. Nevertheless it will cost them time out of homework,sports,and could lead to stress . kids have there own opinion too. In general after school activities should be a responsibility not a duty.

More Stress

Most kids in our age already deal with stress. Image what would staying after school to do something you don't like to do will do to most of the kids that are stressed out. More than 63 percent of people are stressed out in my age according to studies. Afterschool would just make It worse, mostly If you dont like any of the activities that they run. Finally I really disagree with this topic,because I have stayed after before in my school and I didn't really like it,I thought it was a waster of time,cause it ended at 5 and we get out at 2:15.

Lack of time

We all know that one excuse that we all have used before it's called "I didn't have time". To be honest with you I think that this would be a waste of time for some people,and super crowded. Mostly everyone wouldnt really participate cause they would be complaining that this is a waste of time. Also people might not take it seriously and skip it or find a way out of after school activities. In my opinion kids should be doing what they want to do like, watch TV,play sports,hangout with friends,and much more. It could also effect teachers plans and grading time and there whole schedule.

Conclusion

In general after school activities should be a responsibility not a duty. People in my opinion dont have to be force to do stuff they dont want to do. Kids also have stuff to do outside of school just like every other person. In conclusion I think this after school decision wouldnt work out because people would find ways out of staying after school.
