I think that everyone shoulkd be a part of Seagoing Cowboys because, not only if you join this program you will see and go to places you have ever been before .There is more to this program than just going to a place and seeing it just to see, but to go and learn and help the people that are having problems with the things they may or not need. The adventure that we go on are eye opening. Helping around the places we go are very fun but can also dangerous . Even though your on a boat or ship you can find fun in spare time.

There are also benefits of going places around the world like Europe and China. Other places that benefits you is Greece you can see the Acropolis, and more. The most speacial thing of all is the bond that you make with the people in the the places that you go to. Some people in the program bond with each other because there are 44 nations. As in addtion to my statement there are a lot of people and things that the peole need ,an if those people could change places with use they would do the same.

The UNRRA has helped the Seagoing Cowboys programe ship and improve. So I think that every one sould want to be a part of the Seagoing Cowboys.
