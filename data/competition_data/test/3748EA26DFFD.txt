Dear, Principal

Everyday people ask themselves why is doing community service so important. As you may know or not know having community service helps us in everyday life. I believe kids should be able to help our world instead of destroying it. Community Service is such an important thing because it helps each and every one of us become a better person. Additionally, why is Community service such a important thing? Well having community service helps us outgrow and become a better person. You may say why does community service and help our world ?. Actually what community service can do for each and every one of us is help our environment. Everyday in our lives we always see the same thing people littering and not recycling and doing so much to our world that were destroying it every minute in the day that we have to live. Furthermore, Community service can help us out grow ourselves and be more helpful. It can improve of how we live. Some people may say why bother helping the community and waste my life time if i can just stay home and watch T. V. or clean my house. Community service will help you be more outgoing instead of being just plain out lazy.

Some people just stay at home and watch t. v. or just plainly do nothing all day and spend their time on face book or my space all day. As you can see community service will you improve in how you live everyday. Instead of watching t. v. imagine what you can do everyday in the community by helping our world become a better place to us and the future. In conclusion as you can see if student don't have community service imagine what can happen to them. This is why having community service part of our world is so important. It doesn't just helps us it helps our society our world become a better place. Community Service is the best thing we can have everyday.

Sincerely,
