Dear Principal:

Over the past week, I have heard that you might be requiring all students to participate in community service. As our community is relatively dirty, and has a lot of trash and litter everywhere, I certainly think that all students should participate in community service at least once over the school year. I think that the town certainly needs a clean-up and this is a great way to do it. Of course, most students have busy schedules, and may not be able to participate in it on a certain day. As a community, we need to take care of it ourselves and therefore, all students should be required to take part at least once over the year. I would be willing to help you, and maybe could be the assistant in the community service.

The town of LOCATION_NAME has some very disgusting neighborhoods and this causes water pollution, air pollution, and any other type of pollution you can think of. This causes diseases and other sicknesses that could possibly be fatal. Well, as it is our community, I definitely think that we need to do a large pick-up at least several times a year. For example, in the neighborhood of Trianon, families will take out the trash and then it will blow away, and they don't care one bit. If a neighbors pet eats something that blew away, you could get sued and the pet could get very sick.

As some students have a busy schedule, they may not be able to take part in some of the days where we do community service. Therefore, I think you should definitely make ten or more days where students can come out and do something good for the community. I will go out and find who can do what on which days as the assistant in this. From there on, you and I could make a schedule for days on which most kids could do the community service.

Finally, I would be asking you to allow me to be the your assistant in this job. I have done a community service before and know how to get it done properly. To sum it all up, I would love to be your assistant in this, and most certainly think that this town needs several big clean-ups with the help of our students.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
