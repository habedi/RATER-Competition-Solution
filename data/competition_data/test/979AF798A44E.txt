How should a summer project be designed to assure they continue learning over the break? While being asked to write should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed I contemplated over the thought and came to the conclusion there were a plethora ways to create a create a project that would be fine to give to the student over summer break but what's the best project that would make a student want to continue learning over the break? Student-designed projects should be the best option because it would give the student more control over what they decide their project to be and motivate them to continue their learning in a more productive way.

Student-designed projects engages a students mind more by giving them the ability to personalize their project more. The students will have a chance to bring more creativity into their education and be able to put more thought and ponder what they will decide to do with their summer project. Each project will have their own originality based on what each student desires to put in to their project with each person being very unique in their own way the outcome of each project will be interesting. The power of choice will let each student put more in their effort into the assignment because they will have a sense of ownership of their actions;furthermore,The students will take more pride in their work and their education for the summer project because they will feel that put a lot more of themselves in contrast to a teacher-designed summer project.

Student-designed based projects will be more beneficial to the school and our main purpose to make sure our students continue learning during their break. In most schools there will be a percentage of students who wouldnt do the project assigned to them because the project doesn't really enthuse the students. These students who do that see the project as a chore or work to do instead of something more exciting,while on break the students may feel that they want to forget school and education because they want to have fun and experience a nice break. Student-designed projects for the summer would convince the students that its something they can have fun doing and have a passion for learning and education. Student-designed projects benefits the students in the way that makes them want to learn instead of being forced.

Teacher-designed projects might have some benefits to the school to because they use a more stiff and secure design that would make it easier to grade for a large number of students this makes grading easier on the teachers because everybody is doing the same project designed by the teacher. The students will have a clearer guideline and more of a paved road to what they should do and the project may be much simpler to complete depending on the student and their needs because some students may prefer the teacher designing the project. It would be less time just to follow instructions instead of creating your own project by yourself and it would help some students get the project out the way and focus on their break;consequently,student-designed projects are overall more effective for getting students to continue learning during their break.

In conclusion,These summer projects should be student-designed instead of teacher-designed because it requires the students to display more creativity,originality,and take more pride in their personal project,in addition it will encourage more students in the right way to participate and lower the percentage of students who get assigned work but do not do it. student based learning also encourages students to learn by telling them to add their own passion and what they desire to do for the project,making students actually want to learn instead of being forced to do a assignment.
