Recently scientist's have invented what is called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). FACS is a system that can detect what your emotion is, wether you are sad or mad it can detect how you are feeling through your facial expressions. The software can even identify mixed emotions explains Dr. Huang. The software does what people do everyday whether its noticing our friend is upset or knowing your mom is mad by just looking at her. FACS is becoming so popular its even being talked bout to be used in schools. The computers would detect if you are understanding what is being said or if you are confused about what is being said. Personaly I dont think this would be a good idea.

The reason I dont think this would be a good idea is because if the computers are seeing if you are understanding or not that takes away a big part of a teachers and students job. If a teacher notics a student not undertanding they should help the student, but its not only a teachers job its a students job. If a student if feeling confusd they should take it upon them to ask the teacher for help. If a student is not asking for help because they are scared of feeling embarrsed they should know that its okay to ask for help. If schools started using FACS students would never get a chance to come out of there shell and they would stay scared to ask. That would effect them when they leave school and enter the work force. If their boss asks them to do something and they don't undertand there won't be a FACS to detect that and they won't know how to aks for help because they ahve never been exposed to having to ask.

If changing our shcools to having to have computers detect a student isn't understanding we are in trouble. It might help at first but in the long run it would not be a good thing. Asking for help is a great way to learn social skills and not having that chance could make someone have bad social skills. I do not think FACS should be is schools for reasons I have stated.
