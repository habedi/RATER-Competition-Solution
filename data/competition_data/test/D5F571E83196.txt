In "The Challenge of Exporing Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is sometimes called the " Evening Star" this is in paragraph 1 the first sentence. Sometimes referred as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus because Venus is sometimes right around the the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxixde blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the cloudds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and cloud have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. this is why the author suggests that studying the "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
