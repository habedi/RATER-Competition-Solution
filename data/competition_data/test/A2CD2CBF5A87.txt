Students would not benefit from taking online classes from home. In a classroom setting it is easier to focus on the work a person is trying to get done, someone is there to tell you to get your work done, and it is a social skill aid. Some examples of this are that I find it hard to focus on my own, in the book

Throne of Glass the main character Celena is moved from a situation she is familiar with and is distracted by all of the new things, and I have become less shy because of the friends I have made.

It is easier to focus on the work given to a person. In the book

Throne of Glass the main character Celena Sardothien was in a place called Endovier, early on in the book she was removed from that place and moved to a castle. On the way she became very distracted by the things around her and not her task at hand. She needed constant reminders of where she was going and what she needed to do. Once she was reminded she would remember for a day and then the next she would forget. In order for students not to be in the same predicament they need to be in a classroom setting where thy can focus on the work at hand because everyone is working on the same thing.

Someone is there to keep a person on track. In my life I find it hard to focus on a task at hand if I am uninterested in it and tend to procrastinate. In order for me to stay on task I need someone to remind me to do my work. When I am given a project that I have no drive to complete I procrastinate until I can't anymore, some teachers remind their student s that there is a project due and that they need to finish it. When I am in those classes I tend to do the best because I am always on top of my work. There have been projects where I forget about them until the last day and then I start to work on them, most of the time I am not proud of the work that I do on those projects. So other students don't end up in the situations I have by procrastinatingÂ they should stay in a classroom so they always know when something is due.

Being in a classroom is a social skill aid. Over the years I have been in public school I have become less shy due to the amount of interaction that I must do to complete certain tasks, such as, group projects. Through those experiences I have made many friends, I even have some friends that I have known since first grade. Through these friends I have come out of my shell and I have become more confident. Through my friends I have learned that it is ok to be weird and that they will support me through any tough times. There have been situations where I have needed to help my friends interact with people and I have used the social skills that I learned in school through dealing with mean and rude teachers and in some cases rude students. Students should stay in a public classroom setting because of the valuable social skills thy will learn there that will help them out in their lives.

Students should be in a public classroom setting to develop their social skills and get reminded about the work that they need to focus on. Some may disagree with this statement but they have not thought about all of the experiences that kids would be missing out on if they took online classes. Students should not take their online classes from home.
