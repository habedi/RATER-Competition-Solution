To the Principal:

I think that students should attend community service because that can keep them doing productive things and not getting into trouble, not being bored but doing something to help out, doing community service could keep kids going if it were a paying position or added extra credit to their grades whether or not they are good or bad performances. I think the principal should make the decision to require all students to perform community service because it will help them exceed in life and to not give up. To keep students interested in performing community work is to schedule it to where everyone is with their friends having fun and also taking part in management. Having students do community work is a great way to teach them to manage well, to not give up when something is hard, having those certain people around to push and motivate every student there when seen to be in struggle of working. Helping the community is also a good thing to do, you want to be proud of your neighborhood and satisfy the people that you share the community with, it feels good to know, hey, I helped someone do this or that, or Yeah, I put a smile on this persons face. Require community service, it's good for the students. Students that believe community work is a waste of time, they're wrong because helping your community is worth the time taken up and the work put into the community, if no one was willing to help out with the communities, they'd all look awful, dirty and not cared about, no one wants to live in a place where its all dirty and nasty, and full of litter, and dirt. The kids that don't care for community service aren't doing anything better and they know it. They're either sitting at home bored, wasting time, or taking unto actions that could completely throw their lives away, such as drugs, vandalism, stealing, being disrespectful, joining a gang of such. When they could be doing something way more productive helping out the community, making new friends, meeting new people, feeling good about themselves, learning different things as well. It says that children must attend school until the age of 16, so the principal adding community service to the school requirements, will keep children going in life until, they run out of juice, completely. It shall be a mandatory thing for all students, grades K-8.
