Dear Principal,

As a student, I do not think it is a good idea to change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I think the rule should be for a grade C average. Many have a grade C average and are still trying their hardest! Excluding them from activities will not improve their grade if they're incapable of it. A grade C is average! Why should the average student not be allowed to participate in anything? Maybe they get nervous during tests, or have trouble with writing. They're still trying.

Another reason why I think it is a bad idea is you would lose a lot of extra activities because nobody was there to participate in them! A drama club can't just have one actor in it, they would not be able to do anything. In a way, you'd be preventing many more students from participating in these activities. Some students may of had mostly B' s and their average was brought down by just one bad grade.

Also, sports and other activities aren't always the reason why some students have a lower grade average. They may be under a lot of stress or have troubles at home. The activities actually might help them calm down a little. Those are the reasons why I think you should not change the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Thank you, and I hope you take these ideas into consideration.

Sincerely ,

Your student
