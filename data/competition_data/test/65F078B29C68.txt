Dear Principle,

I have noticed that students love to call and text their friends. I have thought about it and I agree, I also enjoy to communicate and get in touch with friends, but I do not agree when students are calling during school hours. I don't agree with cell phone usage, it should not be allowed at school because cell phones will get other students distracted from school work, students will pay more attention to their phones instead of school work and school is a place for learning, not cell phones.

Even though students will not be able to use them during class time, it doesn't mean they still can't be distracted by them. Young students such as teens, considering I am one, will talk even more during class time from the conversations they had with their friends. Not only will the teacher become frustrated, but so will some of the students who are trying to pay attention and understand the lesson. I would know this because I already have classmates who text during class and rudely interrupt the teacher and their fellow piers by their goofy giggles and I do personally get annoyed.

When students text or call their friends, it's not just a five minute thing that happens and just goes away like a fluttering butterfly. Actually, no where near that. Students will concentrate on what gossip is going on or what your boyfriend gave you for your birthday, this severe problem will not stop unless we actually do something to change it other than just taking that rule away. I think that we should just keep this school the way it is. We are an "A" school and that's just how I like it.

School is a place for learning, not cell phone usage. We go to school for one reason and one reason only, to learn. Our parents want us, the students, to grow up and become successful. That is what they want most of all. And if we ignore them and our teachers what will we have after college, if some students even go to college, we will have nothing. Students would have been to busy paying attention to their phones instead of the lesson that we will be tested on.

I agree that we should just rule out that possibility and stay in the safe zone. It will be better for the parents, teachers, and especially the students. This is why I agree we should not have cell phone usage during school hours at any time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
