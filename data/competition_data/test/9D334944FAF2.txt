I think that if students have access to attend classes from home it would be really helpful in many ways .They would not be distracted by friends and other things, they would pay more attention in what they are doing and they would be able to do all their work and have better opportunity s on learning more in a easy way.

Many students have different ways to learn,study and also get their work done in many ways such as,some students likes to learn and study in a quiet place where there is no distractions and there is no people around, and in a class where they feel comfortable in and they know they can express their self in many ways and they know that they are not going to struggle a lot because they would be able to ask questions and they would get help if they need to .There are students that they can learn and study in a class where they are many noises and distractions and might struggle a little and they would be able to get their questions answered if they need help on something but they would still do all their work and everything that they need to do to have good grades. I think that we should have a choice where we can choose if we want to take our classes online or in school,because we all learn and struggle in different ways. and I know that students would like to have the opportunity to take their classes online,and they are going to take a really good advantage of doing their classes online, and would be more comfortable on the choice that they are going to make.

As a student i would choose the choice of taking my classes online because i know that i would be taking a really good advantage if my school would let me have access to attend classes from home,because Im the type of student that learns more when Im by my self in a quiet place where i know i can get all my work done and study and not get distracted, but i know that if Im in a place where are many people talking and would get distracted easily and i would not be able to get all my work done.
