Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But the good option for students is to attend at school because if they take the option to attend school online classes at home. students will not benefit from online classes, students will just spent time on video games, and students will not be successful.

The first reason is that students will not benefit from online classes because it is not the same when they attend at school. Student can learn more there, in other words students pay attention to teachers. For example, in my case I can not learn more in online classes at my home because when I open the computer to do the class work or activities, I just get stress and I do not focus on them because there is no teacher who can tell me to pay attention. And because it is not the same when I am attend at school classes. In school I learn more things because when I do not understand something I ask for help to my teachers. I can say that I benefit more there than attending to school online classes at my home and also students can get more benefit by attending at school.

The second reason is that students will just spend time on video games instead of doing their class work or activities of school online class. For example, when I open my computer the first thing I like to do: is watch video games, play games, or watch movies like Disney. For these reasons I spent a lot of my time there, it is something difficult to me to focus on the online classes. Do online classes is hard for students because there are things that can distract students and they will not focus to learn or to the activities. They will just spend time on other things, as a result they will not be prepared for the next level of learning. Attending to school is something different because school has rules for students and teachers who can teach us personally, there is no excuse to learn, and there is no thing that can distract us from class work because teachers will be there watching us if we do our class work or activities.

Additionally, some people says that students will be more success by attending school online classes because they think technology has more advances in the word and that can help students to find answers to respond the questions and they can learn more. However they are incorrect, because in this case they considerate students less intelligent. Students can be successful by attending at school and not by attending online classes at home. As a students we can learn more at school classes, our teacher will always advise us to study to get a great grade and also they advise us to read books because there are lessons that can teach us: about life, about failure, and about success and that make students more smart. On that way we will progress on our life to achieve our goals.

In conclusion, it is better to attend at school because students will be prepared for the exterior world. If students attend to school online classes at home they will not have the desire to learn or to study. They can think " there is no teacher who can tell us to do our class work so we can go outside with our friend."

It is the sad reality and I am the first one who ca do the same. That the reasons that students can not benefit from online classes, students will just spend time on video games, and they will not be successful.
