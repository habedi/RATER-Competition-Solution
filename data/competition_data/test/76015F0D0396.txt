Street parking and garages have been forbidden for a while. only way you would have a garage was if you purchased one with your home. there were only two places you could park at and thats really only for two cars.

Paris banned people from driving there cars , up to 4,000 people were fined , so most of everybody car was impounded. to me there losing money because the amount of people that buy gas for there cars if you think about it thats a big lost how many people in paris drive cars theres going to be a big percentage of the money gone due to this car ending madness. some deleivery places couldnt even have cars so its messing up their money too.

Car Free Day I find strange because no one can drive . its too many people in the world everyone if not going to fit on the busses they have , due to this tragic people have to now walk where they have to go. If you dont have a bike or skateboard then your out of luck so since this happened no one really got where they needed to be. I think even people had to miss work for this , also the kids . how would they get to school ? to me banning cars would be the dumbest idea anyone ever made up. this world would come to a end without cars.

In America people in driving population goes up by the hour , like when you travel you go more miles than you think you do. most people in America have stopped driving and start travling by bus. with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result they may find less reason to resume the habit.
