The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be somehow valuable, it depends who is getting a benefit from it and how the person who is being reading its expressions would feel, but in my personal opinion, I do not find it any value in a classroom.

I can imagine this system in my classroom, I would not behave freely and I think my classmates would be too. When we are in the classroom, we. some us, are there to learn and I admit that sometimes I do not understand not even a bit of the teaching lesson, and this system would benefit us because the teacher will know if we need to be more claryfied when this technology tell him how we feel about the subject, but what if we do not have our mind in the classroom and we would like some privacy, of course we will not have it, and everyone will know our deepest feelings. All of us deserve privacy, and not for only our own good. If we have some doubts and we need help, we would ask the teacher. Some of us do not do it, and might it be for a reason or we just have another source of information, we like to be independent.

If would have to argue where this system would be more valuable, I will not say some where. Everyone is free to express or not express themselves. I think that any reasonable or not reasonable person will agree with me. The use of this technology is valuable depending its purpose, and I find some advantages; when we need help and we do not know how to ask for it, and disvantages; if we are not sure if we really want it, and it is our own job to resolve our problems. There is always pros and cons.

When in school, college; learning, we are still developing skills, and to reach them we have to work for ourselves, we have to be independent and find our pathways. And with this,

I conclude that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not necessary, not valuable.
