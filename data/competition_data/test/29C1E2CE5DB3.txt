Attending clases in online will not be affective compare to taking clases at school. Students focus more in school because teachers are cheking on them all the time. At home students could assealy get distracted by video games or other staffs. Also not all students will take online clases seriously beause it will be more eassy for them to skep classes.

Attendding classes at school is more combinent for students because in school students can make friends. Share with new people. In school students can be able to make projects in groups wich they migh not be able to do in online classes. If teachers assing students projects, the school most of the times provides students supplies that they need for projects: like books, computers, and others. Also students can get help from other classmates or from other teachers at school. At school this is a way that makes education more fun and interesting when theres other people around us to help or to get help from them.

There are many clases that need to be done fisicly. One of the subjects is P.E class wich is more practical. Another can be sciens classes where students get to learn a lot by doing experiments with chemicals or other materials. For example in biology where students used mycroscophics to learn about cells. This are clases than won't be benefit taking them in online. Because acivities like experiments will not be able to do and theres a lot that students will not going to learn or experimented.

School has a lot of opportunities like programs or clubs that online classes won't offert. Academy's are one of the most benefit courses that students can have at school.

A lot of students are depending in these courses that Academy's provide. This classes has to be taken in school because there so much that has to be learn by activites in gruop. Also like photography class it would be worthy that students take classes like this in online. This are classes more practicals is not just concepts. Same with art class and music class.

In conclution attending classes in online will not be productive as taking classes in school. Because school offerts so much more than online classes. Also School opens a lot of help and clubs and resourse you need for education. Therefor students shoul not choose for attending classes in online because they have more opportunities at school.
