Exploring Venus is an extremly dangerous idea but NASA continues to send unmanned space crafts, according to paragraph 2.

If its so dangerous is there reasoning behind wanting to learn more about this red hot planet?

Is there a chance that something could possibly live there again?

Venus, a planet that is much like our own in many ways, is a very dangerous yet mysterious place.

NASA says that at one point, according to paragraph 4, Venus could have been largely covered by oceans.

Meaning that if it had water there is a slight chance that Venus could have inhabbited living things such as plants or bacteria.

So now that NASA believes that there is a possibility that life could have occured on Venus at one point in time, why would they want to continue to explore it.

If Venus had life on it some point in the past then there is a possibility that there could still be something there or that maybe even one day in the far future something could live there again, possibly including the human species.

Then instead of vacationing to another country for a break you could vacation to an entirely different planet.

If they continue to explore they could figure out so much more about this planet and possibly what we could do to save Venus and be able to have oceans and landforms and living creatures back on our sister planet.
