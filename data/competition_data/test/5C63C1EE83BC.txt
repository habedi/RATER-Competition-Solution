The way of seeing how kids feel in a class room, this new technolgy shows it all. Will this change teaching and everything else in the class room, lets find out.

Professor, Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the Universty of Illinois, working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe of the Universty of Amsterdam. Are construction a computer with a 3-D computer model of the face; it uses all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, this is called an "action unit".

I support this idea and here is why I do. This will show very high improvement in class rooms, as this it will show how a kid can learn, if they are happy about this subject and if they are highly entertained, or this could go another way of teaching say we didn't have this type technolgy. A math teacher gives there students a test, the average over all is a 72%, that is not good, a teacher will have to go over the subject again majority due to failing of the subject. Was it the teacher, or was it the students, who will ever know, but if they had the technogly in the room to read their facial expressions, for that the teacher may have post poned the test due to the results of the facial expressions coming back, which could have showed alot of confusion over the section. That could have saved alot of time and get better grades, as they could of not gone back over the section. This would show a lot of improvement in testing scores over all, as teacher would not mine going back over a answer if a student or students or confused what is going.

There are 6 different basic emotions in the system, happiness, suprise,anger,digust,fear and sadness. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

In fact, we humans preform this same impressive "calculation" everyday. We can tell when a friend is happy, or upset, due to how much we around them. Its that this 3-D facial computer system can even tell more when you can't.

If we had this in a class room , this would help so much, schools could see higher test scores and better improvements. I think it would even better if they took this to even more places. Such as Jails, Conceling areas, Thearpists, as it could show in their true emotions, this could be a lie dector, shows the emotions. Say they can't get anything from someone in a jail, they use that, they could see a fear emotion, or a blank emotion, or sad emotion. I just say this could change the future of alot things in every day life. This could also mean that, school corportaions might recieve rewards for really high scores in testing, which could really help out and some schools, for instance my school, we have don't have some of the newest technolgy as some other schools due, and why because i go to a small school, so we don't recieve high standards as other schools around us do. So that is why i agree we should have this newest technolgy and alot of the schools, to suceed in life and to help kids get better.
