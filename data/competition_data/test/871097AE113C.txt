To TEACHER_NAME

Dear TEACHER_NAME I think policy 1 is a good idea to have phones.

I think is good to have a phone during lunch , or if a teacher give us free time we can use are phones. Policy number one is good for us. I think policy number one is cool because we can use them but not on class because it can effect us at are learning and others learners to.

I think policy number 2 is not fare or all the students at are school .

because we have to call are mom after school to come pick us up after school but we don't have are phones. What about if we go walking and somebody is fooling you we can call somebody but wait we don't have our phones. Sea now we need to bring are phones to School but we wont use them on class only at lunch or at free time. We need Policy number one it will help us. We need policy number one for are own good,
