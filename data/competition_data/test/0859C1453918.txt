The advantage of limiting your car use are extremly helpful mainly to are envoriment. Some countries are now banging people from using there vehicals to get the smog levels down. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and ruduce smog.

"It's a good oppotunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" said businessman Carlos Arturo as he road a two-seat bicycle with his wife. In Bogota, Colombia there is a day where everyone has a car-free day. It also releaves on the traffic jams and also reduces the amount of accidents. On that day vioators faced $25 fines, might be a little extreme but its a good way to get the people thinking of new and smarter ways to travel. If in a city of 7 million everyone can join in, why cant states and countries try this?

If we had car-free days maybe once every month or twice a month that would help keep are envirorment heathy and clean. Parks and sports centers would also greatly bloom, more people would want to get out and enjoy life more. Less harm to are earth will make sure it last longer and they way are kids kids can be able to see what a wonderful planet we have.

I feel that less cars should be used, more walking and bike riding less gas more money in are pockets.

The less we stress areself by having to worry about global warming and the more we can worry about injoying life will be better. When we use less and save less that helps the goverment the people the envorment. EVERYONE! Just one time a day we used a bike instead of a car that cuts are pollution in half.
