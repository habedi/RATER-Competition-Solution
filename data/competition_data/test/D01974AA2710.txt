To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME:

I STUDENT_NAME , don't think that having the students make a B average in order to play sports is a good thought.

Some students might be having trouble in math, science, social studies, etc.

If a student has all A' s in his/her class for the exception of math with a 75 average will they still be able to play?

If the student really love's to play a few of the sports the school offers for them why can't they play?

For instance, I myself is all pre-AP classes and am making all A' s and I can still play sports, but my friend RELATIVE_NAME's playing volleyball, basketball, and track she just doesn't understand math.

All her other subjects she gets A' s

She tries and tries to figure it out, but she can't.

RELATIVE_NAME goes to tutoring every morning, she asks me for help, but she still doesn't understand it.

Will she not be able to play sports what so ever?

Can "WE" the students of SCHOOL_NAME create a program where the students can get some kind of extra credit if we play sports?

If "WE" try really hard and get our grades up to at least an 80 average will "WE" still be able to play?

I will even help tutor some of the students I have to.

I personally don't care for the new school policy because I don't think it will be fare for all the students who really want to play any of the sports.

So my vote on this policy will be a thumbs down, straight on NO!

With truthful thoughts,

STUDENT_NAME.
