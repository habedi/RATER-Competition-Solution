My friend had once been forced to be homeschooled due to an illness. She regarded it to me as the worst time of her life. She never liked school ever, but now she wanted to go back more than ever. The difference between homeschool and going to a physical school is drastic. Student's wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home, proving that technology cannot be an direct alternative to going to school.

Student's wouldn't benefit from being to attend classes from home because they wouldn't be able to get help from their teachers. Teachers are vital to a students success. When students struggle with a certain topic, they usually ask a teacher to help them further understand what their learning. Contacting them online rather than in person would only make it more difficult for students as sometimes they need a direct, in person explanation depending on the topic. They also make sure students are focused and are on task as their is no control of that at home. Teachers can also provide fun and creative ways to teach a lesson, rather than the same online and boring lessons. Many students that already struggle with school would only get worse.

Student's wouldn't benefit from being to attend classes from home because they wouldn't be able to be with their friends as much. Friends are a big incentive for kids to come to school as they can help you with problems in class if a teacher is unable to or is busy. Friends can pick you mood up when you're having a bad day. Friends are a big stress reliever as people can express their frustration to them about school, family, etc. They make school more enjoyable and a better experience. School without friends would only make it worse, as it may cause even more boredom to students being alone by themselves.

Student's wouldn't benefit from being to attend classes from home because they would spend more time procrastinating than learning. Many kids struggle even just getting homework done afterschool because they are on their phones, or they can't focus on a screen for too long. Lessons would take longer for students to complete, as in school there's always a teacher to help students stay focused and in check if they're not paying attention. At home, the students are completely independent, which can be difficult for some as they don't have a long attention span. Procastination only leads to unecessarily long work times for students and it can cause them to not produce the best show of work.

In conclusion, technology won't solve every problem as students would struggle even more if they had online school. Although a student's success is dependent on themselves, teachers, friends, and even the school environment can be helpful factors in determining how far they go educationally. Without them, many will struggle and cannot get the help they need to be successful. Education is a huge factor in where people go in life. Most of the time, a good education will get you into a good college which can spring you into a solid career afterwards. Schools should not attempt to create online schools, and should spread awareness to those that are able to come to school but are homeschool, why it's better to have their education at a physical school.Â
