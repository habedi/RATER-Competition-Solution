yes i think that the grade level that she set was good because if the students don't have good grades why should they be able to play sports. Just like when you are a teacher you have to have a degree to be able to teach. And if the grade level is higher the students will want to try harder for sports and everyone's grades will be much better so now the school has a good basketball team and the students have a good "GPA" to so now everybody is happy. And that's why i agree with the principal.

I also disagree with their consideration because not all students are able to meet those standards. And if the students are not willing to try hard work in school then they will no longer have sports for their school. and the students that are willing to try will only have a few amount of players for their team.
