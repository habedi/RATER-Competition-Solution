DEALING OF COMMUNITY SERVICE!

February 18th, 2011

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

With the deal about community service is that it should be optional. Why you may ask, it's simple. I thought that community service is supposed to be about caring for others. It shouldn't be about forcing kids to do it but it should be about it coming from the heart. When something comes from the heart it tends to mean more to others than forcing them to do it.

Ask anybody, there is more to wanting than forcing. Trust me I've learned the hard way. If you force them to do it they won't like it. But if you suggest it, they might like it!

One time I was at a girl scout meeting and we were deciding what to do for St. Patrick's Day. Our troop leader FORCED

us to do a charity party and to tell you the truth I hated it! But you know what, over time it got better! We ended up in doing 6 charity drives raising $7,872!!!

Then This year I proposed a St. Patrick's Day party at a local nursing home. Oddly EVERYONE liked the idea. So lately, all we have been doing is getting ready for it. I mean how often do the elderly get visitors!?!?!? I hope this party turns out to be fantastic!!! and with everyone in such a happy mood what can go wrong?

You see TEACHER_NAME, by force people hate. But by choosing, people tend to like!

That is all for now,
