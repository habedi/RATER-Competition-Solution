Dear Principal;

Community service is a great way to help out your town.

There are many things students can do as community service.

Students can help elementary school students who need help understanding a subject.

Trash liters the school yard and many other public places, making the town look awful.

Also, community service can teach children to be responsible.

I think all students should be required to perform community service.

Many children in elementary school need help to understand their math homework.

However, there are 30 students and only 1 teacher.

It would be very hard on the teacher if they taught the lesson then every student has questions or needs help.

Older students from middle school or even high school could volunteer to go into the class and help out the teacher.

Even if they only go once a week for an hour it would take a tremendous load of the teachers back.

Schools are a place where trash is easily found blowing around in the wind.

It liters the town, making everything look dirty.

However, it can easily be fixed.

When students are required to perform community service the easiest thing to do would be to pick up trash.

Picking up all that trash will more than likely convince the students to stop dropping their trash everywhere.

They will learn that it is better to throw it away the first time than to throw it on the ground to be picked up at some later point in time.

Students think community service is a waste of time and in no way can it benefit them.

However, they are wrong.

By performing community service not only will the students clean up the town, they will get an immense sense of accomplishment.

Plus, students can receive community service hours, which help them increase their chances of getting into college.

Many people feel that community service takes too much time away from what they want to do.

I feel that they can just do one hour a week and it will benefit tem greatly.

Community service is arguably the best way to help your town.

It not only benefits the town, it benefits the students, the children being helped, and the teachers.

The people who are currently performing community service find it a great way to pass time and make new friends.

They think helping the community is very important.

If you require every student at your school to perform at least one hour of community service a week, the results will be astonishing.

Sincerely,
