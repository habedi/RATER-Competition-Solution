Dear principle,

I believe that this is a good policy that you should consider putting into effect. I believe that it is a good policy because at lunch time students may remember that they left some sort of homework or assignment at home. True, you could just use the school phone for that but what if you don't know your parents cell phone number its just easier to have it programmed into your phone so when you need to call them all you have to do is scroll down your contact list and call them.

Also I believe that students should have phones in school because if they were to get sick in school the student could call his/her parent on their own phone so that they could have more privacy in case there are other students in the nurses office. And what if a child needed to be picked up from school and didn't have any means of contacting their parent/guardian to tell them to come over and pick them up.

I do agree though with not allowing students to use their phones in class because that is just one more distraction in class where they are supposed to be paying attention to what they are being taught. If someone is caught using a cell phone in class then their phone should be taken away and they should get some sort of punnishment.

Also what if there is some sort of an emergency where there is no one in the area that you could ask for help. But if they had their phone they cold call someone.

Lunch is the only time during the school day that students are allowed to be free from work so maybe they should also be excused from the no cell phone rule and its not like students don't use their phones in lunch and sometimes in class the students are still getting high grades so I don't exactly see the harm that cell phones are causing.

So now you can see why cell phones would be a good thing to let students have in school.
