Should these summer projects that students work on during their break be teacher-designed or student-designed? Students should be able to put their own ideas in this summer project and designed it the way they want it to be. These projects should help them make their brains become more active since they will be doing these projects over break. By doing this they won't have to "refresh" their brain on what they learned the past school year and will already know what to do when they come back to school after break because of this project.

All students should put their ideas into their own projects and don't have to worry about what the teacher may give them. This can make the students become more active in the world or even school, and actually let them do something over break. They should let the students decide what type of project they want to work on that is helpful for them to continue to learn during break. If the students decide what they want to work on, then they should decide if it's going to take them the whole break or a couple of weeks to finish it. For example, they could do something they love to do over break instead of a teacher throwing any type of project to give them. Some students may be busy during break so this gives them the opportunity to work at their own pace. Since they know what they are doing for their project it shouldn't be that hard for them to manage.

If the students designed the projects then it would let them be more engage on what they are learning and what's going on during their break. The school will have less students who are confused on what's going on and the teacher wouldn't have to keep explaining themselves more than once. Also, it can actually make the students want to do the project, because they are doing something they like instead of the teacher designing something boring. Sometimes the students forget about the project that the teachers designed to them because they don't want to do it or they just didn't understand the idea the teacher was giving them. Therefore, if the students designed it themselves then the school and teachers won't have to worry about who did or didn't do the project.

Some people may think that teachers should be able to designed these projects. They may even think that the kids are not mature enough to do it and it's a teachers job to design them things. I understand it is a teachers job to teach the students, but it wouldn't be fun if all the teacher do is use his or her's own ideas. Shouldn't the students have a right to do things they like with the teachers helping them on the side. If they work together with the students and be more active with them, then that's when the students behave more mature and actually want to do the work. No students likes a teacher who only just talks and only do things their way without the students input.

Students should be able to pick out what type of project they want to do and work it out step by step to complete it. If students do this on their own, then they could learn how to plan and manage things by themselves. They would be learning how to be more independent. This way it can help them later on in the future if they ever go to college and even for their future jobs. This could help the students be creative and have different types of creativity and ideas all around the school. Then, the school will have an idea on what interests their students and know more about them individually as a person.Â
