Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit deprite the dangers it presents. Not only will we learn more from this Earth-like planet, but we can also see what it once was, and what is has become.

Venus has been considered as Earth's "Twin," because Venus is the only planet that is the closest to Earth, not only in density, but size. Every spacecraft that has been sent to Venus, doesn't make it out, because the atmosphere of Venus is too strong of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid. The temperatures alone average over 800 degrees. Too much for any human to survive. By studying Venus, we have learned the weather consists of errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to any probes that are seeking land on the surface of Vennus. Another example of what has been found is Venus may have had a form of life, just like Earth, once consisting of large oceans and forms of life. The planet today still consists of a rocky sediment, featuring and consisting of valleys, mountains, and craters. By working with what we know, NASA has been creating prototypes that could soon once carry humans to study Venus, at a long distance to keep it safe. Studying from our first resources, we have learned the safer distance humans can be at to observe Venus. It may not be an easy task, but it is survivable for humans.

From gathering information from space probes that have attempted to explore Venus, we can make prototypes to test around the atmosphere, before we send any humans to observe Venus from a distance. We have learned how to make observations from this Earth-like planet possible, and we have an insight of what this planet once was, and what it has become today. The exploration of Venus may hold a few dangers and set-backs, but researchers are doing the best they can to create a safe way to observe Venus from a distance.
