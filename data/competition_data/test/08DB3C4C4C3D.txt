Driverless cars would be a great thing for the future but there are also negatives to it. It would also be a lot of money spent to make this invention possible. If you think about it cars are pretty much driverless in a way because some cars can parallel park on their own, and evenstop themselves when it senses an oncoming vehicle that is to close.

The negative effect that this would have on the world is that these cars could possibly malfunction and lead to a wreck. It would let a drivers guard down to a very low level and they wouldn't be focused on the road as much as they would if they were the ones actually driving. This could also take away the law that drivers have to have a liscense in order to drive because some will think "who needs a liscense to drive a driverless vehicle"?. That issue alone could lead to many problems. I believe that vehicles are only safe when a human is controlling it.

The positive effect that driverless cars could have on the world is that it could create many jobs for people. It could help people get places that they aren't familiar with.

My opinion on this is that vehicles should only be driven by a human that is liscensed to operate a vehicle. I don't think people will be safe if driverless cars became a thing because the creators wouldn't be 100% sure that these vehicles are safe to be on the road. Lives could possibly be at risk.
