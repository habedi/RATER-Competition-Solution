In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author is trying to explain how the planet Venus is an intresting mission that is dangerous to human life, after many attempted unsucccesful missions NASA is still finding ways to land a spacecraft safely on this planet so information can be collected. Scientist in NASA are very intrested in the planet. It is considered to be "Earth's twin".

Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky. Made of up 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds of highly sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, not to mention average tempratures of 800 degrees fahrenheit. Many question NASA about making trips to this planet due the highly unsuitable conditions for humans. In the excerpt it states. "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth, such an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans." It shows how harmful to life Venus can be.

People wonder why Scientist are trying to further investigate the Venus's surface if the planet is so inhospitable. Turns out people from NASA and Astronomers are very fascinated by the planet. Researchers say it may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. " Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could've supported various forms of life, just like earth." It is very obvious why researchers want to further investigate. This is very important and could impact all of life on earth. Also NASA are in the process of trying to build protective spacecrafts hospitable to Venus." It will not be easy conditions, but it is survivable for humans." stated in the article.

In conclusion, NASA researchers should furthermore investigate into this planet, we never know, it could change our life. Traveling should not be limited by something that can be dealt with if possible. As people in this society we are trying to meet the edges of new inventions, discoveries, and innovation. To make it to that point risk have to be taken.
