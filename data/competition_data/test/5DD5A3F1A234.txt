Dear Principal

I believe that students should be required to do community service. The community service could help people to make better choices as a human being. The kids that do nothing all day could use the exercise to get out and do something for the community. I believe our school could use these actions to improve a productive citizen. Some community service actions such as picking up litter, going to the animal shelter to help care for animals that have been neglected, would be ideal for the schools community. It could help students become better people if they know what community service is about. If a student does not like community service, he or she may follow the rules or laws so they will not have to perform these actions. Community service would be the best thing for the school and for the state, with crime and teenage actions among the community.
