I think that the all of the students at this school should do community service because its good for the student in many ways. It can help build character, create new friends, make the community a safer place to live and help the future of the student and other students to come, but i strongly think that it should be up to the student. I Think this way because the last thing we want is for the community service to be a burden upon the student. Community service can interfere with grades, health in some cases, and it can bring a lot of fatigue to the students at this school. Some students family may not have a lot of money and the student needs to help out more at home than in any other place. I believe that community service should be up to the student, so you should NOT make it required on all of the students but make it an option at the school or maybe even an elective teaching students about how they can help their community.
