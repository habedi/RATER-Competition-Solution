If you want to help take care of animals whose countries were destroyed during World War II then come be apart of the program

Come be apart of the seagoing Cowboys program. You can take care of horses and other animals that need help while others are fighting overseas. And we will travel around the world! You will be feeding the animals giving them hay, oats, and water. You will also have to make the stalls are cleaned and not dirty. The will need to check on them every now and then to make sure they are ok. And then we try to find a place for the animals to be housed and taking care of. And you will be grateful that you did this. You will get to visit other countries and lands that were destroyed by world war and help all these animals.

That is why you should join the seagoing Cowboys program!

Thank you for reading.
