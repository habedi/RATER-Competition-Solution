Dear Senator,

I feel that we should change using the Electoral college. The popular vote is much more effective. Using the popular vote to decide who becomes president would show who the citizens of the united states want. The popular vote shows what each state has voted for, using the Electoral college takes the right away for the people being able to vote for the president that they favor. Instead of using what the people voted for they come together to chose the candidate they predict would be the best and do the most for the country and that's not fair. If voting is important to this country then congress should understand that when the poeple vote for something everyone wants it to be their decisions that makes one of the two canidates become president not who the Electoral college believes would be best. If we could overcome the debate between what process works better more people might vote.

Although some citizens believe that the Electoral college is a good idea. I feel that if they compared not having the electoral college and only using the popular vote durning voting periods they would feel they system is more effisent. One example is big states could make a tremdous impact on which canidate wins the electon. These states have more people with more opinions that should be used durning the time of the electon for the president.

Some of the problems with the Electoral college is not only do voters not vote for their president, Back in 1960 " The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Deomcratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)". "In that same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please" That is not what we are promised as a country. It states that the electoral college is suppose to cast a vote on what their state wants and what their state has chosen. That year the right to do so was taken away. Voting is a serious matter. Popular vote would clearifiy what each states popular favor is, who they want, and which candidate their vote was to be casted for.

I hope with all the information that I have just provided you with above will help to show you that the popular vote isn't only what most people want it's also the better choice.        Â
