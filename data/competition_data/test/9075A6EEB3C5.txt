Dear TEACHER_NAME, have you ever thought about telling your students that they will have to do community service? Well, I have thought about that question and I personally think that it is a great idea for students to help out the community. Look on the bright side even though students my not think that is a good idea they know its good to help out at least a couple of minites. Some students would have to help clean up areas where there is litter on the floor, and some people would be doing some thing different than that.

Let me explain further, there is a lot of reasons why animals have been dyeing over the past few years. One of the main reasons why they have been dyeing is because when people though litter on the ground or on the ocean they don't relies that they are destroying animals habitat. For example when people visit the beach and they eat they fell to tired to get up and through away their trash then they just put their trash in the ocean on the beach, But the bad thing about that is fish might mistake the trash for food and that could cause them to die.

Most importantly, not only can students help out by picking up the trash that the see on the ground but they can help out little kids. For example if the little kids needs help on their homework you can help them out on there homework. Even though most children don't ask for help when you see that they need help don't just sit there and not help them out students should help them anyways.

Even though kids like to spend time doing other stuff like play video games or listen to music or other stuff like that
