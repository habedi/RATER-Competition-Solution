Imagine you are about to head into summer break and your teacher assigns a summer project that you aren't interested in. Some students believe they should be able to design their own project. Although some say teachers should be responsible for designing summer projects. Actually students should be able to design summer projects to fit what they do during summer.

Those who believe teachers should design summer projects have their reasons. They believe teachers should design summer projects because it will keep students occupied over the summer. Teachers would be able to control what their students do and hopefully keep their minds fresh for the following year. Teachers dont think students should be able to control what their project is on becuase it could lead them off track or students wouldnt take it serious.

actually, students should be able to design their own summer projects because they would be able to base it off their summer vacation. Students would be more ingaged in what they are doing because they would be able to do what they are interested in but still be learning new material or review on what they had learned in the past year. This would keep students thinking about their project and make it fun for them to do.

another reason is students would be able to base their peoject on what they do for the summer. For example if a student was going to the cayman islands they could make their project fit in to what he or she does. This would stop students from stressing and pushing away from doing the project. The project wouldnt entirely be made up by the students. There would still be limitations like the material you would choose to do your project on so students will still have to put in effort. This helps Students have fun on vacation while getting a head start for the next year.

In conclusion students should be able to design their own projects so they would still be able to enjoy their vacation without stressing over school. Students would be able to show creativity and positive learning skills for the upcoming year. I think all summer projects should be student designed to encourage students to learn be creative and happy with what they are doing.
