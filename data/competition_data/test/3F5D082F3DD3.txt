I would think the student would i like too keep it at a c average cause at the moment . they might not be getting the subject all that good so they would need more time . they could be trying there hardest but still wont get it and if they . still is doing bad in the subject that could be al they could get .

the principal gone take away what they like when they in class the could be thinking about what they wont too be doing messing with the grenades more then ever and i don think that would be the right thing to do to the to the student.

i would think i know what they wont more cause i am student my self and i kind think that's the right thing to do for them .

another reason is because i am a student too and i would know what they wont more then the principal would know plus at this moment in time that would be the wrong thing to do i kind of think the principal should ask the student is that what .

they wont or not i think she or he should just make the change moms and dads could be still think the same thing too this is the way i am gone to support my reason i think they should get a c average.
