Do you think the world would be a better place if we had driverless cars? I dont think it would, it would cause more problems. Driverless cars can cause many problems if an accident were to happen, you still have to keep your eyes on the road, and there would be new laws to the road.

First off I am against the driverless cars because the first company to make one would get suid many times. If an accident were to occur while the car is in auto pilot the company is the first to blame. Anything can happen such as the car not working properly for being in a bad conditon or someone else on the road could hit you and the car cant react or expects you too in such little time. In the story it says " If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer." Exactly this means the company is automatically at fault.

Also no one wants a car that can drive on it own only at certain times. If i am driving a car i would like to not have to worry about anything ever. I should be able to trust my car to take me to my destination. From the story it says "This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." NO one wants to wait their turn to drive it defeats the entire purpose of the idea of a driverless car.

we have many laws that requires the human to be in control at all times. If someone has a driverless car and doesnt have his hand on the wheel then why shouldnt someone else do the same. In paragraph 9 it says "Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the ony safe car has a human driver in control at all times." So basically you are breaking a law.

I am against driverless cars because they are not street legal and can cause many problems. If one was to break the law he can easily blame it on his driverless car and that isnt fair to any other human without one. Driverless cars can cause many problems if an accident were to happen, you still have to keep your eyes on the road, and there would be new laws to the road.
