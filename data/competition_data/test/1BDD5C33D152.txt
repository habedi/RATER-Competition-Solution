I don't belive it is manditory for all students to do an extracurricular activity. I belive it should be the students choice on if is necessary to participate in an activity. The activities you are asking the student to participate in might not be something to enjoy or somrthing they want to do. Also some students may not have the time to do the activity at hand.

Also if the activity is something physical , the student might have a condition that causes them not to be able to do the activity.

Time is every thing it is something we depend on all the time in our daily lives. Students need time to do the things they have planned as well. Others may have other activites outside of the school activities requested. Some students may want to study rather than do an activity that they know they might not have time for. Some students may have bad grades and want to bring them up and needs that time to do his or her work to bring their grade up. If the time of the activity doesn't fit within the time on which the student is free how will they be able to do the activity?

The second reason why i don't belive it is important to participate in an activity is because, the student might not any of the activities listed that they would be interested in. Student might want to do this activity simply because of the way the student thinks of the activity. A lot of people are not interseted in doing another acivity because of the are already in or just don't want to do. This also raps around the fact that the student may not have the time to do so and that he or she has enough work or extra things to do regarding themselves. It's the students opinion on what they want to do.

I belive the students should decide on whether or not it's a good choice to have this in place. If the students vote and make a decision they can make a reasonable conclusion that helps every student affected by it. After hearing what the students recomend to the principal, then the principal might not carry on with his decison if it's helpfull or not. Students need their opinions to be heard as well.!

The main thing is the students. How do they feel about what the principal wants to put in place. In my opinion it shouldn't be a requirment to participate in an extracurricular activity. The students are the ones effected not the pricipal ! It should be up to the student not the principal.
