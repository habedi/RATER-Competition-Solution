Facial Action Coding System is a potential and valuable way to read students' emotions while in class. Through the use of this technology, it could bring forth various opportunites. The system could open doors to the genuine thoughts of students to let adults better understand a view into their minds . Utilizing this technology will illustrate a positive change to the school by giving instructors insight to a students mental health, engagment with certain topics, and learning style.

The mental health of a student is a vital piece of information that a teacher should know. In the text, the author states that, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that too" (Alto 6). By writing this, he conveys to readers that the software can process your emotions. Therefore, if a student demonstrates a pattern of unhappy emotion, an administrator can then speak to the student and find out what might be going on in their home life or if they need to see a counselor. If a computer could give insight to happy or sad emotions, what other emotions could it detect?

The knowledge of how a student learns or the level of engagment they have within the classroom is a key component to modifying lessons and ensuring the most enriching education for a certain individual. Within the article, Alto inserts a quote from Thomas Huang, a professor, in which he says, "A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored" (Alto 6). This means that opportuinities for a student to get a more indivualized education increase, and teachers will have the ability to revise lessons in order to adjust to level of understanding majority of students have. It would also create a tremendous chance for the students who are falling below average to be identified and recieve the propering tutoring needed. Would these new adjustments then lead to a better understanding of learning styles?

Each individual in a classroom has a unique way of learning that requires attention and adaption on the lesson in order to fully let the student reach their potential to excell with their education. The author claims that the technology could, "...modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" (Alto 6). This gives the information that the system could be able to analyze the way students learn, and give access to various learning styles of their student. This would enable them to then adhere to the students education needs, and therefore open doors to make break throughs with children that had been struggling.

There are many factors to consider when contemplating the use of this technology in the classroom. Although, the overall result of putting this system in place would be positive. The ability to detect students emotions will enable instructors to teach more attentively to each indivdual student, causing the childs achievement level to rise snd their education to strengthen. Enriching education and making it personal to the student will in time increase passing test scores, the number of college graduates, and literacy rate. Schools should consider encorperating the FACS technology in order to obtain a brighter, better future for their kids and country.
