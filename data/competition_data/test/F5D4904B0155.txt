Many people have experiences that they remember in life. That could be from the first date to a trip to the Bahamas. But little do they cherish their time in school. Schools have gone from being a class taught by a teacher to being at the fingertips on a digital device, but do these devices benefit or hurt the growing generation. Schools have been successful at giving opportunities for all students like collaborative work, hands-on experiences, and the ability to have one-on-one communication between a teacher and the student.

One reason why classroom setting education is beneficial is because of the collaboration among friends. Students tend to enjoy their education much better when they have friends to share it with. The classroom is an environment where students can work on activities together and share their knowledge. It is also good for students to take breaks every once in a while and to communicate with their friends so that they can refresh and get back to learning. Collaboration is something that is generally not found in online classes and causes the student to lose interest in the class. When students have the opportunity of working with peers, it increases their interest and productivity as a result of having a classroom education.

Another benefit to the classrooms is the hands-on experience it includes. Students show more interest in classes that provide selections of activities that go with the topic that is being taught. Schools provide enjoyable experiences that lead to better student development. Students do not enjoy the aspect of repetitive and tiring labor while studying for online courses. Hands-on and entertaining activities add to the excitement of learning in classes.

The final reason that working in classrooms is beneficial is that students can work with their teachers. With online classes, there is a lack in there being people that can help educate an individual person. Classes allow teachers to learn about their students, figure out their weaknesses, and help each one individually. With online courses, students do not often have answers to their questions that they need; sure, maybe they can search the Web, but they do not have somebody that can interpret information so that it can be remembered. In order for students to have improved success, students need one-on-one help from their teachers.

Even though it may be true that online classes can provide more time to study and to learn, classrooms in schools provide a better learning environment over the alternative online classes. Opportunities from schools like collaborative work, classroom activities, and help from teachers provide a better learning environment that bring better success out of students. Online classes may not be providing the correct balance of interest and help that drive success in students. Keeping classrooms like they have been will progress the growing generations to be as successful as past generations because of the great public education that is has been in place.
