I believe that driverless cars should be developed. It may be true that some of the people and states go against driverless cars. But, people are making driverless cars improve everyday. With every new type of development there are going to be positives and negatives. The positives of the driverless car is that it can drive by it self. Also the driverless cars alerts the individual thats driving the car if he or she is in danger. The negatives about driverless cars is that it has lots of improvements to be made. For example,if the alert system didnt work while you was 15 seconds from a accident and the car was driving you in someone got hurt who would the police blame you or the manufacture. But, even with these error I still think driverless cars would be very helpfull. Some of the ways a driverless car could be helpful to a individual driver is on roadtrips. The reason why I said this is because road trips are very long. So even if you fall asleep while driving the car the car is doing ninety percent of the driving. So you should still be safe because the car is driving on its own. The only problem is that you have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. But most people who fall asleep while driving always keep there hands on the wheel. So I dont think people keeping there hands on the wheel will be a problem. In conclusion I believe in the development of driverless cars because once the cars are fully developed I believe these cars will bring more positives than negatives. This is why I believe in the development of driverless cars.
