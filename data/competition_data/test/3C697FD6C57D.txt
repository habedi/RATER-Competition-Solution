Dear Principal,

I write you to make a request to not make community service a requirement because not everyone will be comfortable doing so. You should make it a choice to be able to do community service. You should also give whom ever does participate gets extra credit, as a reward for doing so.

Community service may seem fun for some people, but for others it may be boring or a waist of time. One of the reasons for that maybe that they don't have time or that they have other things that need to be done, like babysitting or something of that sort.

Now if you want to a lot of people to do community service without being forced, then do something that they would like to do other than picking up trash for an example. Pick something like taking them to the A.S.P.C.A and let them work with the animals that they like. Take them to the senior citizen home and let them entertainment or be an audience for them.

If you really want people to come offer an award of some sort that you know everyone wants and needs. That is all we ask of you.

sincerely, student
