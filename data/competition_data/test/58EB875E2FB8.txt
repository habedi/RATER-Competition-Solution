Do you thinks it is possible to tell a persons emotion with the use of technology? I do think it is possible to tell someones emotions with technology. You can also read it sometimes without technology. Scientists scan old painting from years ago named the Mona Lisa.

They said that they used technology to scan it and they got the emotions that it was having. The scientists said that the mona lisa was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. There are two more emotions which are suprise and sadness. Those are the six basic emotion scientists have calculated.

They should be able to read the emotions of students in a classroom. What if the students is sad and having a bad day you dont have to be mean to the student. This technology may also help in a health class. It can show if depressed or the bones of a student in his face region.

I think that it is possible to read someones emotions with the use of technology. They were able to read alot of emotions and tell alot of things. They should continue doing it and improve it.
