Driverless cars do sound fun and all but is that what you really want? I dont think having these types of cars is safe because there could be a glitch in the cars system. There are many reasons as to why i dont believe having a driverless car is safe.

In the passage, paragraph four states that there would be a spinning sensor sending laser beams of a 3-D model, showing the surroundings of the car. I dont think that the spinning sensor would work due to glitching. At one time or another, evrything glitches. If the car was sent on the mode to drive by itself, it could glitch and everything would turn into a big mess. Sometimes technology doesnt work all the time. Another reason as to why i dont believe the driverless cars would work is because it would make unexperianced drivers thinks its okay to drive since they have the assistance. Also while the computer is driving the car, the person might get on their phone. When many people get on their phones, they tend to engage into the subject theyre viewing; that means tuning everyone out. So if and when the car signals for the driver to take over, they could be distracted and wreck the car, causing danger for everyone around them.

All in all, i do not believe having driverless cars is beneficial. it can cause distraction, glitch, or quit working. These are saftey hazards and shouldnt be further produced.
