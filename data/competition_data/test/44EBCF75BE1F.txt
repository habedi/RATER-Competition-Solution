Homeschooling is the first thing I think about when I hear the phrase,"distance learning". Now knowing that it is an option of public school, I think it would be beneficial for many, to be able to attend classes from home, but only for certain circumstances and situations.

In my own personal experience of having been in public school going on 11 years now, I really have enjoyed myself. There have been so many things I've learned just from going to school and being around other people all the time. For example, how to get along and work with others, Problem solving skills, how to navigate friendships, and compromising strategies, which I think are really important things for people to learn as they grow up Being able to interact with others is a very important skill that is essential to having success in the workplace. Most of the things you know can only be witnessed or learned from being in a school environment. So learning and taking course at home may not be beneficial all the time.

However, for some this may be a better option. Being in a familiar environment will make students feel more comfortable and get work done more efficiently, with greater accuracy, and have better comprehension of the material they receive. Also some people may have disabilities or other complications that may cause them to be absent from school, which will deprive them of the education they rightfully deserve and being able to excel in a classroom work environment. Furthermore, some people may not have the best school experience with dealing with bullies and other things of that sort and will benefit from the online schooling. It will can solve the issue of students being behind or set back in the curriculum for missing a day So with the online schooling, they can just watch or listen to what they missed and complete it at home and don't have to worry about their grade going down from missing work.

I already know that me personally, would not excel with those predicaments. Mostly because I deal with a slight case of procrastination anyways, so being at home and not having as many requirements and restrictions, I may forget to do my work, get distracted, hold it off for too long, or just not do it at all. I feel like being at school and getting held accountable by someone in authority, the teacher or instructor, would cause me to achieve more academic success from finishing my work. I also enjoy the social part of school too. Being able to have friends and be social is something I would really miss about having online schooling.

In conclusion, Society and the communities within them are becoming better and more inclusive concerning education, regarding to so many different alternatives to public school, college/university, and other degree or certificate earning programs. Online schooling sound like a really nice idea and is one solution to solve many problems within the public school circuit, but It would be even better if it were an optional way to learn so it can be more inclusive for other's situations.
