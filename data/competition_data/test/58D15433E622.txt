A plan created called smart planning involves the reduce or car usage helping the world also reduce bad pollution, and traffic jams. This way more transportation will be provided for other cases or people in need of that. In Germany, Paris, Bogota and the United States there are many reasons being caused to reducing cars due to jepordise it can cause such as pollution, traffic jams, space and transportation. In all these countries there are the different reasons to why cars should be banned.

To begin with, in Germany a district in Freiburg near the French ans Swiss borders cars have been givin up by people. Pepole are claiming to be more happy with their newly lifestyle of not using a car. Before they were using a car they also claimed that everything had felt more tense. Now that cars are banned in the district there has been more free space for pedestrians to walk. There has been more availabale roads and stress that are not packed anymore. There is space to build. Before cars had taken control over the roads and stress not proving areas and space to walk in. Middle class were choking cities meaning that their Cars were just taking way too much space. Cars are responsible for the greenhouse. Knowing that passanger cars are also reposible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas. protection agencies are promoting car reduce as well as communities that are less dependent on cars. Vauban's streets are car free. 70 percent of vaubans families are also car free. The driveways, street parking and garages are all fobidden in that district.

However, Paris has faced another jepordising problem due to smog. Paris has been known to have the most smog than the rest of the European capitals. Due to this problem cars have been banned in order to clear the air pollution causing danger. This bad pollution can lead to sickness, weather changes that are bad and may cause people to inhale bad oxygen. People were commanded to leave their license plates at home or risk to pay a 22 euro fine that equals to 31$ dollars in American money. So far 4,000 people have paid this fine for not following this law. With this progress the pollution has cleared from Paris and has now gone to another place.

Innitially, traffic jams are a common problem in our everyday life. In Bogota, they face traffic jams and pollution. For this cause the citizens of Bogota have banned the usage of cars only allowing busses and taxis to be used. They have placed transportation instead of cars. People whp violate these rules are permitted to to pay a 25$ dollar fine. The reduce of cars in Bogota has helped clear the roads and make a dramastic change that has to do with the traffic jams they had been facing. Since there has been so much rain every single day in Bogota the air pollution has been reduced. People who visited Bogota had been mesmerized to the changes there has been of less pollution and traffic jams. Seeing the country all coaporate in this change.

Therefor, in the United states there has been a change of people reducing the use of cars. There has been a reduce in miles driven due to people who cant afford getting a car or paying for one. Childrens have not bothered to get a license because they had started to use bycicles, walking and transportation to get to their destination. There has been a major drop of 16 to 39 years old that didn't bother getting their license. Creating car pools is one of the greates way to reduce car usage. Communication also plays a role in this change. Having cell phones and communicating more with freinds would not always require driving. Although transportation also has its cons to car industry. A buisness plan has been made in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable.

In conclusion, countries have faced big problems due to all these causes of car usage. People had given up their cars and are now using transportaion, walking and Bycicles has helped get rid of all these problems countries were facing.
