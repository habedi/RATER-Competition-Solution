Vehicles and Phones

In 2018 there were 4,637 deaths caused by distracted drivers. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle, it increases the risk of accidents, causes deaths, and overall the act is irresponsible.

Well, Iets say you're going out of town and you need to use the gps? Most cars nowadays use modern technology, and there's a thing called Bluetooth. Having the option of Bluetooth in a vehicle allows a phone to connect to a car wirelessly. Which would ultimately allow distraction-free gps. Cell phones are helpful, but can be highly unsafe, while operating a vehicle.

Is Bluetooth actually any safer? Setting up Bluetooth can be as easy as one, two, three. Look for your cars manual and it should have directions on how to set up bluetooth from your phone to your car. I believe bluetooth is safer because you would be allowed to have hands free control over your phone. This essentially removes the problem of operating your phone while driving. You will only have to set up bluetooth once, so once your phone is paired there is no undoing it unless you please.

In conclusion, I don't think people should be allowed to use cell phones in their vehicle to any extent if it's unavoidable. People who do so not only are putting themselves at risk but other people's lives as well. Bluetooth is a great alternative to minimize the use of cell phones while operating vehicles. Most cars nowadays have this option. For people who don't have this option, i advise that you not only think about yourself, but as well as other people, when using your cell phone while driving.
