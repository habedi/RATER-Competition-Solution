I personally think its a good idea because students can become friends and be more social. i also think students should not be forced to join a sport or a club. im in between it being a good or bad idea and a lot of people like sports and clubs. im going to dissagree because students should choose what they wanna do whether its join a club or even play a sport. most of the time students dont wanna join either because they dont have time or they just arent into it. I know more people probably like sports a little bit more than clubs only because they actually like what there playing or there doing it to be popular. you also have games to worry about and i know that the players are nervous before the games. clubs are just something to do if your bored and wanna join something and there for fun and theres nothing to worry about. a few people i know are already popular or have popular friends and they do sports to probably stay popular. sports help you for the real world like a tennis player or a nba basketball player.
