There are many advantages to driving a car but there are even more reasons to limiting usage on cars as there are to driving one.

Most people today drive thier cars to get from one location to another, but most do not think about what it actually does to the environment. Most cars run on a form of Diesel fuel which release carbon emissions and other greenhouse gasses which are harmful towards the environment. Passenger cars in Europe are responsible for around 12% of the greenhouse gasses there. And in most car intensive areas in the United States up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions is released. For a day in France car usage was banned to reduce the amount of smog in the area. After 5 days of intensifying smog the amount of car traffic was reduced by 60%. another great reason for reducing the usage of cars is that it causes less stress towards people and yourself. And it greatly reduces traffic for other cars. in Bogota, once a year they have a day without cars which is part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. Since then it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, sports centers, and multiple parks. Some people prefer biking than driving which i salso a good way to get fit. Since there are so many bikers there most of the uneven sidewalks have been replaced by larger and smoother sidewalks.

In the end, there are many reasons to limit the usage of cars but people should consider it more for what it does for the world.
