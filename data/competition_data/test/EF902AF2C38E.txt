The Facial Action Coding System could be useful for panting and people as well. If you look at at painting at someone you really cant tell if they are happy or sad. If you use the Facial Action Coding System it could tell you how they are feeling in the painting and if they are happy or not. You can easliy tell if a person right infront of you is not happy but sometimes you cant. You can use the Facial System on them and it can tell you how they are feeling. Computers can also help out a lot on what you dont understand.

For instance in the Mona Lisa painting you cant tell her emotion in her picture. If you use technology it can help you out and tell you if she is happy or sad. It gives you a percentage like shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. It can give you an estimation on how she is feeling in the picture. The computer has an 3-D computer model so it has all of the face major muscles so it can tell your emotion on your face. It can show your surprised if your eyebrows are raised up or if your angry yuour lips would be tightened to show anger. You can also write down different emotions that you do in the mirror and see if someone can reconize what emotion you have. It can tell if you force a smile and if it wasn't a real one. Technology is creating better ways to communicate with humans and developing different things for humans to interact with.

I believe that it would be very different and amazing if they use this on people ands paintings0. It could tell poeple a lot of things they are wondering about people in the world or even paintings that they see. It shows us that technology has plenty of ways to interact with us and give us new things to experince and learn about.
