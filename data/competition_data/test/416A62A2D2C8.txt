Students would benefit from being able to attend classes online. When a student is sick, or simply can not attend class, they can just go online and be present digitally. Sometimes, kids are not comfortable with attending school. They can just stay home and get the same material as someone who would go to school. In today's world we should take advantage of the technology we have, and use it to give everyone the opportunity to learn.

Once, in the 7th grade, I obtained this horrible sickness that lead me to be absent for two whole weeks. When I got back, I was so behind in my class work. This lead to my grades slipping, and having to get tutors to just pass my classes. The simple solution to this problem is attending classes while I was home on my computer. I could of video conference in all of my classes to maintain where I needed to be for that year. also, I could of further analyzed the class by going to the school website and seeing what my teacher had uploaded for studying.

My brother, Generic_Name, was bullied harshly in middle school. People would make fun of him because he was overweight and had red hair. Some days, he would come home crying, because of how cruel everyone was to him. This could of lead to permanent psychological damage to my brother, luckily he recovered. The simply way of avoiding this problem was attending an online school. He could of avoided his bullies by doing this. When the first incident occurred he could of just finished that school year online, away from his troubles.

on the other hand, you need to present in the classroom to get the full learning experience. You can't just simply not attend school and expect to learn everything online. You need a teacher to further explain the subject you are being taught, and for them to answer any questions that the students has to ask. For my brother's problem, he needed to face his bullies and stand up for himself. You can't just hide away from your problems in life. problems you face in school is good life lessons that you will learn from.

In all, online schooling is great opportunity for students to have in school systems. It helps with sick days, tragic experiences and catching up on work. Plus, being able to work online can allow you to go at your pace, so you don't feel rushed. This distance learning may have some tweaks that needs to be fixed, but students do benefit from attending classes from home.
