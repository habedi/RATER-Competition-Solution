Extracurricular activities is a good way to relive stress, its good for mental/physical health, We can have fun and it gets our mind off of school work but if we arent interested in the choices we have we will not be motivated and we wont even bother to have fun. Its better to do something you're passionate about..

We cant pick if we want to participate in an activity or not and a lot of students arent interested in any of the activities there are. And of we are forced to do something we dont have passion to we wont try hard and most importantly have fun and enjoy ourselves. Everyone is different, has different opinions than everyone and dont have the same taste in activities. And thats why the we should have what they like as an activity. But of course there are many students and its impossible but knowing what we like really helps students participate.

Since a lot of people dont want to participate, doing a survey can help the school know what we all like, making activities can help with making more students want to join. This way everyone can do what they like, have fun and relax. But of course things like this can happen for example; A students doesnt want to do any activities, the student shouldnt be forced to do it, she should have the choice not to and for the students who dont want to participate, They can do homework, school work they need to get done and relax. Forcing them isnt going to change anything but make them not want to do it even more. So with this plan everyone is happy and doing what they like best.
