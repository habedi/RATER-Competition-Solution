Why do you think that author think we should studying Venus, and is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in presents? I think we should study Venus before trying to visit or exploring ,because you never know whats going on up there. Venus is like the first or second biggest planet on earth. To me i think Venus is a cool planet to study and learn about. In the passage I read that venus has the hottest surface temperature. In paragraph 3 it says on the planet's surface the surface tempertures average is over 800 degress. If i had a choice to go to Venus i wouldn't go, because i feel like its not save to go there because anything can haappen. Some people that do go up there 50% of them either cant breathe, get hurt ,or other things happened. Venus has about 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets . In paragraph 4 it states that the value of returnig back to venus seems indisputable, but what are the options of making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive. So therefore I agree with the author. I think you should study before trying out new things and exploring venus.
