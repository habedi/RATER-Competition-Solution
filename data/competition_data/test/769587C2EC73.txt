Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program was one of my best choices of my life. Being a Seagoing Cowboy has times where you needed to be serious and take your work seriously, but it also has times where you could have a lot of fun. There were many things that you can do when you become a Seagoing Cowboy. You could help take care of animals, serve as a night watchman, etc. There were many things you could have done if you dont like one of the jobs, there is so many new things to experience!

After working, the guys and I would play baseball and volleyball games. A good way to just relaxand take it easy after working hard. Others even sometimes had table-tenis tournaments, fencing, reading, games, whittling, and even boxing! The activities were fun and helped pass time. The games were just a way to let loose for a while. Anyone is bound to have fun!

I also learned a few things in my time of being a Seagoing Cowboy. For instance, being a Seagoing Cowboy helped me become more aware of the people in other countries and their needs. Many people out there are struggling to do things for themselves, and their country. So help out! Whenever you get an opertunity to help someone you should take it. It's a great way to help out. Think about what it could do for you, and other people! Don't let this amazing opertunity slip through your fingers. Become a Seagoing Cowboy today! I promise, you won't regret it.
