To the principal:

The gossip is going around, many of students are talking, quite like busy working bee's in a hive. It's everything all the students are talking about. Its the new policy you want. You're considering about changing our school policy towards our athletic department. Many students at our school have a C average. I personally do not agree that to participate in sports students most have a B average. I disagree with you're policy for three reasons. First, a C is an average grade. Second, sometimes the students grade is beyond their control. Last but not least, sports are supposed to be fun.

According to the NEG, National Education Group , a C is an average grade. When a student is at a C they have room for improvement. Nonetheless, they aren't failing either. However a C is still a passing grade. I see why you think students should be above average to be able to participate in sports. On the other hand, you would be depriving more than half of your schools population, who are still passing their class, from participating in sports.

In most occasions, students grades are lower because they don't know or comprehend the material. That could be for several reasons; either the student wasn't paying attention during class, he/she is incapable of learning the material, or the teacher doesn't teach very well. From past experiences, my grades have been lower than my usual standards due to my teacher.

Sometimes, its the teacher who doesn't teach, but rather tries to have the students teach themselves. Also, many students may have diseases such as dyslexia or ADD and they just don't know it. Therefore, those students may be incapable of learning the way the rest if the class does.

For my last reason, sports are a pass time. There supposed to be fun, to pass the time. Athletics should be nothing to have to stress over. I'd rather not do any sports, than stress over having an average grade to be able to participate. Seventy eight percent of students have a C average, a student that falls into that percentage might be the next "Lebron James"

But with the new policy, you may never know.

Many students are worried that they wont be able to partake in the athletic department at our school. If your policy follows through, many students will be excluded from playing sports. I highly disagree with your policy. First of all, a C is an average grade, the student is not failing with a C. Also, on some occasions it is beyond the students control. Finally, Sports aren't supposed to be a critical situation , they're supposed to be fun. Taking away sports from kids is like taking the oval office from the president- they'll be left with nothing to do, and nowhere to go.
