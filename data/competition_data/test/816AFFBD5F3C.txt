Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College has been an election process in the united states sense the constitution was created. But it has come to the time where it no longer has a valuble position and is beginning to deteriorate. Over 60% of voters would prefer to only have a popular vote for Presidential elections, rather than the Electoral College. Recently it seems as if every election has been very tight and the winner of the popular votes loses due to the turn out of the Elecoral College votes. The Ellectoral College system should be abolished and banned from our election process.

In the Electoral College voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President rather than them directly voting themselves. Source 2 States "The Electors can be anyone not holding office." Therefore anybody can put theirself in the position to be in the Ellectoral College, even if they are unqualified for the responsibilities it requires. Also voters can't always control who their electors vote for so the efficiency of the election has already decreased.

This system allows for disaster. The electors could always defy the will of the people. Source 2 brings up "Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic elecors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy." "Faithless" electors in the past have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they would like, and there is no guarentee that this will not occur again.

When it comes down to the core, the Electoral College does not provide an equal election to all voters. You will not find candidates dedicating their time in states where they believe they do not have a chance of winning. In effect, the representation and campaigning is not equally distributed throughout all the states. Some states may get no campaigning at all. Source 2 includes "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen staes didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad." All the focus is centered into the tight races of the "swing" states.

It is said that rarely will the electoral college voting come out as a tie but it has happend. In the situation of a tie the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, and the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

The Electoral College is out dated and irrelevant to our modern society and it is too indirect to present the true votes from our country. It is time to leave the vote to the people and only the people, and it is time for our country to mature and abolish the Ellectoral College.       Â
