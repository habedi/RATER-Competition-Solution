I believe that driverless cars are a bad idea. There are issues that can be seen to cause problems. The idea of a computer doing something for you takes out the factor of doing it yourself.

If a computer beggins to start to do the work for us when wont have any work to to do which, sounds beautiful but, in reality can become a disaster. If we let a computer do something for us like drive, then we can end up never learning things like driving which is a huge part in the dalay teens life. I am a teen and I believe that if I were to be given a car that drives itself i would never use it for the simple fact i dont get to use what ive learned in drivers ed to use.

I could go on with many issues with this idea. Like, if a computer were to mess up and wreak the car who would to be at blame? Would it be the driver or the manufacturer? These are some issues that could efect people.

I just believe that cars that drive themselves are would become a bigger issue then what people think. Other people can think their oppion on the subject. But, that is just my personal oppion.
