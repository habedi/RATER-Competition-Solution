Phones and Driving

Today, the majority of people own and operate their phones while driving their vehicles which will always be a no go. That's very dangerous and now it is illegal to do so, if you are caught texting and driving or even talking on the phone while you are driving you will get pulled over and maybe sent to jail.

I feel like the only time you should talk on the phone and drive is if its an emergency with your kids, mom, husband, or dad. You probably shouldn't then but i know i would because i would want to know what's going on with either of them.

Texting and driving causes many wrecks, and kills hundreds of people each year. And it's all over a simple little text you could have read after you got to a stopping point or could have even waited until you got home. I risk my life every day just like any other person just by texting and driving and the text dont even be that important but to me it is. Over 50% of crashes are because of people who text and drive. When you are engaged in a conversation from calling or even texting your attention is divided causing you to hit something or someone and who's to say you will make it out of that?

There are so many ways texting and driving can be permitted, even if you have to leave your phone at home just to run to walmart do it!! Because no phone is worth losing your life over i promise it's more to that. A simple "ok" text could lead into you getting in a wreck being left in critical condition with doctors telling your family "you might not make it" do you want that to happen? Think about texting and driving before you do it, it's never the answer it can wait.
