I think driveless cars will be great for the future and not so great. Driveless cars will be a good experince for us; we don't have to be bored driving anymore, because the car is driving by itself. The negative part of it is the goverment will allow it, they almost banned the hover boards in some states.

First, thing what will be the cause and the effect of this. The cofounder said " Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no needs them anymore." By him saying that he meant there will no more jobs for the employees at the public-transport system. But there is alot of chances of being a uber driver, there won't be a problem driving people around, because your car drive by itself.

Second, the best thing of this car project is it bring alot of money in the U.S.

This project can help alot of people. For an example, there are few people that have no legs that is unable to drive,but by using driveless cars will be more easier for them. All they have to use is their hand to steer it.

Finally, my conclusion I am arguing with the author, because he is saying facts about it
