I agree with the principal's decision to have students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. My reasons are it will help students make friends and get to know each other better, students will learn how to work with others better, and it will help keep kids out of trouble by keeping them occupied. These benefits will make students happy, and help the well being of them in school and outside of school. Students will have a group to fit in with at school and people to support them when they are struggling.

It will help students make friends and get to know each other better which can make students feel more comfortable at school especially for people that just moved to the school and are new. The school will also be a better place with more friendships and with more familiarization between people throughout the school. Whether or not students already have lots of friends, they will still be able to make more friends or develop friendships. The school will have more positive relationships between students.

Students will learn how to work with others better. That will help when a student has to work with people they don't know well or maybe even don't like. Students will have to work with new people when they have a job and work on other group projects. Students will probably get better grades on group projects when they know how to work well with each other and divide up the work. They might even become happy to work on group projects in school. The teachers also won't need to teach students how to work well with each other, which is one less thing to teach.

It will help keep kids out of trouble by keeping them occupied. Some students probably get bored at home after school and decide to cause trouble to pass the time and keep themselves entertained, but that is less likely to happen when they are engaged in an extracurricular activity. Students might decide that they don't have to cause trouble anymore when they are happy with the extracurricular activity they are involved in. Students that cause trouble can learn better behaviors the more they are working together with other people.

Students will be better at creating friendships when they meet new people, they will be able to have good people skills after working with different people, and more kids will avoid bad behaviors from getting bored. Extracurricular activities will help students later in life with things like college and jobs, when having good people skills will be critical. Overall students will learn how to be better people, have more joy in their lives, and will have more success in life with extracurricular activities.
