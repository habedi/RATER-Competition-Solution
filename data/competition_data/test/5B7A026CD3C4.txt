Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Home schooling is when a student does school at home with a parent or online. Some would say that home school is not right and that it is important to go to public school to socialize and make friends.

Students sometimes home school because they may have trouble learning with other people around. This could because of social anxiety when you have social anxiety it is hard to focus on learning when you always feel like someone is judging you. I myself do not learn well in a room full of people because I am always thinking of other things like, are they looking at me, I wonder what they are thinking about me, and all of these thoughts float around my head while i should be learning.

Bullying is very serious it can make someone want to be home schooled. When someone is getting bullied it is very hard to learn in school because you are worried that the bully is going to do or say something all the time. I was bullied once and I know that it is hard to concentrate on school when you are scared all the time.

A lot of kids have ADHD and that makes it super hard to focus in a public school. ADHD makes you concentrate on any thing other than what you should be doing and you get distracted easy. There is less distractions at home like you cant get distracted with talking to friends, you cant get distracted by what the other students are doing, and you will be on task because at home you will have someone to see you getting distracted and help you to not get distracted.

All of the reasons kids do not like public schools comes back to being home schooled. I think that home school is a great thing and it should always be an option for students.
