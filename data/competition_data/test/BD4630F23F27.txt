People who drive vehicles should not be able to use their cell phones while driving. It can cause bad effects like a car crash or probably even more than what you can realize. It can be very dangerous. Did you know it can be more dangerous than drinking and driving?

Using a cell phone while driving can be harmful because you are not looking on the road and you are looking at your phone so you do not know what is going on around you. Also you can cause somebody else life that is doing the right thing while you are doing the wrong thing on the road. For an example you can be behind somebody and what if they press the breaks hard or stop and you do not know you just think they kept going ad you are on your phone and then boom car accident and it's going to be your fault because you were on your phone not paying attention to the road and then you have to pay for somebody else car damage and yours so the outcome would not look good for you either way. Another thing is you can get pulled over by a police and lose your license.

Another reason you should not text and drive is because you can end up seriously injured or probably killed. For an example in 2010 30,296 are deadly killed and 2,239,000 injured people that has been in a crash because of using their cell phones. People do not realize it can happen to them until they do it because people think it's not but when it does they can say nothing or if they are injured they are going to tell their friends and family do not do it and stuff like that and how it's not safe because they realize it's not nothing to be joking around with. Another reason driving and texting is not safe is you can get a ticket by the police officer. Also your car insurance will be more than what you are probably paying now and it might be hard for you to obtain it and stuff like that if you got other stuff you have to pay for.

Unless you want to end up in a wheelchair or in the hospital do not text and drive wait until you get in a rest area or pull over to the side if it is that important. Therefore, do not text and drive or there will be consequences.
