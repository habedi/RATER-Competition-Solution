Dear Principle,

Wanting to change the policy about participating in sports and other activities, so that it says that you can not participate in sports or other activities unless you have a grade average of B or above, I think is not a very good idea. I do not think this is fair because a C is not failing and to some kids they have C' s even if they are trying their hardest. Also a C is not a failing grade, therefore some families think that a C is a good grade. Having a B or above in each class is very hard. Not letting kids with C' s participate may make them think that they are stupid, which is not true.

It is not a good idea to change the policy during the year because many kids have C' s so many kids will not be able to participate.

If not many kids are participating we will lose in many sports, which is not good for our school.
