Our principal has decided that all of us students must take at least one extracurricular activity. While other students may disagree with this rule I strongly agree with this new decision. This new rule can help students later on with life skills or just finding their passion. The new rule can also help the school with task such as making the yearbook and making sales.

My first reason I agree with this decision is that students can use the skills from their classes later on. If you take a language class it can help with communication to other people that dont speak English. If you want to work on computers when you get older taking a computer class can help. Using skills from the classes you take can help later for jobs when you are no longer in school.

My second reason I agree with this decision is that taking these extracurricular classes can help a student discover a new hobby of theirs. At first you may not like your new extracurricular class but later on the class may become fun to do and maybe even your favorite class. I know this because I used to hate programming in computer class but now I find it very fun to do!

My third and final reason I agree with this decision is that it can help the school. If the school doesn't have a yearbook team the teachers have to make it together and that can take forever. With a team of yearbook students they can interview people for quotes, surveys for the yearbook, and make it look better overall. Another activity is sports and with sports you can do sales and make extra money for the school by selling tickets for games and food. Without a school sports team some fund raisingÂ money would be lost for things the school needs like new equipment or supplies for students.
