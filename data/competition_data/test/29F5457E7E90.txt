Many people might think that taking part in extracurricular activities is a waste of time. However, it could be the one thing that can take people out into the world of different hobbies and opportunities. Extracurricular activities can be greatly beneficial in so many ways. For example, students can explore different hobbies that may be of interest to them and students can make lots of new friends as well. Students also gain a lot of experience that they can carry over into their everyday lives; there really isn't a downside to participating in after school activities! Participating in extracurricular activities can be beneficial, for it will help students make new friends and learn new hobbies and skills.

Making new friends is only one of the positive outcomes of having students participate in after school activities. In this modern age you don't need facts and statistics to tell teachers and staff that many students these days are suffering from bullying, cyber bullying, and loneliness. There are lot's of kids out there that don't feel like they will ever fit in with the rest of the students. Although it may seem nice to blend in with everyone else, everyone is different in their own unique way. This should be celebrated and not ridiculed. Therefore, joining after school activities and making friends that have the same interest as you can really be beneficial. When a student joins a club or sport that appeals to them, they will inevitably be surrounded by other classmates that have the same interests as them. When people are around others that have the same interests it often leads to friendships.

Joining after school activities could also cut down on bullying, for students could worry more about their friendships rather than focusing on bullying somebody else which could be very beneficial for students. It could help them focus more on their new friends and school work rather than the bully that's waiting for them down the hall. Making new friends isn't the only positive outcome of participating in extracurricular activities. Learning about new hobbies and skills is another positive effect as well.

A wonderful result of joining extracurricular activities is that students can learn about new hobbies and skills. There are so many amazing hobbies and activities out there that many students haven't even heard of, and this is where after schools clubs and activities come into play. Students have the opportunity to learn about and experience vastly different subjects that they may not get the time to do elsewhere. Some clubs even teach students valuable lessons about how to cook healthy meals for themselves, appreciate different cultures around the globe, and even community service. All of these different clubs offer valuable lessons and skills that students can carry over into their everyday lives and even when they grow older. It's truly amazing what these clubs have to offer. In fact, another reason is that there may be students that come from lower class families that don't have the opportunity to participate in sports and other leisurely activities. With after school activities students can have the opportunity to experience all of those amazing activities without cost. Extracurricular activities can give students so many amazing experiences and skills that they can carry with them for the rest of their lives.

Extracurricular activities can be really beneficial for students, for students get to make new friends and learn about new hobbies and skills. Making friends can help students by making them feel more included and like they belong. Furthermore, it could also cut down on bullying in schools. Learning about different hobbies and skills is beneficial because it can teach students valuable lessons and expand their interests. In the end, extracurricular activities should be a requirement in all schools because of how beneficial they can be to students.
