Dear: principal

Community service is a punishment, we cannot be forced to serve community service unless we get in trouble. You cannot force us to do community service, it is unfair. If people wanted to do community service, they would volunteer. Community service will get in the way of our free time, school already takes away 5 days of the week. Now you want to waste more of our time. You should not force us, that's why people have jobs. People get paid to clean up the streets or to work at the animal shelter, and you want to force us. If you want to make us do community service then at least pay us. Its going to be just like when slavery was commited, you will forcing us to work with no pay. I thought slavery was banned and you want to start it all over again. But this time not on African Americans, but on kids.

People that want to do community service will volunteer, instead of being forced to do the work you should give us the work but give us something in return like no homework, more lunch time or free dress, but you should not force us. Helping the community is great but some people don't want to. Community service is a punishment and it should stay that way.

sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
