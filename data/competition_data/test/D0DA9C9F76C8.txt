There are many advantages to not driving a car like less polution and smog which makes our days more sunny and nice, people will be more healthy and it will help people with their physical health with how they will have to walk, or ride a bike just to get places.

In paris, people with even numberd licens plates were orderd to on monday to not drive their car anywhere or they would be fined a $31 fine if they did and on tuesday the same for odd numbered and the result was that alot of their smog was cleared and that helped them alot, so if we did the same then we might see dramatic results.

In places such as Bogota they do a no car day and they have less stress and less smog but sometimes it does rain on them but the stress is reduced because of not much traffic and people trying to make them angry, care crashes could easly be avoided if people did not drive very often, I think the stress was reduced because the people were able to enjoy the outdoors for what it was.

If people did not drive cars with alot of bulk and that just guzzle alot of gas, then their weather would not be so weird and they would be more able to do the things they want like go the becah, ride a bike, hike, and just hang out with people they want to and not just hope that it will be ok tomorrow, most people who dont drive often and just do something more meaningful have a longer healthyer life rather than people with truck diesel, or regular gasoline.

Having gasoline smoke in your lungs can have just the same amount affect as when some one smokes around you, it gets in your lungs and it will cut your breathing ability down by half and then everything you do will seem harder to do just because your lungs are not helping you breath just like they use to, and the pollution will make you more sick so adding on to your lungs feeling like someone is standing on then you also are sick, so now you have to just sit down so not to make it worse.

If you exercise enough and dont drive your car very often then you can stay healthy and do good int the process for yourself and you might have an effect on others to do the same then it will become a natural thing to just get outside and not need to drive your car alot, just moderate.

Alot of smog comes from places such as New York, Paris, Bogota..... because they all have alot of people and therefor alot of cars so people all over that place have car after car so they get angry and unhealthy and if they would just leave the car alone once in a while then they will have less traffic, less smog and more people just happy to be there.
