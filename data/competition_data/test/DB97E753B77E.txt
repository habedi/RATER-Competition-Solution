I had just returned home after my long journy to China and we needed knew Seagoing Cowboys. So at the dock I gave a mighty speech but no one thought that being a "Seagoing Cowboy" interested them. Well atleast after this one person started an argument.

Have you ever wanted to travel the ocean blue? Are you good with animals? Do you want to help conties ineed after war? If so you should join thye "Seagoing Cowboys." People were starting to come up when a young man shoted out "stop". "Do you really want to go out to sea and have to work with stinky animals? And have no exictment in your life. You could stay home and care for your family or join the army." The crowd then started to move back and no one wanted to sign up. I was not giving up this easy we needed more help.

I then shout their is plenty of exictment. Also " The cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy." I got to see Europe and China. When you get to a new coutry you have some down time to explore. Also listen to this " The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been." Then the man shouted again " Do you really think playing were animals pooped and peed and who knows what would be fun?" Everyone backed off again.

We then kept shouting till a few people joined. I could not get everyone to join because of the young man but a handfill was good enough. To end it all i said ' I'm greatful for the opportunity." " It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."

A few days later we borded again just waiting for our journy to begain.
