Have you ever woke up and told yourself, there is no way i'm leaving this bed? Distant learning by online classes offers that to you, and I am 100 percent for distant learning. Online school has many benefits compared to regular school.

If you have a fever or are midly sick you can still go to class, because your class is your computer! Unless your very sick, you don't have an excuse not to boot up your computer and start learning. Many people in high school suffer from bullying, and bullying will not be an issue when you are at home. There are also a lot of people, like me, who are not morning people and cannot make the bell everyday and then get punished for it. School starts at a crazy early time, plus you need an hour or so to get ready and commute. It would take 10 minutes for breakfast and then your ready to go, and can start at anytime you please.

There is also many things that don't benefit you. Some kids would see this as the easy way out and not put full effort. And when a teacher asks you to do an assignment, you do it. But when a computer asks you to, maybe you do it. It is much different when a computer and a human ask you to do something. Going to online school could also lose you a social life if you choose to never leave the house.

There a lot of things good and some bad about online school, but I feel like it ends up benefitting you if you choose to put yourself out there and take it seriously.
