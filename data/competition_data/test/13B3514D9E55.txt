I think extracurricular activities can be very beneficial to some kids. There is so much you can learn. When participating in an extracurricular, you can really enjoy yourself and have fun, get to experience new experiences, and they can help you get something thats stressing you off your mind.

You can have so much fun being involved in an extracurricular activity. There are so many different choices to choose from. You can choose things such as sports, arts, or just something fun for a class with a teacher. They are all fun options and you can do all of them if you would like or if you have time. It can also help you meet new friends with the same interests. Maybe there's a girl or boy that you didn't think you had anything in common with but now y'all participate in the same extracurricular. They have many different benefits. If you stay after for things like sports then that can help you become more active or if you stay after for arts, then you can learn many different things like taking pictures or playing with clay.

Extracurricular activities can help you get out of your comfort zone. Maybe you might make new friends or even a new friend group. There are so many different possibilities. Sometimes people worry too much about school and don't have time for fun things. I think that the activities will help. It's okay to give yourself some free time. Many people don't get to try new stuff. Some people get scared to play a sport because they think people will judge them. People shouldn't be able to control what you want to do. Even if your not good at that sport then just play it for fun. Don't play competitively but play for yourself. And if people don't think that you can do it, prove them wrong. If you don't think you can do something then try it out to see because sometimes we doubt ourselves. I think people should be able to do whatever they want and get to try new things because sometimes you find something you really like.

I also think that they can be very good because they may help you stop stressing about something that has been on your mind. If you do a sport, then you will be way too busy exercising to even think about anything else. When your being active nothing else should be going on in your head other than the sport you're playing. If you do arts, then you're gonna have way too much time having fun and not worry about what else is going on in the world. In art you want to have tons of focus to make something pretty. You don't want to just rush and make something bad or ugly. If you do something that your really enjoying, then I don't think you will be able to stress about anything that's happening in your life. It really takes your mind off stuff and many people, including students with tons of stress, need that. It's good to take some "me" time once in a while and do an activity that you will enjoy.

I think every student should do one extracurricular activity after school. Sometimes students have too much work going on at school and another activity is not what they want but maybe it's what they need. If you keep stressing that you have too much more than you have no motivation to actually do it. Maybe an extracurricular that you really enjoy can be that motivation. Extracurricular activities have many different benefits for many different people. Students and teachers can really benefit from them. Extracurricular activities should be something that everyone can enjoy.
