In Koea, there is a old saying that says "Don't catch the fish for the kids, but teach them how to catch it." It means challenging itself is the only way to improve and it is better for people to learn for themselves instead of getting help on everything from other people. Some schools reuquire summer project for students during the break. Some teachers design the projects for their students, but some let their students to design them. Hoever, the summer projects should be student-designed for students' creativity and remembering the content.

First, the summer projects should be student-designed because it helps the students to improve their creativity. When students design their own unique project, they have to come up with personal idea to imply on the project. Since they need their own idea, students have to think more about the theme, content, type of project, and all the things that they might want to put in the project. This process helps the students to think a lot deeper than teachers giving specific directions which helps to improve their creativity.

Second, the summer projects should be student-designed becuase it helps the students to remember the learnings. When students design their own project, they need to remember and understand what they have learned during the school year well enough to evaluate into a project. It requires them to think about the contents for a long time and go through the notes or text books for informations. This process helps the students to reorganize the informations in their brain which eventually allows them to have longer memory on the learnings.

However, even though student-designed summer projects help students to improve creativity and remember the content, there might be people who does not agree with this statement. Some might say that it takes too much time and effort to design the projects themselves and summer break is the time for the students to rest, spend time with their own family members and friends, and use their effort on extracurricular activities. However, they can arrange their schedule to make time for the projects and they can decide whether to make the project big or small. Other may argue that students might have hard time doing the project since it is not instructed. However, it is true that people improve and grow when they challenge themselves. It is better to have challenge for the students, which is the self-designed project. Also, since the students can design the project, they can design it to their own aility.

Since it helps the students to improve their creativity and helps them to remember the lessons better, the summer projects should be student-designed. Challenging themselves is the only way for them to improve and have more experience. It is the better way of learning.
