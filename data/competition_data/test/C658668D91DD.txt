It will kill you, maybe not today, but all it takes is a second. Texting and driving has become the number one cause of car accidents. It is very distracting and it sure does not do any good for anyone. Nothing is as important as someone's life, especially a text message. It can wait until you reach our destination. Using cellphones while driving is extremely dangerous and should not be allowed at all.

Texting and driving seems simple but it is not, it distracts the driver and it puts the driver's life as well as others in danger. In today's society many teen drivers own a cellphone and are constantly on them for social media. Most of these drivers use their phones while driving. According to teensafe. com, 58% of teen crashes has been linked to distracted driving. It only takes three seconds after a driver takes their eyes off the road for a crash to occur. Social media and all the other platforms are such a distraction for the younger generation of drivers and it has led to fatal incidents.

People who use their phones while driving typically use it to text someone or post something on social media and what they don't realize is the dangers of that one text message. When driving, if someone texts you, they can wait until you are not driving for a response. Nothing will ever be more important than being safe on the road while driving, meaning not being distracted. Although calling someone while driving does distract the driver, it is a little safer than texting and driving. As long as the call is bluetooth and handsfree then there is no problem with that being allowed while driving. There should be an exception to that which is that any driver under the age of 18 should not have their phones out at all, not even wireless calling.

Texting and driving has no beneficial outcome, so there is no reason to do it. A distracted driver could get in a car accident and get killed. They could also injure someone else and then be left with the consequences of it. The insurance will be raised very high, there will be medical bills for the injured party that has to be paid, there will be fines to be paid, possible jail time, and suspension of your driver's license. Nothing good comes from texting and driving. The vehicles after a wreck will be damaged and it will just be unnecessary stress and problems added to a driver's life that could have been prevented.

Many states, including California, has already banned the use of cellphones while driving. There is a hands-free law that prohibits having a cellphone in your hands while driving. Distracted driving is never a good idea, no matter how important someone believes the message is. Distracted driving leads to fatal accidents and deaths of many people. Using electronic devices while driving should be prohibited.
