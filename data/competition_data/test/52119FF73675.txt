dear principal, i think that it doesn't matter if you have a C its still good and its not failing either i think you should still be able to play sports and do activities no matter what! Its important that students stay fit as long as they can, and this would be a great opportunity for students because it gives them a little bit of free time and it also gives them strength and focus, and you also want your students to stay healthy. and that also goes for activities too! well most students are not focused because of the amount of work they do everyday at school. i am a kid and i know how that goes, you start off doing great but then you start getting tired and then you just stop, so you should let us students have sports and activities no matter if you have a C

because I'm sure you would see more approved then less, so i don't think you should change the school policy i think its great just the way it is!
