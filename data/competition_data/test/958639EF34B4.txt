Dear Principal,

I know from having experience that kids need time to be themselves and express themselves through leisure activities or sports. The average grade for most to all school is a C

I don't understand where your going with this if you expect kids to keep up their grades just to play sports. I'm sure that there are other places where kids can play sports and they could and most likely will continue to get the average grade because that's what kind of student they are. Its hard for all kids to succeed in school knowing that all the can do all day every day is school related work. They need to have a break in order to think and process information that they learned the previous night or day. I understand where you are going when you say kids need to have good grades because without them they can not get in to a college and fulfill their goal. School comes first i agree.

I don't agree with the having to have a B average to play sports. Its hard enough for some kids to get good grades but now they wont be able to do something they enjoy if you take that away. This whole issue might result in you not having kids playing sports for your school or having a bad sports team which i don't think or at least hope you don't want. When it comes to kids having bad grades i think you should give them a chance to bring it up i understand if they have a D average but a C is the average grade for most middle to high school students and that wont change. I respect the fact that you want kids to do well at your school but without having sports and maintaining a C average will push them over the edge.

When you think about it most kids are average to above average students and that could be taken away if you take away their privilege to play sports for being an average kid. I know that I have a above C average and this wouldn't affect me, but it would effect my friends and they are excellent at sports. It would take away their one chance to express themselves and their feelings.

I hope you see that this is not a good idea. I don't want my expression and love for sports to be taken away because I'm average. There's nothing wrong with being average. Kids need to express themselves not only through the work and effort they put into school work but the work and effort they put in to sports and other activities. This all depends on you and your thoughts but i totally and completely disagree with this policy.

Sincerely,
