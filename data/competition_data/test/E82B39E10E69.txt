Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students at school probably to not want to Attend in a community service group or club. Community service is not really a job for students. It is more of a job for people in jail. Most students also attend in sports like football, soccer, baseball/softball and basketball. They would probably be practicing for a big game coming up or just try to get better because maybe that's what they want to be when they get older is a famous basketball player, soccer player, football player, Bike Rider, Skateboarder, Baseball/softball player for their job or life. Students might have things to do like studding. If people did not litter this would be so much easier so students and people in jail didn't have to clean up after them. Picking up trash off the side of the road is not a students job. That could also take away time of their education. Taking away their education would not be a good idea if someone in that group wants to be able to go to college or a university. Not everyone will but a lot of people want to do something with their life or help people like help people out in nursing homes and give them company. Theirs a lot you could help people with and it can help save our wold as well. yes , Picking up trash can save our would but that is only if they want to. If you make a Community Service and people join it then that would work. Most do like to help their cities/towns but a lot of people are interested in their education and what they are going to do with their lives. A lot people do not plan on working by picking up trash.
