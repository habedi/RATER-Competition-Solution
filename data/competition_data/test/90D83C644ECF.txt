Dear Principal, I think that policy number one is better for students.

I think this because, some students need cell phones to communicate to others such as parents or guardians.

They would use them incase of emergencies. I also think that the students would appreciate that rule better because, they want to have their cell phones with them at all times and if you take that privilege away, then they might get really mad and start disobeying the rule anyway. it's pointless. It would also help parents as well. It would help the parents because some parents might not know the school's number and call their child instead. If the student did not have his/ her phone with them because of a rule, then the parent would not be able to reach anyone.

Another reason why I think that policy number one is better is, because the students would learn more because they know that they are allowed to use their phone on their own free time and lunch. The students would have no reason to not pay attention in class. Therefore, they will most likely get better grades and probably pass their classes. The school will also be a happier environment.

On the other hand, this can lead to one thing. Bullying. Allowing students to use their phones on their free time can lead up to cyber bullying.

When other students hear a rumor about someone doing something, they would want to text it to their friends right away. When one person finds out, and they know its about them, then they could get really hurt. Also, others can send text messages to others talking about someone, and when the victim goes to talk to the person who received the text, that person might not want to talk to them because of "what they did".

Other than the bullying, I still think that policy one is the best choice for our school. It helps others communicate. It helps make friends, and it gives the school a better look to it.

I hope you agree with me on my choice. Thank you.

From, Student.
