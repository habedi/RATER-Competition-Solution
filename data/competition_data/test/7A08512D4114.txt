Picking up trash will be good for the community and our school it will make the school look cleaner and healthier. I think students should be required to pick up trash so that they can see what people are doing and why it is wrong to litter. I know it will take some time to clean up our school and community but it is well worth it. If people and kids keep littering the world will not be safe for us to live in and many people might get very sick and even die!

Cleaning up the community is good because it will allow more people to move in our neighborhood and that means that it will be more families with kids and we get to hang out with them. Another good reason for picking up trash is because some people might come and visit our community and might not want to come back and visit it again. I would like them to go back home and tell their friends and family that Columbus is a great place to visit. I think if kids get caught throwing trash on the floor they should pick it up and pick up the rest of trash outside at our school.

Helping kids will be good for the community by helping the younger kids by passing the test to get on to the next grade, and so that they will not struggle in the next grade. It will provide the kids to get good grades and make there parents, teachers, and their school happy. So if I was the principal I would choose to make all students help out their community.

It could really help us in the future because we are the future kids of America and we choose what is the better America is going to look like in the future! So please let the kids do community service work by picking up trash and helping other kids and other people.
