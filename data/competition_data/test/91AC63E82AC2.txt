Dear Principal,

I believe that you should us the first policy that you are considering. Most students need their cell phones for emergencies, or any other time they need to talk to someone important or make a change of plans. If students were not allowed to have cell phones at school, they would not have any contact with their parents. The only reason most kids have a cell phone is so their parent can have contact with them and know that they are safe.

One reason kids should be allowed to have cell phones at school, is because there might be an emergency. For example, if a kid who relies on the bus to take them home does not have his cell phone on him, and the bus breaks down, he does not have the option to call his parents to come and pick him up. this can cause the parents to worry when their child does not come home on time, and they cannot contact him on his cell phone. parents do not like to worry about their kids, and you might get calls from these worried parents, asking about their child. that would be a big inconvenience for you.

Another reason is that a kid might have after school plans. if those plans got canceled, the child cannot call their parents and tell them what happened, while the parents assume that their son or daughter is at a friends house. the child will have to walk home, which sometimes can take more than an hour depending on where the kid lives. It is important for parents to know where there child is at all times, and that is why if their plans got canceled, they do not have that knowledge.

That is why I strongly believe you should consider your first policy over the second.

Kids need to have contact with their parents, and choosing your second policy would be a bad idea. Parents want to know wher their child is and what they are doing.
