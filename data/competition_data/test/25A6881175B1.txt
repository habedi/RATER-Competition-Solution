Dear Principal,

I think it would be better to have every one should do community service. If every one did this i think our city would be cleaner and healthier. If we were going to do this i would want it to be during school hours. If we did it during school hours people couldn't say that it takes time away from there schedule like sports. Also if we did this during school hours people couldn't tell their teachers that we dent do our homework because we were to busy doing community service.

Another good reason to have every one in our school to do community service to help other kids. If we learned something and some else doesn't get it we could help them with what they don't get. Another good reason to do it during school hours if so someone need help with school work we can help them at school so we don't have to go to their house. Also so if we do it during school and not go to their house more people might want to help because if their at home they wont to take time out of their schedule to help someone.

If every one did it and not just a couple people couldn't make fun of other people for having to clean up trash or helping someone because they will be doing it to. If everyone did this they might be nicer in the future and help someone out because they have already done it once before. I hope you enjoyed reading my letter and taking it in consideration thanks.

sincerely,
