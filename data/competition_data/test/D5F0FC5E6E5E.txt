Summer projects are a good and tested tool to ensure students learn over the extended break known as summer vacation. Teacher designed projects ensure fair, equal, and consistent learning across schooling administrations. These projects will make sure that students are tested upon there merit to applied material that will surely be used in their academic future, and will keep their brain on edge during the mind numbing summer vacation.

Teacher approved projects designed by teachers ensure that each student will be guaranteed to be scored and evaluated on their application of the material, not whether or not the child next to them had a better idea of what to make. This would ensure that Generic_Name; who made a info graphic on the dangers of ethanol products for the environment is graded in the same way as Generic_Name; who made a baking soda volcano the size of a small minivan. By having teachers make and set the guidelines of the project we negate the potential problems of having a student design or think up their own. Opponents of this idea would say that this limits a students imagination and creativity that an original project would be gleaming example of; however by giving them this central idea or framework we can have kids express their creativity by using the aforementioned framework and how they can use it to show their knowledge of the subject while expressing their idea on how they can make the project their own. Teachers this way can ensure that they are able to grade students on a more even field by a class basis instead of student by student. This method would make also make it easier to ensure consistent grading to learn where certain schooling needs fine tuning.

Having students graded by a teacher's syllabus or paper makes sure that should changes need to be made on the certain subject or on the project itself is valuable from an academic standpoint. Also should an academic want to study the affects of this project and academic performance against those who do not perform a summer project they would be able to as they have a consistent group they could study. Not having this ability to make changes would be detrimental to a institutions ability to ensure academic growth in students. This would also make it easier on teachers having to grade as compared to having to grade each kid on their own project. Those against say that it has inherent bias against those who do not achieve their prime when constricted by the limits of a syllabus, an example of this being a student who was traveling for majority of break or where unable to locate a syllabus before the break began. Although having this frame would largely negate these problems as year after year they would know what would expected of the children.

Also having this framework would negate any problems with student loafing or economic problems that a student could face. By having a student constrict to a single option this would allow for less fortunate students to have the ability to compete with his or her more fortunate counterparts; as would in the case of someone purchasing more complicated components against someone who would not have that ability which would be the case in many schools across the country such as Generic_City. With regards to student loafing this would allow for less motivated student to be allowed less of an ability to slack off as they would be unable to put together a project within a short amount of time and earn better scoring than someone who spent more time and effort simply because they had "their own idea".

Having teachers make their own project would make for fair and equal abilities to score across whatever lines may be drawn in the sand. Having teachers design their own would allow institutions to make changes to curriculum and lesson plans should students have a weak understanding of the material. having teachers decide how to grade would make it easier for them to also grade against other groups for academic purposes. It is better for teachers, students, and overall everyone if they could decide what to be graded and what to be expanded upon.
