Luke was a very nice man. He would always do anything for his friends. Luke had a long friend who had came by his place and asked if he wanted to go to Europe , and he said "yes I would love to come with you".

By the time they (Luke and Don) got there they discovered that World war 2 was going on . Everything there was destroyed .

They got asked by men if they would volenteer on helping them with the animals , and they said "yes".

They seen a flier about a job wanted and they deccided to sign up for it.

*Raining* When they started the job Luke was doing his work and he happened to slip down ladders and he fell down and broke a couple of his rib , and that caused him not to work for 2 whole weeks.

And he talked about all his fun times he had like, returning animals, and playing games.

And before he left he gratefully greeted them for the opportunity of the job. And he also made a speech that was said * Luke voice* "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs".
