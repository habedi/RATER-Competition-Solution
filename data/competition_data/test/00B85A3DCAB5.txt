I think using technology to scan someones facial expressions would be a great way for people to interact more with the internet and social media . Even though, many people will disaprove of it saying how it evades there child's privacy. Even though this may happen, there could be some good side effects from this new technology. One good side affect was pointed out by Dr. Huang, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor." Dr. Huang also noted how most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. He then goe's to say how these new computers need to learn how to pick up these emotions and understand them, too. I myself feel that by useing this technology we will be able to help students study more, and concentrate more on there homwork assighnments sence they'll be more engaged in the subject because it peaks there interest. From this I feel like the new technology would be varry valuable not just to students but to teachers as well giveing them the opertunity to get to know the students better and to get to know what there students are interested in wheather it's sports or school work.
