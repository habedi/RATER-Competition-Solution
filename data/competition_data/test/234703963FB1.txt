Using technology to read peoples emotion isn't really valuable to students in the classroom.

As said in this article that it can read human emotion but not for any purpose except changing a lesson to your understanding when you're confused, but other than that there aren't much use for it. In paragraph of the atricle it states, " you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." This statement from the article basically shows that some people already know how to read human emotion ny just looking, so this technology may only be valuable to people who can't read human emotions as good as others.

In the article, it even says "most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication" and also says " so computers need to understand that ,too." In any form of communication, a human understands nonverbal and emotional communication which makes it easier for humans to understand that on another human than technology could.
