From day one, the human race expresses emotion using non-verbal bodylanguage.

Other people can tell if you are happy or sad based on the way you present your body postion and face.

Modern day technology has made it possible for computers to interpret someones emotion based on their facial expression.

This technology could be used in a classroom and can work to help boost moral, keep the student more interested, and help the teacher relay a positive attitude to reproduce in their students.

Some days, when students go to school, they didn't get enough sleep, get a energetic breakfast, or are just simply not having a good day.

With this new Facial Action Coding System, teachers and other faculty in a school will be able to analyze what they can do to boost moral in the classroom.

If the teacher does a fun activity and the technology tells the teacher that the expressions on the students faces were happy, the teachers will know to do that activity to boost moral.

The technology will also be able to tell when the student does not enjoy the activity or experience, and the teacher can work on how to approach it differently the next time.

The teacher will get accurate results on how the students are feeling, which sometimes can be faked.

According to the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", smiles that don't use the obicularis oculi pars palpabraeus, or the muscles that make the crow's feet around your eyes, are not a genuine smile.

From this data a teacher can pull out who is fakeing, and who is not.

There are some subjects in school that students are just not interested in.

The teachers try different approaches, but sometimes nothing seems to work.

The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to detect what kids are interested in and what are not.

The article gives an example of if a computer ad pops on the screen and the reader smiles, then a similar one will appear the next time.

If the reader doesn't smile, an ad not as similar will pop up next time.

This tactic can be used in the classroom.

The computer can observe how a student reacts to playing a educational game, and pass on the information to the teacher.

If the game doesn't interest the student, the teacher needs to make improvements or find a new one.

If the student is interested, the teacher now knows that they can use it and it will be effective.

Some teachers have problems with how their students are reacting to their teaching, and find that it is how they present themselves.

If a teacher is boring, unorganized, and inequipped, the class will respond with a bored attitude.

On the flip side, if a teacher comes to class energetic, engaged, and prepared, the students will respond with a happier, more engaged, and often be more interested in the topic.

The phrase "you fake it 'till you make it" applies to this situation.

A drama coach, by the name of Constantin Stanislavsky, tought his actors how to carefully reproduce smiling and frowning based on the emotions that they presented on stage.

Teachers can use these methods in their classrooms to keep their students engaged and become interested in the topic even if the topic has nothing interesting about it at all.

Studies show that even if you force a smile, you will feel happier.

In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", the author describes how a new technolgy called Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions.

Humans can usally identify small things in their friends faces, but nothing to the degree that this new software has in store.

Using this software in computers in the classroom could mean that teachers could improve moral, keep students more interested and engaged, and reproduce positive attitudes and emotions.
