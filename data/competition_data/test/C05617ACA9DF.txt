The computer could help in the clssroom by telling the teacher how a caertain student is acting or feeling, then the teacher could possbly recognize the face of the student without the computer. The teacher could tell how bad the student is feeling. They could prevent violent actions before the occur.

These computers can help the teacher learn more about the student and what they do when they are feeling a certain. Like when the student is confused the could use the computer and learn to see what student does when he is confused. If the student is confused again, the teacher could walk over to him/her and ask them if they need help.

The teacher could use the computer for better use. They could tell when a student is mad, and send them to the counsler to talk about the situation. If you get the mad student to the counsler, then you could help prevent fights and negative activity in schools. I feel like this computer could make schools a lot better and a lot safer.

This computer could help schools academically and help make it a better/safer place for students. The computer can help the students in so many different ways.
