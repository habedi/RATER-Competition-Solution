Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I think the projects should be teacher designed because the project will designed for what they need to learn and the students will better understand the project if the teacher makes the project.

Firstly, If the teacher designs the project it is better because the teachers know what the students need to learn, so the project instructions will be clear on what needs to be done and what the requirements are. Studies show that the brain is not fully developed until 18. Teenagers need structure, so having the teacher create the project provides that structure.

Lastly, I feel if the project is teacher made the students will more likely do the project. I say this because students are lazy, we procrasnate too much. If a teacher has already planned it out and just tells us what to do, we'll feel more oblagated to do it. Also I feel the project would be taken more serious since a teacher assigned and created the project.

I'd like to add that letting students design their own projects could have some benefits. It could give students a chance to prove that they know the subject and have actually learned. But I think havig the project teacher designed overall would be better because in my case I would like to know what the teacher would like to see from me.

In concuslution, I think that summer projects should be teacher designed because the students will more likely do it and the project will be clear about what the teacher wants to see.
