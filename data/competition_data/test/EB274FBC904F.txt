I think some schools offering learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing is a good thing.

First of all,not all schools has the programs you want to do. Lets say you want to be an I.T, but your school doesn't provide that program in your school. So you look for a different school to go to that has what you are looking for,or an online class to help you when you are not going school maybe you take online classes. Staying home and doing online classes helps too cause you might not have the classes you wanted on your schedule for that school year. This helps students focus on what they want to be in the future.

Secondly, by going to a different school helps with what you want for your future career. You will have teachers that knows more about your future career. You can ask questions about what you need for the career you want to major in ,in the future. Some people can be at home searching up about what they need on the computer while taking an online class. Some people will watch videos of what they are going to be in the future, like me, I learn better when see something or a demonstration of the job I am going to be doing.

Basically, I think student wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, if you are at home you are only going to ask the computer , you are just going to search it up. When you are at school you will have people that knows what is going to happen because the computer is not going to tell you everything. When you are in school, you have teachers that may have had that job before. those teachers may have more experience in it, so you will have more information on the career you are looking for in life.

Some people may auger that staying home and not going to class will benefit you because with don't have to go anywhere. You have everything at your finger tips and it's much easier. Plus you are at home you don't have to walk and ask teacher about what they think about your future career, you can just search it up. And I disagree with that because the computer doesn't tell you the details of you career.

In conclusion student going to classes and having to see or experience whats it going to happen in the future is better than staying home and taking online classes.
