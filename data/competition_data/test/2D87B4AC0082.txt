The Facial Action Coding System technology is a new thing to detect how people are feeling using the computer. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom because it teaches students how to use new technology. Using this system shows the students what all jobs are avalible in the technology field too.

Using technology like this can help improve the way students use computers and help them get jobs. in the future. Most new jobs rely on some sort of technology or require you to know how to use it. With this new tech people might have a job lined up that they did not know about.

This technology can also be good for detecting if someone is feeling bad or is depressed. They can use this as a form of helping people out if no one can tell they are sad. For instence in paragraph three "Eckman had classified six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.". If they can use this to treat people who are not happy it can solve a bunch of problems in the future.

Since they can use this technology to see peoples real emotions they can tell students' emotional expressions. If they are sad they can do something to make them happy again and get better grades. I think this type of technology will become something greater than it already is.
