Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would like to talk to you about whether or not u should make students do community service. I think you should require students to do community service because it is good to help out and clean the planet and help others who need help to succeed in education. Our planet does have a lot of garbage. For Example on the highway u can see a lot of paper bags and napkins all over the side of the highway. if we all help and do community service we could get the highway cleaned up in very short time. Its also exercising because you walk a long distance and many children and teens do not get exercise much this would be good for them to go outside and be with friends and clean up the environment.

You may not notice but a lot of people struggle on certain things in school. It could be math or science or even writing everybody needs a little extra help because they may not be good at it. That's why we should have some students tutor others. It isn't hard to help out. It could just be an hour of your time and it would be better then for you to go home and just rot your brains out by watching television or playing video games. I Bet that the student would really appreciate the help and because you helped them it should make you feel better that you helped out a person with the skills that your good at and helped them with the skills that there not good at. These are the reasons why you should require students to do some community service. Its only an extra hour its not like they may never go home. So i hope that you can require community service for just an hour a week.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
