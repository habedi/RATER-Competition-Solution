Dear Sir/Ma'am,

The idea of not letting kids participate in sports or school activities is on some levels a good idea and a bad idea. There are many ways it could be a bad idea, for instance, some kids might not be able to and if they aren't able to participate then the program won't prosper, which means that the program would serve as no use to the school. It is also a bad idea because parents could look forward to seeing their child out on that field or on the court playing a sport they use to play growing up. Parents that take the time to go to their children's activities are very good parents and would like to see their kids grow up to play one of those sports. It is also a bad idea because maybe basketball or soccer or a sport or activity is all that is keeping that kid out of becoming a criminal.

The idea could also serve some benefits. The fact that some kids couldn't do what they love would make some break down and do all their work to maintain that B average. That alone could be all the school needs to boost test scores. Some kids would probably say that they don't care if they play a sport or participate in any activity, but you would have a vast majority that like to do what they love and doing what you love is what you do best, isn't it?

There are more bad consequences than good, so if it were me i would just leave it the way it is. I mean a C average is better than a D or F average isn't it? So I and many others would say to leave it the same. You are the principal and we are the students. All you want to do is make sure we get a good education. So for the sake of us and our school, please leave it the way it is. Maybe all we need is someone to sit down with us and tells us just how important it is to just do our best. That we don't need to be a genius to get through school that all we need to do is listen to the teachers and do what they say and do it how they show us. Then it wouldn't make it so hard to get through school.

So in conclusion, make an educated decision based on what has happened with other schools that have done the same thing so that way you won't make the wrong decision. You are our principal and we know that all you do is to benefit us. So when you make a decision then just make the decision to leave everything the same. Its done wonders for this long so it should still have some wonders left to work.
