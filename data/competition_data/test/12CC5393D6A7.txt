Luke was working when his friend Don Reist said if he wanted to go europe on a cattle boat. Luke said it was an opportunity of a lifetime. So he didnt give up the chance to go with him. The reasons you should go is that you can see new places that you have most likely never seen before or have never visited before. You will have an experience of how to take care horses,young cows,and mules that would be shipped from place to place.

But along the way you'll find out what it feels like to take care these animals like as if you were on a farm because these are animals that would be on a farm. Besides you could try new food that you could have never tried in your life. You could have a chance to meet new people. Also while in that place you could experience what their culture is and also what they do in that culture. The only places you would go to though would be italy,china,new orleans,and greece.

So on your way these are the places you could explore and visit for a while. So these are the reasons I think you should take the chance to become a seagoing cowboy if you ever got the opportunity to become one.
