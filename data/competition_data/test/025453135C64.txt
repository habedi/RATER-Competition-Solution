To the principal

You have said that you want to change the school policy so that students must have a B average to play sports. But I would like to disagree with that. The sports players play for the school. What I'm trying to say is even though they don't make good grades they may be grate at the sport they play.

The school is in some ways represented by there sports teams and I think that if they do not win games they will be known as a push over and not a good school. You should not need to be perfect to play a sport. To play a sport it just takes willingness and want to be good at that sport.

I'm not saying that students shouldn't make good grades they should but if that student is doing his or her best in school and just making a C average they should still allow that student to play sports and represent his or her school. But that student should all ways try there best at all times. Thank you for your time reading this principle.
