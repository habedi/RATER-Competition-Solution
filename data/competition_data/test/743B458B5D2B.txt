Students that are currently enrolled in schools have been the generation to grow up with new technological advances and harder school programs. With this, distance schooling is not a crazy idea and it may even allow for students to do better and acheive more. As a student currently enrolled in a multitude of AP or DE classes, I can agree that distance learning may be a good source for students that can't attend school for whatever reason. With distance learning students will be able to better their education when they are sick and need to take leave, need a bit of extra help outside of the classroom, and finally for students that have mental disorders or are diseases that limit their ability to go out.

In many cases, espicially in high school, students will avoid missing school when they are sick becasue the benefit of staying home to heal from sickness does not exceed the cost of missing school. High school classes hand out tremendous amounts of work that pile up on students: if students were to miss one day it would turn into weeks of work. Due to the excessive amounts of work, the majority of students prefer to tough it out and go to school. Since students are going to school ill, this provides the oppertunity for students to contaminate the school leaving others at risk of becoming sick. If distance learning was an option it would limit the exposure of sick individuals to the general school population. With distance learning students would then be able to watch videos or online conference with their teachers so that they don't miss anything important during class.

Another benefit that distance learning may have is the ability for students to gain extra help. For many students the learning pace during school is too fast and hard to keep up with, but with the use of distance learning students would be able to watch videos at home or conference privately with their teachers. Along with a fast learning pace, some students may feel embaressed or shy during class and don't like asking questions. Through online video conferencing students can ask their teachers one on one questions privately. Some people believe that if a student doesn't understand a lesson or can't ask questions during class that its their own fault and should have to deal with it on their own by getting a tutor. Although tutors are an excellent tool, they are costly and some students may have to work after school or play sports leaving them no time for extra help outside of school. Through distance learning students can access the extra help they need by opening there laptop to watch a video compared to spending excess amounts of money and time on a tutor.

Finally, distance learning would be able to help those that can't attend school, physically or mentally. Today in society more than a fourth of the population suffers from some sort of mental or physical disorder which limits the way they preform during school.

I know a number of poeple that suffer from a disorder like Anxiety or ADHD and can't preform well during school and have to wait to get home to complete their work. Since these students can't focus in a busy environment, like the classroom, they don't learn during class and have to teach themselves the lesson at home. Since they are teaching themselves the material they often miss information or the inforamtion is wrong.

For students that have physcial disabilities or diseases and can't leave there home or the hospital, they would still be able to learn like a "normal" student in a classroom setting. With the use of distance learning these students would be able to watch videos and conference with teachers to help learn and improve their education.

People may believe that with distance learning comes a big price tag attached. However the cost of ditsance learning shouldn't be too high. Most students and staff have access to a computer or some sort of technology that will provide them the oppertunity to watch videos online or video conference with a teacher. Through distance learning it gives students so many advantages that were not provided to the older generations including allowing students to learn at home when they are sick, giving students the oppertunity to receive extra help, and finallly granting students with diseases and disorders the ability to learn in a classroom settting. With the use of distance learning it would provide students with resources that other generations never had to help better their quality of education.
