Some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue learning during summer vacation. How would you like it if your son or daughter came home and told you that they have a summer project that needs to be completed? Most of the students would rather have the project be student based due to it bringing out their creativity and their personality better.

First and foremost, creativity is one of the most valuable part about some because without creativity what is a person. Creativity needs to be looked upon on because if you do not have any creativity what new ideas could you come up with. On that hand, they can pick what they want to do as a summer project so they could be interceded to do it because its showing what they can do as a person and how creativity they are as a student at that school. What can a teacher do if he or she does not have any creativity in the classroom? when you look at schools today they are more worried on, how can I get this student to pass, or, how can i get this child to get a B on this paper.

Secondly, students would gather together and say that being able to pick what they want to do as their project would say that it brings out their personality better. They would have the choice to chose what they want to do as their summer project they would chose to do it on by themselves with no one telling them what they have to do. It would bring independence in the classroom due to everyone having their own ideas and thoughts that could show in the way they do their summer projects. The students have more of a variety to pick form because they can have their own ideas on their summer projects.

However, a very little hand full would say that they would love for their teacher to give them a summer project that the teacher picks for them because they do not have any independence to do what they want to. They need someone with them to help hem all the time and does not do anything in the classroom or at home because they have someone there to do it for them. But on the other hand you have students that are willing to take the challenge and conquer it because they have discipline and independence in their lives and are willing to do things on their own.

To finish everything off, most students would say that have creativity and personality are the two best best things to have because without them how could you go day living like you lived yesterday. For most people they want to be nothing alike most people because, what is the point of fitting in when you can stand out and still get things done that you could have got done with a group. The number one thing that matters here is that teachers need to let students do what they want to do as far s projects go because if you look at it students get better grade when they do it on themselves other than with a teachers help.
