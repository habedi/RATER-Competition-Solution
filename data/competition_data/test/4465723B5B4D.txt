Its always a good idea to be participating in after school or in school activities. A really good time to start would be in middle or high school. The reasons for it being a good idea is it gives experience for the future,helps prepare you for the future and helps you figure out what you like.

First things first getting experience is very critical to do before leaving school and going into the big world. Its good for applying to jobs and generally preparing for what you could do. This could ,also help by showing you what you might be good at that you didnt know you where or help you to get better if your not good at something or dont know how too do something. Participating in after school or even in school activities could help give you just that. It will really help for future events.

Next thing is that participating in school activities could prepare you for the future. It doesnt seem like a big deal to be participating in school activities, but it is. Knowing and learning more things about different things outside of school gives you options for what you could do n the future. it also gives a chance to learn about things you might need to use in the future. This also gives a good idea of what it might be like in the future and could very much help along the way.

Lastly participating in school activities helps you learn about you. school activities are there for that reason knowing what you like is the most important thing. knowing who might wanna be someday is also important. these activities are there to help you figure that out by finding out what you like and who you wanna hang out with , and how you work etc. what you like doing is apart of these activities and what they are made for.

In conclusion knowing more about you, getting experience and preparing for the the future arent bad things to start doing. participating can simply change your future. This can change who you become and effect what you do one day. You might even find that what you thought you wanted to do or who you wanted to be you dont want that anymore.

so next time you have a chance to try something new or start participating in something that you have been wanting to do, do it . it could change the future of you.
