Online schooling or video conference? I support this way of learning for students, who feel the need to stay home or not getting to school and deaing with distractions that can stop them from learning. Staying home and learning sounds amazing because you wouldn't have to get up, get dressed, or worry about other students at school and their drama.

Learning at home sounds like a comfortable learning environment. Some students take this opportunity because either they were pregnant,moving a lot, or have anxiety that makes it hard to communicate with other peers and teachers at school. For me being in school is not a good idea I wish that I was able to take online school or at least a video conference with a teacher. Having anxiety makes it hard for me to learn at school because in class I always feel like people are always judging me or talking about me because I didn't do the homework or I got an answer wrong. Socializing with other people I don't know triggers my anxiety and makes me feel some type of way that doesn't make me want to come to school. The reason I have never brought this up to my parents about putting me into online school is because I have supporting friends and Its my last year of high school and I know I can do this and other students.

I noticed that distractions can also prevent students from learning. Distractions are everywhere,but at school theres way more. Students drama is the worst thing ever because rumors and gossip can really effect a students learning environment. In my sophomore year of high school my friend who was also a sophomore. One day in class we got a new student who came from another school, so my teacher made my friend show him around the school and everything so he could feel welcomed to this school. After a couple of days these group of girls came up to my friend and the new student and started to say really awful things about her, she went crying home. Few days later she texted me saying that she will be doing online school to stay away from distractions and get her school stuff together. From this experience that happened to my friend i think that was the best option.

When the teacher is teaching in a big class it is sometimes very hard to understand most of the time. Having a video conference with a teacher and learning one on one can really benefit from you learning. With these reasons,explanation,and experience I very much think for some students this option would be a really good idea.
