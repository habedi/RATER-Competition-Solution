Some Schools require students to do a project over break. But should the project be student-designed, or teacher-designed? Projects over break should be student designed. For one, students could make there project on something they learned a lot about, and something they were interested in. Another reason students should pick there own project is that they will run wild with it. If you let them pick there own, they will try there hardest to make there project great, because it's something they connect well with and they want to show the Teacher. And finally, its over break, which really should mean that they are work free, so if your going to give them a project, at least make it one they can pick from.

If I were a student, and I was given a project over break, and you were told it had to be whatever they said, you probably wouldn't do it. And if you did, you probably had a little trouble getting all those facts. But if you were allowed to pick from something that you wanted, it would get done with ease. You could pick somthing you're comfortable with, and something that you learned a lot about. If the teacher picked it for you, and you didn't know a lot about it, you would have to start from scratch and do a lot of research, and that would waste a good break.

If you were to give a student a resticted project on somthing they have to do it about, they can only go so far with it. If they didn't know much about that subject, or if they just didn't really pay attention. They arn't going to do as well. But if you give a student a project based on what they want to do it on, they will be able to take it above and beyond. They will know so much about what they are presenting on, it will be like there own personal project, that they can even teach the Teacher about, because of how well they know it.

As a student right now, I know how awsome it is to have a break. Just some time to sit back, relax, clear your head from all the stress, and anxiety build up, and take some time off to enjoy yourself. But, I also know how it feels to have a break, and some teacher-assigned project thats due first day back. It is harder than normal school life, because you are trying to get that project done, that you only know a little bit about, and make time to enjoy yourself. Its more stressful then just going to school. But, if you are given a rubric, and you are allowed to make a project on whatever you want, you would be able to enjoy making it, and you would have that time to yourself.

In conclusion. A student-assigned project over break, would be a million times better, than a teacher-assigned one. There is not as much stress, because you know about what you are presenting on, and you can still enjoy your break, because thats what there for. So, maybe if you are given a teacher-assigned project over break, go talk to him/her about it. Tell him/her personally that, you would like to bring in a project based on what, you learned about.Â
