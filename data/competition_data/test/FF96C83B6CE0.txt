In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests hat studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supprts this idea carfully by giving clear evidence in the text. He goes on to describe the likelyhood of the past on Venus, the conditions in which sutdying the planet would take place, and how studying the planet may benifit the human race.

To begin with, the author makes a valid point by starting off with an explaination of the likely hood of Venus's features being closely related to those of Earth. The author goes on to tell the reader about the crucial consideration of visiting Venus. In the artical, it clearly states that "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solr system." (Paragraph 4.) And goes on to tell, in detail, how "Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth." Giving clear examples of the likely hood that life could have very well been on Venus.

Furthurmore, the author also claims that the conditions Venus demonstrates, while studying its features and possible living conditions, could very well be possible given the right equiptment and procedure. The artical claims that Venus can, very well, be studied, and that "Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningful to our knowledge of Venus." (Paragraph 6.) Given this example, it seems as though the author has a very well thought out point.

In addition, the author goes on to explain how benifitial studying Venus can be for the human population, and for the sake of science and curiosity in itself. For example, in paragraph 8, the author states "Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." In other words, this tells us that we can and will gain from the planet, and possibly grow knowledge wise of the unknown mysteries on Venus.

To wrap things up, the author states clearly the facts on how dangerous studying and taking in information on Venus could truely be through-out the artical, but also gives valid points on the subject to support to his idea that "studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers it presents." Including how it benifits, and the likely hood that the past could become a mere future depending on technology and the studys that can be found. The author makes very clear and considerable points in his argument.
