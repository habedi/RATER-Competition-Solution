An extracurricular activity is something that only a few students take part in, but if every student had to join an activity, they would all have somewhere they want to be, and be doing something they enjoy, instead of going home right away and not having the fun a young person should be having. Extracurricular activities are a way for students to enjoy learning, learn in a non-stressful environment, and have fun while doing it. I agree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it gives students an opportunity to learn new things and meet others who might have the same interests, have something fun to do after the school day, and become part of a group.

Making extracurricular activities mandatory can give students opportunities to learn new skills, and meet others who could share the same interests. Students who join an extracurricular activity they enjoy, would have an opportunity to explore new ways to do things and learn from the other members of that club, committee, or group. If students had to join extracurricular activities, they would be able to make friends and spend time with them each meeting, therefore getting to know them well, feel comfortable talking to them and becoming very good friends. In addition, joining an extracurricular activity is a great way for students to learn the necessary skills that are needed for that specific activity, in case they would want to pursue a career in that area. For example, if a student were to join the student council or debate team, they might have an interest in one day becoming a politician or a lawyer. In conclusion, extracurricular activities are a good way for students to make friends and learn new things that could lead up to a possible career.

Students who must participate in at least one extracurricular activity have something fun to do after the long school day. After school ends, many students must go home to do their homework and help out at home, but making them join an extracurricular activity can let them relax from a stressful day at school, and give them something fun to do that could help them forget the worries of schoolwork and upcoming assessments. From my own experiences, I have enjoyed having something to do and somewhere to go after-school instead of going home and doing homework. I used to play violin in the Generic_Name Youth Orchestra where I enjoyed going to every rehearsal and concert, because it gave me something else to think about, I got to be a part of an amazing "family", and have fun especially after a long day at home or school. In all, having something fun to do after-school, can ease the pressure from school away, allowing students to also enjoy life instead of being under constant stress and pressure from school, classmates, and family issues.

Mandatory extracurricular activities can make students feel "at home", in a particular group. Some students don't always feel like they fit in, and by making them join an extracurricular activity, they could find a place where they are free to open up, talk, and make friends. Having a place where students can be themselves, can give students a boost in self-confidence and morale, which can lead them to be more willing to participate at school and help out at home. Sometimes in life we are confronted by situations and people who can make you feel insignificant and lost, so if students who feel that way were to join an activity they enjoy, it could help them escape from that scary place even if it's just for a little while and help them smile. In conclusion, if all students participated in extracurricular activities, they could feel comfortable for at least some time, before they go back to their daily lives of schoolwork, homework, tests, and family business.

Making extracurricular activities mandatory for all students, is an excellent way for them to get to know each other, learn skills that they could use in the future, whether it's for a career or just for leisure, get to do something they enjoy doing after a long day at school, and give students a chance to express themselves without fear of being left out and ignored. By making every student participate in an extracurricular activity, we can ensure that every student has a place where they will feel protected and have their ideas heard.
