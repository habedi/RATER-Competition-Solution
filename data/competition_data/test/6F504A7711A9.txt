You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because, it would be an amazing experents to do. Luke also saw the world differently after he went nine times. They also saw some amazing things. You get to take care of animals. So if you like taking care of animals you'll like the cattle-boat.

Caring for the animals during the crossing kept Luke busy. It's an amazing opportunity that you'll get to do and have fun while doing it. You would also get to play games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennies tounaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

There are some ups and downs in this journy. You have to leave your family for a few months. Life at sea isn't that easy. When it's raining make sure to be extra careful going up and down the ladders on the boat. You can get hurt or even thrown over board.

In the end it is all worth it. Going on this journy will change on how you look at life. It will make you aware of people of other countries and their needs. It will probably even open up the world to you. So if you sign up or your friend asked you to go with them. Just go because it will will be the time of your life.
