Dear principle,

I think people should do community service if they really want to because you cant force a student to do something that they don't want to do. But in my opinion i think people should do community service at least once or twice a week so we are not destroying earth. Because people don't want to help earth become a better place, then that's how we suffer pollution which is a really bad thing for earth, and community service helps earth stay in good shape and it also keeps earth healthy.

Some people don't want to do it because they think they have more important things to do like make earth even more worse or hang out with friends. But if they could just use 10 minutes of there time to make earth a better place then we wouldn't have to do community service. There are more ways people wouldn't have to do community service and that is to pick up your trash and not litter and that is a really good example for doing community service and not doing it. But people just have to have enough patience to do it, but no, they just don't want to get there hands dirty so that's why they don't want to do it.

But i say we should do community service, but not every day just maybe two times a week so that way people wont cry on how boring it is to do community service. Some people agree with me because they don't want earth to be a bad place. But some don't because they just don't want to do anything because they are lazy. I say that everyone in the school should get outside for five minutes and help clean up so they don't have to whine about how boring it is to take turns cleaning up after each other. But that's my opinion, i think that you should just collect other peoples paper and see who wins these community service crisis.
