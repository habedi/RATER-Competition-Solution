In "The Challange of Exploring Venus," the author supports' his claims on how it is dangerouse it is taking the risk to explore Venus. The author uses various facts, proven by scientests, to justify his explanation. In this he talks about how ships can hover over the planet but not land on it because it is too dangerous. Venuse is too dangerous to explore.

In paragraph 2 the author talks about how Venus is very similar to Earth in looks, but is very dangerous on the inside. He says how Venus's size and density is very close to of Earth. But then he says how all the mission was unmanned because of one reason, which was none of them survied for more than few hours. The text states, "Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survied the landing for more than a few hours."

Another reason that it is dangerous to explore Venus is because it is very hot on the surface and the pressure is too high. The pressure on Venuse is over 90 times higher than here on Earth. The Tempture on Venus in not too less either. It is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The author states, "On the planet's surface, temperatues is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."

Last reason for why Venus is wanting to be explored more is because we do not have a single sample for its surface. Our ships can hover over the planet and gather data of the atmosphere. But the atmosphere is too thick for light to go through. And as said before, the planet is too hot for a ship to last long enough on its surface. The text states, "However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannont penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photagraphy and vidography ineffective."

In Conclusion, our neighbor plant or twin planet Venus is too dangerous for several reasons. The heat and pressure on the planet is too much for our space ship and our boby to handle. Not much can be found out about the planet because of its temperatures and its atmosphere unableing us to take pictures of iis surface form safe distance.
