Yes the use of this technology, facial action coding system can be valuable because if the student are bored or confused the teacher will chang up the lesson. For example when they chang the lesson up they can make it more fun for them and when they are confuse they can slow it down for them and try to help him with it. What this is that more people will pare attention more and will know wants going because it's not boreing. Another thing is when they are confuse they will know how to do it then because the teacher had slow down the lesson and the sturdent will know how to do it then.

Another example is if you are sad they will be a dd that pop up to make you smile if that ad don't work another ad will pop up. What this mean is that this technology can make you happy when you are sad or when you are angry it can make you lagh. So what I am trying to say is that this technolgy can chang the day of your life. This technolgy can help other peolpe out with they life how to tech the lesson and lot more so this will be perfict.
