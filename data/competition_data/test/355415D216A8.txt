There are many reasons why limiting your car usage is good. One of the leading advantages is less pollution. Also, it'll bring you closer with your community. It also leads into less traffic jams and no rush-hours.

Pollution is a big problem in many countries, the U.S.A being one of them. By not driving your car and not releasing your fumes into the air helps to bring less pollution. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog.." When you don't drive your car it not only makes you exercise but filters the air you breathe in by not putting deadly toxins in it.

While not driving your car it brings out the magnificence in your town, because you won't just be looking at it through a car window. "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks" Without the use of your car it makes the cities less denser and better for walking. Many cities who have not been using their cars have brought their stores a walk away instead of being on a highway that isn't accessible by walking.

One of the most difficult things about driving is traffic jams, being stuck in one place for a long time and you can't do anything about it.

All in all, without driving our planet and us would be healthier.       Â
