Everybody loves being with their friends in school, having fun and what not. But then you go home after school and you feel bored and you feel like you aren't doing good in school and you need extra help. If this is you? Then keep reading! Extracurricular activities are things that students can choose to do. Whether it be sports, art, music or even extra help on something. I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities because you'll get better grades, you'll be more busy and productive, and you'll have better relationships with friends.

The first reason I want to talk about is that you'll get better grades. Kids go to school to learn but sometimes they learn something that they don't fully understand. Then their grades start dropping and suddenly then aren't doing too good. But if you stay in extracurricular activities, you'll get extra help with things you don't understand and in return, you'll get all A's. Even with something like sports or music. They both help you get smarter and help you be more productive which leads to doing good in school.

My second reason is that being in extracurricular activities helps you be more busy and productive. being in extracurricular activities helps a lot with being productive. Mostly, when you are at home, you aren't doing anything productive. Your just being on your phone or playing video gomes. But with staying after school, you'll make better use of your time which helps you to not only waste your time, but also helps you to do good in school.

Now, my third and final reason is that you'll have a better relationship with friends. Now, one of the main reasons why kids stay after school is obviously to see their friends. And thats actually a really good reason as to why students should stay after school. you'd have better relationships with your friends and even make new friends if you stayed after. you'd be able to see your friends more and spend more time with them.

So to wrap things up, I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities after school. Getting good grades, being more productive, and having better relationships with friends are hopefully all good reasons that make you want to stay after the final bell. So after reading all the way through. Did this change your mind?
