Cell Phones Policy

Dear principal,

I think that all students should be able to use their phones when allowed. Like this students will get less distracted and pay more attention to the teacher because they know that they will have time to use it! Also think about this kids will get more passing grades because they will get less distracted in their classes but that's if we are allowed to use our phones on our free times or in our lunch. We should also have the ability to use our iPods or electronics what ever we have as long as it's safe.

We can pay more attention and if our phones, or iPods get stolen then that will be our own responsibility because ewe are the ones that want to bring and use. We should totally have the right to do it and like this teacher would get us less in trouble! I think that this will be the best solution for kids getting their phones taken away from teacher or any electronic that you might have. And I don't think that this could hurt someone or something why cant we have the right to be able to use our phones in our free time we got nothing else to do so we might as well do it on something that we like. When classes start and we will follow the rule of keeping them turned off. And if not we you teachers should just take them away and have a parent call school and get it back. I think that almost all students might agree with me and keep phones out during class.

Just let us have the right to have our cell phones out and use them in our free time. Than just teacher taking them away because they are using them in class. I think that will help teacher a lot of sending phones to the office and it will be much better if we could do that and not hide our phones or what ever you may have. We should have the right to use our phones during our free time or lunch periods.
