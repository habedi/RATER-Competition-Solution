The best policy, in my opinion, would be the first policy, or policy one.

That is the best policy to choose because the students will bring their cell phones to school anyways even if you choose policy two.

The students will not be using them as often if the first policy is chosen, because most people at our school work differently.

They are told they can bring cell phones, they won't bring them.

When they are told they can't bring cell phones, they will bring cell phones and won't care if it is taken up in class because they are texting when phones aren't allowed at all.

They will try to text in the bathroom and call their parents or their friends when they are in the bathroom, but this could be avoided if the bathrooms had speakers in them where the office could hear everything that is going on, so they could also hear about fights and then they would be able to break it up and know exactly who started it.

The students would be able to use their phones during their lunch period and during other breaks, and they would be happy with that.

They would be texting their parents during the lunch period to tell them if they feel sick or texting their friends, asking them what they are doing after school.

This would especially help the kids in high school, who go out partying with their friends after school, so they can ask their friends what they are doing after school and if they want to go party at the usual place they can go partying at.

When they can use their cell phones during their lunch period, they will ask their girlfriend or just their regular friends what they are doing after school and if they wanted to go for a walk, go eat in various places, or if they wanted to go see a movie.

If they said that they did want to go somewhere, they can decide through texting rather than going to sit across the room just to ask them one thing and deciding where to go, which could take the whole time.

If the policy is changed, there would need to be a couple of changes made, such as speakers in the bathrooms, so the office could hear what was going on, whether it is someone texting their parents, calling their parents, calling their friends, or texting their friends, which would possibly get them in trouble if their cell phone was on vibrate or they had their volume set anywhere from one through seven, which the usual volume is seven on anyone's phone, even if they are in school and know that they can get in trouble.

This can happen anytime during the day except at lunch period, which is everyone's favorite time to use a cell phone.

There are also exceptions to when they can bring their cell phone to school.

For example, they shouldn't be allowed to bring their cell phone to school during MCT testing time.

There are ways to make sure that they don't have one during this test.

You can make a phone call that goes out to every student in the classroom, and if a phone rings you can take it up and give it back to them after the test is over.

Then the student will know that they are not allowed to bring their cell phone to school during MCT testing time.

There are also ways to make sure that a student doesn't have their cell phone on during class time.

You can make periodic calls that go out to every student in the building, and if their cell phone rings they can be informed that they must turn it off.

The periodic checks can be made every 30 minutes.

When a student's cell phone rings more than once, then their phone must be taken up, and they should get a referral from the office for in-school detention, or, possibly however many times it rang, out-of-school detention.

When this happens, they must be informed that only their parent can pick up the cell phone, and only during a certain time of the day.
