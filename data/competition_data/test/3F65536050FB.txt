The face on mars could not be an alien monument. You may argue that it was made by an ancient civilization, how would they know we had a lower resolution camera on the orbiting to make it in a way that the shadows would produce a face. Even on a cloudy day, the high resolution images of the martian mesa did not look like a face any more.

The details showen proves the fact that it is a natural land form simular to the ones ones on earth. Jim Garvin stated,"It reminds me most of middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."

Useing his rule of thumb, the higher resolution shows more details of the face. So if there is aliens, how come we dont even see evidence of buildings around them? If it was built, a monument like that would have take time to build. In turn liveing accomadations would be needed for the workers and the pictures show none.

Although you may beleve that there is life on mars, please acumulate more proof before saying that it is a fact. This universe is big and yes it is possible because the universe is so big but there is no proof that there is life on mars. I hope this would sway your thoughts.
