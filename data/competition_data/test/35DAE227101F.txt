How you ever been in a traffic jam? Where you find yourself late for work and overly stressed and tensed. This leads many people in thinking of a life without cars, of a place where loud honking and angry people aren't the norm. Well in places like Vauban, Germany peole have decide to smear the lines of the ideal suburban community by banning cars in the district.

The term "car free" zone never got more realistic then the streets of Vauban, where more than 70 percent of people have given up the tradition of owning a car. According to "In German suburbs, life goes on without cars" many people see this new way of life extermly effective. "When I had a car I was always tensed", states Heidrun Walters. Heidrun is a local from Vauban who found herself happier walking around then being behind a vehicle. Residents in Vauban believe that bicycling and walking are more effective for themselves and the enviroment. This leaves the question on how cars are able to be used in a district like Vauban; where ther are no garages, street parking, or driveways. Even though there are few car owners in the district you can buy a car space for 40,000.

Although Vauban bans cars for the sheer annoyance ot them, other places like Paris have a more enviromental issue with cars. In Paris, the amount of smog has became so outrages officials have given ciztens in the parisian streets a temporary ban to help clear the air of pollution. Many drivers felt that this ban was unfair and discouraging, so up to 4,000 ciztens were fined for using there car. Since Ftrance is a Diesel fuel community, researchs are blaming the diesel for the smog problems. Even though the difference for the use of diesel more than gas can be the problem, who to say that the smog will stay gone?

Some countries have taken to this new trend of no cars and make a day out of it. Such as Bogata, Colombia has speard the idea throughout South America- causing milions to travel by walking and using bicycles. The main idea of this program is to promote alternate transportation and reduce fog, says the article "Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogato". The turnout for this day was so large two other Colombian cities joined in. "It's a good opptunity to take away stress and lower pollution", said local businessman Carlos Arturo who joined and rode a two seated bicycle with his wife. The ethusiastic outcome made on lookers from other countries stare with awe.

America, who's ciztens are known for driving expensive cars has begun to broaden it's fews on the ideal Utopia. According to "The End of Car Culture", many Americans have been buying less and less cars as  the years progress.  Some of this new rrefinery stems from the recession, when many people couldn't afford a brand new car. Sociologist believe America is taking a permnant shift in it's cultural stand point. Along with pop cultures help, reseachers believe that it allows people to be more connected without driving to meeting their friends. This only futher shows that the worlds outlook on life has opened to new and intresting ways.

Whether it's giving up cars all together, or having a national day dedicated. People all around the world have began to look at new and improved way of living. Some countries are even becoming inspired by others who have found that a more car conservative life can be better, and places like Paris have seen that without cars their enviroment could be a lot more cleaner and effective.
