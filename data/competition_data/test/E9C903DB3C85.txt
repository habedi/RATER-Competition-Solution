I think we all can agree that driving is an important part of life. Driving is what gets us from point a to point b. We drive vehicles on a day to day basis. It's what gets us to and from our jobs. The downside to driving is that it is becoming unsafe. There are so many people in the world that dive cars and own cell phones. The population is growing which means more and more cars are hitting the road every day. So, the question is, how can we make driving safer?

New laws are being created on cell phones and driving. One of the familiar changes is that now you can't be touching your phone at all while driving and it can't be in your lap when driving. Some say they don't like this new law because it means they can't check their phones for emergencies. The law didn't say you couldn't keep it in the car or their glove department. So basically, that problem is solved. I think this Law is fine how it is and that it is a good law to cut down on cell phones and driving. People shouldn't be able to see their phone while driving. It should be somewhere in the car out of their eyesight. That way they won't be tempted to text while driving.

Texting and driving can get both people killed that crash into each other.

You could be driving and doing nothing wrong while another person is texting and driving not paying attention to the road and they could end up ending your life.

Texting is not the only problem with having a cell phone on you when you are in a car. Some people say they use their phone for navigation. This could also be a distraction. Many phone companies have touched down on this problem. In fact, the newer model phones now can speak the directions to you while you're driving. That way you won't have to look down at your phone.

People often like to bring up that sometimes they get important calls while driving. There's also a solution to this problem to. When you are receiving a call, you can pull over to the nearest stop and then receive the call. People then like to ask what if you are on the interstate. There is no law that says you can't pull over to the side and make or receive the phone call. So, yea you should be able to use your phones while driving but keep note there is a right and wrong way of doing this. If you need to use it and you just happen to be driving, please use these techniques to drive safer.
