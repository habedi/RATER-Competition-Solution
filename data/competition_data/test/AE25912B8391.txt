Dear principle,

I think this idea will encourage students to do better in their subjects because in all my years of being a student i have notice many students always excited saying please bell ring now but i was confused i didn't know why he wanted the bell to ring so badly so i check my schedule and i notice that it said gym 4th and 5th period and that's when i understand why he was so excited to leave.

Also i have noticed that some students don't care when teachers say they will fail that specific subject if they don't do the work but most students find it funny and laugh and others just say i don't care but when that day comes there always crying saying they don't want to go to summer school which was annoying at times because they specifically knew what they were doing and that they were gonna get punished sooner or later so why pretend you didn't know.

So basically what im trying to explain to you is that almost the whole school likes gym besides people who don't like to participate in the activities so if you always take gym from students who have C average they will probably work hard to change there grade but may not succeed this goal and will end up hating the school for the rest of the year which also a bad thing because they will probably end up getting a lower grade average but its their faults in the first place for not taking school seriously.
