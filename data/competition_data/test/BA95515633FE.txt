Car usage has decreased more and more as the years have gone on. Numerous people have found other ways of transportation rather than driving a car everywhere they went. The decrease in car usage has been very beneficial to the enviornment and continues to do so.

With the decrease in car usage, a suburban community called, "Vauban" in Germany has mostly been named "car-free." Their reasoning for their lack of car usage is because most of their citizens decided to give up their cars to live a better lifestyle. Its an easy solution because stores are placed just a walk away and as a result many people are commuting by bicycle or by walking. In Paris, France the city banned driving during smog to clear the polluted air in the city. To enforce this, the police would fine about 22 euros to anyone driving during the partial ban.

Bogota, Colombia has started a program called, "Car-free day" where most citizens will use another source of transportation like hiking, biking, or even taking buses to limit the amount of pollution for the day. Even rainfall has not stopped people from participating and broken sidewalks have been repaired and rush-hour restrictions have limited traffic. In the United States ''recent studies have shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." Studies have also shown that the number of miles driven in America have dropped since 2005.  Driving by young people has also decreased between 2001 and 2009.

All in all, car usage has decreased tremendously in the past years and continues to decrease. Many countries have taken action to limit the amount of air pollution and it has benefited the enviornment.
