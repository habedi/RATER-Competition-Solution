Everyone loves summer. This is because of the weather, how the environment becomes and also people get the opportunity to explore more things during this season. During Summer, students are given some months off for vacation. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to ensure they continue learning during their break and this should be teacher based not student based. Although some may think otherwise, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know more than students, teachers are also seen as parents in school so it is their responsibility to guide students and also, teacher designed projects helps students to use time productively.

To begin, teachers know more than students. For example, teachers go to college or training institutions to be shaped to become who they are. They learn a lot from their schooling process. A teacher once said, " A teenager has been a child before but has not been an adult yet". This shows that teachers have more experience and knowledge so they have the responsibility to give students assignments and projects because they know best and they have been students before.

To continue,Teachers are also seen as parents to students. In school, because students are away from home, they may have certain things they would like to discuss with an elderly person. Who may they as? There is no doubt that the students will discuss with their teachers for help. This shows that a student will always need help from a teacher. Also the same way students go to help from teachers, it is the work of the teachers to give students assignments and projects. All these reveal the essence of summer projects being teacher based or designed.

Moreover, Summer projects being teacher-designed helps the student to use time productively. Imagine students creating their own projects for summer. Do you think it will be of any importance to them? Well, there is no way it will be. This is because, if students create or design their own projects, they may do it anyhow because they are not given any guidelines to follow to make a good project. Students may even get distracted because it is vacation and this may lead to procrastination. If a teacher designed a project for students, they would take it seriously because the teacher is their leader and parent in school so they follow instructions given by the teacher in order to be graded or rewarded for the good work done. Students will succeed if they follow instructions of a teacher than to rely on their own means.

To conclude, there is a huge contrast between a student-designed and a teacher-designed project. Teacher-designed projects are more likely to make students successful and also they learn to use time wisely and productively. This will prepare them for the future to become better individuals. I agree that summer projects should be teacher-designed.
