Dear principle

I believe that the first policy is the better one to allow. I think that the first policy is better because kids should be able to have there phones just in case of emergency. I also think kids should have there phones because if your at lunch you should be able to use you're phone. And the last reason i think the first policy is better is because you can yous them for math.

The first reason think you should be able to have your phone in school is in case of and emergency. For example if you have to catch the bus home. Another example is if you have to go to a friends house. And lastly is because your parents might need to contact you.

My second reason i think that the first policy is better is because if your going to be at lunch or free time your not going to be doing any work. For example you can play a game on your phone. Another example is you can text your friends that might be on the other side of the lunch room. And the last example is so that you can make a phone call

The last reason that i think that the first policy is better is because you could use them use them for math. For example if you need to use the calculator. Another example is so that you can put you notes that you take in class and put them in your phone. The last example is so that you can play with is when your done your test.

As you can see i clearly believe that the first policy is better than the second policy.
