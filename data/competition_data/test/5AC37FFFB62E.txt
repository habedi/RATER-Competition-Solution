Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing you on behalf of the students at SCHOOL_NAME

about the new cell phone policies that you are considering:

Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.

Although I realize that Policy 2 has some benefits of its own I ask you to strongly consider Policy 1. Policy 1 you would only approve if you knew that you could trust us. So if you don't not approve that plan are you saying that you don't trust the kids at your school. That would only reflect badly upon you.

My second reason that you should allow kids to have phones at school would be because children should be learning by now that they should know when and when not it is appropriate to use cell phones. Allowing them never to learn this skill will only result in a future problem of our generation getting fired because they do not know when it is appropriate to take out there cell phone.

My third and final reason is that some parents after school forget to pick up there kids so the child needs some way of reaching them so that they are not forgotten. After all no school wants kids roaming around it 3 hours after school has ended because some parent forgot to pick up there kids.

When you are deciding iI hope you take my reasons into consideration.

Sincerely,
