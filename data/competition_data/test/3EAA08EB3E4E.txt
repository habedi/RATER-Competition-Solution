School days can be a drag at times, and can cause a lack of interest and become unmotivated in school. Then at the end of every school day, most of us go home to relax from the day we went through, but sometimes going home to the same old routine can become boring. However, the principal announcing that every student should take an extracurricular activity sounds like a great solution to this, because these activities will allow students to interact with others, introduce students to be able to learn new skill sets, and give students a chance to participate in activities they love.

One reason that the principal's decision is a good idea is because this will allow students to interact with each other more often. Sure, we do that everyday during school, but if you were to join a club or group, it would be a great opportunity to make new friends. Since you would be choosing a group based on your interests instead of attending a common subject, this would mean that others in your group would share the same interests as you, which is great for connecting with others. For example, when I was in a little soccer league, I was able to talk and play with others while knowing that they liked the same things that I did, which made me feel included and a part of the team. Being able to interact with others also allow for the improvement of social and teamwork skills. Playing in a sport is a good example of this because of how teammates cooperate with each other to reach their goal and win the game. It can be fun during games when you pass the ball to each other before shooting a goal, making making the whole team know that they all made a big contribution during the game.

Another reason that having a required extracurricular is a good idea is how they can give students a chance to find new hobbies and skills. Whatever extracurricular you choose can introduce you to a skill set based off your liking. Say if someone were interested technology, computers, robots and such. They could join a coding or engineering club, which could become an new hobby for themselves. This can also apply to choosing activities out of someone's comfort zone. Students that choose to join groups out of their average liking can lead to the development of a new hobby that they never knew they had. Once when I had to stay after school to attend a concert, so I had to take an activity in the meantime. One of the only choices available was a social study group, which I needed at the time. It turned out to be a pleasant experience while working with others. Gaining new hobbies from extracurricular activities can also skills to help students find what they're going to do in the future. Like if someone were interested in wildlife or animals. That person could join a wildlife conservation group or an awareness group of some sort, so they could be involved with the thing they love and be introduced to a new skill that can also be beneficial in their community and even in their future.

A third reason for why required extracurricular activities are a good idea is that they can allow students to enjoy themselves. Students know how it feels to have to lag through every school day, as well as having to worry about their grades and piling school work. Being in an extracurricular can take your mind off of school in the moments you're in that group, and let you enjoy the time you spend there instead of having to stress yourself out more than you can handle. And, as previously stated, you'll be able to spend time with other students who know what it's like to face unmotivated times in school, home, or any other place. They can all talk to each other and do what interests them while even learning about topics without having piles of work to do afterwards, like in a coding club. And you'll be able to relax more often, or at the very least do what you think is fun. Like make arts and crafts, make or play games, play a sport, help the environment. Whatever you enjoy doing, there's most likely a club just for that. Something that you and any other student can enjoy.

Having to take a required extracurricular activity doesn't seem as bad when you think about it. You're able to be with and connect with others, discover new activities that you didn't even know you would enjoy, and take your mind off of the stressful events going on and enjoy yourself. So if you like the sound of that, then having an extracurricular seems like a great idea that you can give a chance.
