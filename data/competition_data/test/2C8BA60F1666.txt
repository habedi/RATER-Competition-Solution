Want to take advantage of your life? Try new things, overcome things you thought you'd never pass, or maybe you felt incapable of doing a physical sport? I feel like participating in at least 1 extracurricular activity should be needed to learn more about yourself and others. Here's why:

You could learn new things. Maybe you had stage fright or you thought you might be lacking some acting skills, but you try out anyways. You join drama and meet many new people, you tell them about your stage fright and they tell you ways on how they deal with it. You now feel good and you find Drama way more easier. You then audition for the main character, which many, many people tried out for. A week goes by and the teacher is ready to announce who is the main character. You made it! People might usually think that they'll be bad at doing something they're are new too, but you never know, if you never try. Who knows maybe one day in the future someone may ask you to act for their movie, and since you have that knowledge from before, you could be a new celebrity. For example one time I tried out for soccer, thinking I would be terrible at it and I would never be drafted, but soon after, I got in. And I was actually one of the best players in my team.

My second reason is that you could meet many new people. Who knows really. Maybe if you participate in an art club, you could meet your future best friend, but if you never try it out, you'll never know. You could meet people that are an expert in a certain topic, for example you met someone who is super good at building, maybe in the future if you're not sure on how to build something and need help, you could call them and they could help you for free, instead of paying a carpenter. If more and more people are needed to participate in extracurricular activities, there would be less introverted people, who feel isolated from the community.

I really do agree with the principle on this new rule. This could really show a positive impact to kids, mentally and physically. There are many people who are too lazy to do any extracurricular activities, but with this new rule, it could really make a difference with themselves physically. Maybe if they joined and played football or soccer, it could really help him be more physically active. There are some people who feel depressed and lonely. They feel like no one cares about them and that they're not needed in anyones life. Maybe if they participate in something they could meet new people and they could have new friends. Their friends would care about them and make them feel more happy instead of lonely. People could even turn into the complete opposite and be a lot more social than they where before. More people will have a positive mindset on things and more people could be more energetic, which could lead to healthier people, better grades, more participation, a healthy community, and a lot more.

The real reason on why I feel like this is a good rule though, is because you just need to take advantage of your life. Try new things everyday. If things don't workout or if you're not too good at something, oh well. At least you know now and at least you tried it out. The more you know now, the more you'll be able to do things for yourself in the future, and really, you will thank yourself. You could have a really bright future if you know how to do a variety of things. This is why I feel like the principle came up with an excellent idea and that it should definitely be applied to the school.
