Imagine you're the teacher. You're explaining the scientific method to your students, hoping that you can answer all of their questions before tomorrow's big exam. You turn toward the white board and suddenly you hear 3 soft beeps. You turn to find 3 of your students hiding cell phones behind their textbooks, carelessly texting away. If cell phones are allowed at school, this could become a daily routine. Even if the rules are to shut all phones off during class periods and only use them at lunch or free time, students can be careless and forgetful. They can sincerely forget to take their device out of their pocket, or try their best to keep it hidden. If cell phones are banned, you will see higher test and homework results, more respect, and more interaction between students.

Obviously, the student is not paying much attention at all if he/she is using their phone. This distraction can take away from important information that is needed to complete their assignments. If the students are phone-free, there is a bigger chance that they are listening to what is being said. Therefore, when it's time for them to accomplish a homework assignment or a test, the student will remember what he/she learned and will be able to apply that to the task. More attentiveness in class, more right answers.

Sometimes, teachers can bring up something relative or interesting to the students. This causes the students to respect the teacher more than they had before. When a student knows that a teacher is kind, funny, or can relate to themselves, it causes a positive, more respectful relationship. When a phone takes away from the teacher's intriguing knowledge, it can take away from the chance that that student might start to enjoy learning and being in that subject.

Nowadays, all kids do is text. Instead of actually discussing a subject face to face, they abbreviate words and sentences and send each other messages. If there are no phones in school, students can't text. This way, if they hear something interesting during a class period, students can discuss it face to face. They can even decide to call one another and plan to study or complete a project together. This not only increases the effort in student's work, but it increases the actual relationship of two friends.

As you can see, students will eventually start to realize that no phones is a positive impact on their lives. Making phone use in school against the rules will help a lot more than you and the students might have thought.
