Dear Principal,

I ,as a SCHOOL_NAME Student, think that having community work should be required. Community work will help not just the community but will also help your self. Doing a little help for the community is not something that should just be thought of as not important. It should be something that people like to do, I mean its your community the place were you live, why wouldn't you want your city to look as great as any other place.

Being a student here makes me proud to be who I am. Helping the community out is nothing to pay for just being here at this school. Without a community this school would not be here, even if it was no one wants to go to some dirty and totally nasty school. Why would you want that, when if every one helps out for just a little while your community would look great and then every one would want to go to your school or your community to live in, meaning more jobs, more money, and more families.

Now I can see why someone would say, "Help out the community, why would I do that. I have better things to do. That's why they have jobs to clean the city." Well that is true, but I say that if no one was to help the community why would any one want to come to a place were every is to lazy to help out the community. Which in turn will have people, say like your neighbor, who will need your help with something like putting up Christmas lights up, and you might just say no and say to hire someone to do it for you. The community is a place of friends and families growing up together, not fighting each other.

This is why I, STUDENT_NAME, say that the principle should have community service required. This is something that keeps the community together, friends who work together for a very happy community!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME (SCHOOL_NAME)
