Phones and Driving

Phones an everyday distraction in life. They distract us from work and many other things. But none as bad as when you're driving. Many people die because of people looking down at their phones whale their driving. It kills on average of 10% of people 15 and up out of all the deaths from age all the way to being shot. 10% is a large number of people who died from these electronics so I belive there is a way to make it a smaller number.

* Turning off your phone when you get in your car.

* Putting your phone in the back seat so you would have to make a stop get out and open the back door to grab your phone.

* Put your phone on the none setting so it won't vibrate or ring when you're driving.

* Have your passenger use your phone for you.

* Get more police on patrol and get them to watch for people driving and using their phones and if they find one give them a ticket and a court date.

If we follow these simple guidelines and one rule then the cause of death from using a phone and driving will drop. In my eyes I believe that the cause of deaths by this will at least half or maybe even more. This will cause people to feel safer to leave their house. This will also cause more people to go outside for walks meaning less people sitting in their house eating and only gaining to much weight. So, this will make the whole world a better safer place to be.
