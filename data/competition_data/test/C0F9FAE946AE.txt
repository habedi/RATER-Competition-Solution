Students, if given the chance, would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. A large portion of kids all over the world struggle to go to school because of various scenarios and responsibilities that prevent them from going to school. Whether the problem be a disability, large distances, a dangerous environment, or problems in their own life, people may need a method of education that can work anywhere and anytime.

Many students may live in areas where technology is scarce or has a lack of constructed buildings, so their designated school may be far away from their house. This leaves them with two traveling opportunities: take transportation or go by foot. In many cases, though, these places tend to not have any metros, roads, or even have anything like bikes to ride. This changes the choice to "Should I go, or should I not?", as it may well not even be worth it to traverse to their destination for hours just to walk back afterwards. If we were to start having online classes, they would be able to communicate with their teachers efficiently as long as they had electronics.

For those who are severely injured, or quarantined in their room from being sick, they're likely to be stuck at home as a means of preventing the reopening of wounds or getting others at school sick. With the help of technology, they can still attend their classes without falling behind on late work they would have missed out on without worrying that they might spread their disease or put themselves in risk of getting injured again. Even if it's not a disability that keeps them away from school, there may be family responsibilities, especially for those in the poorer classes. These responsibilities may range from helping their family business, taking care of their younger siblings, doing all of the house work to relief stress for their parents, or any family member being in the hospital, these can be random and often times sporadic for those who struggle in terms of income. These are usually resposibilities they cannot say no to, and so being able to take classes via the internet allows them to multitask and not have to give up their education.

Most people believe, however, that those who want online classes are just using it as an excuse to be lazy, or so that they may slack off without the teacher seeing. While they may be true for some, the danger is real. Even if school is maybe a ten or so minute walk, or you have a bus stop nearby, parents have realized that in that short amount of time, you may get lost or attacked. Cities are a prime example of a dangerous environment for children and teens alike. Thee may be a lot of dark alleyways or corners on a student's route to school, and they can early be robbed or kidnapped at each turn. There has also been an influx of school shootings, in which people would rather stay in the safety of their own home than go to school. During extreme weather and natural disasters, school chooses to cancel school or have an early dismissal so that the students arent endangered, which wouldn't be a problem if we had our classes online instead. With online classes, students would be able to ask questions during the weekend, or while caved in by a snowstorm.

When looking at a small scale, like a single county or school, it may look like everyone's attending and keeping up with their grades, but when looked upon at a larger scale, like other states and even countries, it's obvious that there's a huge problem. Many people worldwide decide whether they like it or not, that they do not have the time or means to go to school everyday, which comes back to haunt them in the future when they go looking for a job. With the support of online classes and video conferencing, we could provide everyone with a solution to this dilemma.
