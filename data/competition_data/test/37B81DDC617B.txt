The value of using this technology to read students' emotional expression is correct because you never know what's going on in their life. Humans have some kind of challenges they might face.

This technology will help them see who they really are and how they can change their emotions. Us as humans have to figure out what's best for us in the long run. We have to speak up if anyone is down or fustrated. In this life we live in we need to check on our peers and other people.

Emotional Expressions have different characterstics toward people. Being upset, having fear,angry, disgusted, suprised,and having happiness is all diferent expressions people face. You can also have movements in your expressions with people. Seeing people have those emotions know something maybe wrong or they are really excited.

Having different moods works for this techonology because it can tell us what's really wrong with us. Different attitudes can also be helped in this technology. This FACS (Facial Action Coding System) would work out for anyone that really need help.
