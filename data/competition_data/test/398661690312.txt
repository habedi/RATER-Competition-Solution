Imagine you're a middle schooler that has a lot to get done everyday and, have to take care of your sibling, maybe even take care of the house. This is the case for a lot of student's, which is why I disagree that student's should have to at least be in one extracurricular activity.

A reason why I disagree that with extracurricular activities being forced is that we have a lot of homework to get done because we're beginning to take the SOL's and, we're preparing for high school next year.

Another reason why I'm against student's having to take extracurricular activities unwillingly is that some student's don't enjoy any of the activities that the school has to offer, for example, I personally don't like any extracurricular actives or at least at the moment.

My final reason why I believe student's shouldn't have to be forced to participate in extracurricular activities is that student's may already be in a activity that isn't school related for example, Karate or the "SYA".

In conclusion, I disagree strongly with the decision that student should be in at least one extracurricular activity. It should be a choice if the student want's to join activity or not because in this period of time, we're very busy and have a lot of thing's going on in our life's at the moment. What would you do is this situation, would you voice your opinion and try to change the situation or would you go along with your principal's decision of making you join a extracurricular activity?
