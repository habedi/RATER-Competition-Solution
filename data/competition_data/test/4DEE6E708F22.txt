I argue in favor of changing the Electoral College, to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Everyone should be allowed to vote ,on the person they want them to run the Presidency. Instead of only having 34 Democratic as the a state's voters. That way the President gets the votes that he or she desevers. They should jsut let anyone choose who the want ,having the states with diffferent opinons.

In my opinon,I think that all states representatives should have the same amount of people in the house of representatives. I don't find it fair that some states have 500,000 voters and others 35 million voters. In that case just let one state vote on who should be the next president. Let everyone vote on who they want, on whom they feel like it's the right person. Not everyopne thinks the same , not everyone believes in the same things as everyone else. Butwith the Electoral College they are not ,let the people vote on what they want in most states, for an example Texas. In Texas they only have 34 voters taht will vote on the person they were sent to vote on. Sometimes the voter would get confused and vote on the opisite person or they would just vote on who they wanted to vote on in the fisrt place.
