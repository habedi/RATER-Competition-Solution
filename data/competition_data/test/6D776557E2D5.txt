Throughout the world, there are multiple young influencers trying to complete their school career while attending their everyday jobs. Many people watch these young actors on TV shows, movies, and social media, and see the positive aspects of their lives. However, most people do not see the stress that lies on their shoulders. For instance, many young actors and actresses have the heavy stress of becoming fantastic role models, attending activities, and finishing school all at the same time. However, having access to online school allows them to have more freedom to create new memories and have less stress in the future. Without online school, many young actors would not be able to participate in movies, so plots of movies and shows would not be as entertaining for the kids on the other side of the screen. Taking online courses at home allows all students to become more focused on their present and future; as well as, gaining more experiences. Although many people believe students should not be allowed to take online courses because they might not understand the work provided for them, students should have access to classes online or video conferences at home due to participating in more extracurricular activities, having more one on one learning experiences, and preventing bad decisions.

Some families like to take multiple vacations a year, and online courses can help those students from falling behind on the work needed to graduate. Furthermore, many teenage social media stars are beginning to have more opportunities in other parts of the world. For instance, someone who lives in Virginia might not receive that same opportunities as someone living in California, so the online courses will allow students to maintain their grades, and gain oppourtunities. Lastly, many students would be allowed to have a job outside of school. Many students drop out of high school because they need to help earn money for their family to survive.

Furthermore, taking classes at home allows students to have more learning opportunities with their teachers. For instance, many students learn differently, and may not be receiving the amount of help they need to become successful. Some students might learn better with hands on activities; however, others might memorize better by taking notes and listening to the teacher lecture them. Online conferences can help students learn in their own specific way. In addition, online courses might help students become more focused. Usually, there are multiple classroom distractions that can prohibit students from receiving the information they need.

In many schools, classrooms can get out of control, and can cause students to feel unprepared for their assignments in the future. Students should be allowed to take online classes because it create new learning experiences.

Online school stops students from making choices they might regret in the future.

If students were not granted the right to take these classes, then some people might become too stressed, and they might not recieve the experiences the need for the future. Schools all around the world should let students begin to take online courses and conferences at home.
