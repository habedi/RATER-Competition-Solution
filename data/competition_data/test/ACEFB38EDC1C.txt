The principal sees how much kids love to do activities all the time during class. Mr. Generic_Name the principal decides to make everyone join at least one extracurricular activity. I do agree with him well you see this would help them see what great skills they have,how healthy they're gonna be,and how they could become more social with unknown students in their school,keep their mind from technology.

There was a little girl named Generic_Name she was listing to "Earthworm Sally Theme Song." on YouTube then when got to class and listened to the morning news the principal announced "I have decided that all students of Generic_School must participate in at least one extracurricular activity."Generic_Name didn't know which extracurricular activity. she would pick, so right after class she went to go look at the listen and signed up for music thinking she would only be listing to music. When she got there she had to find a song and sing it for their first day and Generic_Name never thought it was going to be like this so she looked for a song and decided that she was gonna sing "Someone Like You" from Adele. So Mr. Generic_Name went up to Generic_Name and asked her to sing and she sang her voice was amazing and she never knew how good she could do until now. She became a singer when she grew up and was successful.

Generic_Name had a friend named Generic_Name he was lazy he didn't do much work in his classes or at home he was also very unhealthy and over weight. Then he also heard about the new and he was to lazy to sign the paper so he decided he wasn't gonna join any extracurricular activity so when he saw the sign up sheet the next day while going to math he saw that someone signed his name up for soccer and he knew it was Generic_Name and they had to meet after school that Tuesday but he had no plans so he carried along with his day. Later he went to the soccer club and he did everything and realized how much fun it was to actually try something and he became more healthy,and tall,along with buffer and stronger and had the right weight for his age.

There was a girl named Generic_Name she had Anxiety so she didn't talk a lot she barely talked almost her whole family forgot how her voiced sounded like! Then the same thing happened she heard the news and joined the SCA to help the community. She talked yes but with only the teacher then they had a project to say what they wanna do to help the world or what they're more concerned about in the world so she did her's on Global Warming and said a wonderful speech to her member and she talked to them more often and started talking to her family more and other people in school by waving and saying "Good Morning." Or "Hello." She was a great person and got rid of her anxiety by an extracurricular activity.

Generic_Name had an addiction to his phone like almost everyone else and couldn't stop using it and sneaked it in class and used it. He used it to listen to music in the shower used it to eat to use the toilet etc. He heard the new about the extracurricular activities and he decided to join the gaming club but it was full so he joined strings and he actually payed attention and played the violin the best he could he used his phone for less than an hour and played the violin more thanks to the club his eyes can rest and his bring will be working better than it used to when he used his phone now he's doing great in class and trying even though its hard for him he still tries his very best and works really hard it's a big change and have to take a lot of baby steps but he's doing greater than ever and will become great.

Well you see yes some people might disagree with me because they might not want to join any of the clubs because they don't like running and might not be good at it. Just because they don't like running doesn't mean anything sports aren't the only extracurricular activity there and if they aren't good at it doesn't mean at least trying is going to kill them or they can another club or maybe make one up with their friends so they can be in that club but they are gonna have to think hard and make sure the principal agrees with their club. See some people might say it's boring well that's only true when you think that and don't try but when you feel welcomed and try it'll be fun you might even make some new friends you never know. Extracurricular activities aren't just for being good at it they are for having fun and you might become famous or become history thanks to this club you joined. These clubs can change you life but it takes effort and not just do it and done no it takes time and a lot of learning remember this quote "All things are difficult before they are easy." So every time you have a difficult time trying to solve something try to do it step by step or in other words "In life their is never an elevator always take the steps."

I hope after reading all this you agreed with me if you already did great but if you didn't I hope you do now and if you still don't agree then your loss.
