Dear Principal,

I think that changing the grade C average to a grade B average is not a good idea because most students have a grade C average and they would not get to play sports. Also students wont be able to participate in any other after school activities like the Drama Club. So if they change the grade point average most students wont be able to play sports or be in any other school activity. Also they may not have that many people on a team to play sports because a lot of sports need a lot of players on their team like baseball or football.

So why would you want to change the school policy to a higher grade point average when children are already struggling with the original grade average? In my opinion your just keeping students from doing what they love. I know i would not like being told that I couldn't be in a sport or activity because of my grade average wasn't high enough when I am trying my hardest to keep it up to where its at. That would be very disappointing to me when I am struggling to keep my grades up and all of sudden I cant be in a certain sport or activity I really want to be in. So before you decide to change the grade average think about how students are going to feel and how they are going to react to it. I can guarantee they will not like it all. Thank you for your time and please think about your decision before you make one.

Your fellow student,
