Dear Principal,

I disagree with your new train of thought. I believe we should be able to at least have a C average in our classes to participate in after school activities. It can be hard for us to keep a B all the time, trust me I know. I have wanted to participate in activity myself. If

I have a C I will not be able to do so. I have an extremely hard high school credit class and I can't seem to get my grade up.

The C average on the grading scale is technically still passing so there for if I have a C it would not be necessarily a bad thing. Yes, it is difficult for a teacher to teach a student who purposely gets a C to pass but at least you're getting them to do the work expected of them. Normally the student in sports have a great background right?

One slip and they get kicked off the team . Do you find that completely fare? I would appreciate it if you rethought this for our sake.

I have a hard teacher and I hardly understand his material sometimes. We receive hard tasks, and sometimes an overload of homework. when I sit in his class while taking notes I do not understand some of the words he is using. It can be difficult and sometimes I wish I had a dictionary to carry around for his class. I know I wouldn't keep a B very long in this class

My point is, when I am sitting in class trying my hardest to reach your expectations think about how hard I'm trying. Remember how difficult it is for me to do well in this class. I know just my note alone will not convince you. Perhaps mine along with other students might though. Thank you for you time and I hope I have helped my piers in some way.
