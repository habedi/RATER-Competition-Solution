We live in a modern era where screens and technology are everywhere, but school can be an escape from all of those for many students. Students would not benefit from attending classes through online video conferencing. This is because looking at a computer screen would negatively affect their eyesight and health, teachers would not be able to physically help the students if they are miles away from one another, and also because this would absurdly decrease interaction between students, therefore harming their social and conversational skills.

Every year, new studies are conducted on how television and phone screens harm not only our eyes but also our mental and physical health. Most teenagers and young adults spend multiple hours a day watching television, playing video games, or scrolling through their phones when they are bored and it negatively affects them greatly. Playing video games and watching television for too long has been linked to the killing of brain cells and also to decreased physical health because instead of getting exercise or playing outside, some would rather play on their computer or binge watch an entire television series in one sitting. My parents encourage my sister and I to go outside or play a board game instead of wasting our time re watching multiple episodes of

The Office on Netflix, but we just nonchalantly shrug off their advice and make up an excuse as to why we cannot, or do not, want to do so. From my own personal experience, after a few hours of focusing on a movie or a video game my eyes begin to hurt because of the immense strain that I have put on them and they continue to sting for multiple hours afterwards, sometimes making it difficult to fall asleep, let alone stay asleep.

Secondly, students that would attend school through video conferencing would not be able to access the personal touch and inter activeness of being within reach of a certified educator. I have struggled in many subjects before, but whenever I did not understand a subject or a certain lesson, I was always able to ask my teacher for assistance and explanations which helped greatly increase my understanding afterwards. I have stayed after school and received help during lunches on multiple occasions and after every tutoring session, I felt content in knowing that I reached out and got the help that I needed. However, this would not be an option for the students that decide to stay at home and attend online schooling. While explanations can be given through computer screens, only so much can be completely understood. For example, if there was a science lab held at school while a student was attending through the internet, that student would not possibly be able to experience and perform the lab that many others would because of their physical absence from the classroom. This is why physical attendance has always been a requirement and I do not believe that should change any time soon.

Lastly, if students were to attend school and receive their education through video conferences, then they would miss out on being socially active with other students and also on being a part of tradition. For almost a century, going to school and making friends and memories is an amazing journey that a great majority of our parents and grandparents experienced and want us to experience as well. People thrive on interaction with other people. Whether it be a long, heartfelt conversation or a brief one with few words spoken. When I am sick or under the weather and stay at home, I dreadfully regret it because I miss my friends and sometimes I become so bored of not being at school that I actually miss learning, too. You also cannot physically attend events during school if you are not present to do so, making it very difficult to enjoy other student's company and make memories because all you will every remember is sitting in an office, staring at a screen with no one to talk to, laugh with, and enjoy your teenage years with, and I do not believe that anyone should have to experience that, even if it is what they think they want.

However, it is understandable to want to be able to attend school through video conferencing. Video conferencing would allow students to stay in the comfort of their homes and to also wear practically whatever they would like to, like pajamas or baggy sweatpants. Attending through a video conference could also be very beneficial for those that are sick or unable to make it to school regularly. While these may seem appealing enough to want to have this option for your school, these benefits do not outweigh the negative costs of having little to no social interaction, having no personal, in person help from teachers, and also how it affects your health, both mental and physical.

In conclusion, implementing and allowing students to not physically attend school would not be beneficial for the students and therefore should not be considered. Allowing students to choose to learn from home should not be an option because it would negatively affect their social skills, their overall well being, and also put their grades and future at risk. Students need to enjoy school and think of it as a fun learning environment where they make memories with people they care about and love. Schools should not offer the option of attending through devices such as computer or phones because of these many reasons and more.
