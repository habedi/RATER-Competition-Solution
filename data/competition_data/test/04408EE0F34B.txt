Should people be texting and driving?

Even though people this they can do it without an accident, people should not be using a phone while driving. Teens, being the main group of people driving distracted, including the fact that the majority of they are newly trained drivers could cause more damage than just a crash. In 2017, over 3000 people were killed due to drivers being distracted. Some things aren't worth the risk and can just be pushed off to another time. While driving and using the device you are putting other drivers, passengers, bystanders and even yourself at risk of getting hurt or much worse.

In any case, while you are texting and driving, you are not thinking about anyone else other than yourself. The main thing going through a person's head while on their phone is what's happening on the screen. You readers may have, or know someone who could be looking at their phone and not hear a word someone says. It's already disrespectful to be on your phone while talking to somebody, so imagine how crazy it is to be on it while operating dangerous vehicle at high speeds. Texting and driving is more of an impulse, the driver is more worried about getting caught than hurt ,but the punishment of death and homicide is worse than texting and driving.

Without a doubt, you may think that the person you are texting or the game that you are playing can be done at another time. The game can wait till you are out of the car, but if you need to communicate with someone, there are many alternatives than doing it while driving. You have option to call someone and put your phone on spreaker so it will be out of your way, pulling over into a parking lot is also a choice and finally texting at a red light or stop sign only if its legal in your state. Like the famous quote from Star Trek, The

Wrath of Khan, "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few" meaning that you have to put the majority over yourself even if you think you shouldn't.

Although, you may not want to die, there are still more simple reasons you should avoid using your phone while driving. If you get caught you will have to pay an expensive fine and your car insurance will go up. Paying hundreds of dollars is not worth one text, one youtube video of anything else you could be doing on it. Most of the people who text and drive probably is doing it because they will be busy later, but going to court for a ticket will just add more to your schedule.

As a result, you as a reader can see all the risks and should yourself

"is this really worth it"? In a situation like this, the cons outweigh the pros and that's not good. If you want others to care about you then you have to respect yourself first to show them what it looks like. Think about the family of the kid you ran over all to heart some instagram post, it's not worth it. If you truly want to be a responsible driver, then obey the laws and don't use your phone while driving.
