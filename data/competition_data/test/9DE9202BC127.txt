To whom it may concern:

I believe it is helpful for students to perform community service because it helps other students feel good about themselves knowing that they helped other people. When students feel good then it makes the school they go to look good. If they don't feel good about themselves they might dress poorly and make the school look bad. If the students look good the school gets a better reputation and can get more students. The more students, the more a family wants to move into the community. Here are some reasons why I think students should be made to perform community service. It makes them feel better about them selves, it makes the school look better, and it makes other families want to be apart of the community.

One, it makes students feel better about themselves knowing they helped an object or person. If they help someone it makes both people feel better about themselves, if they helped an animal they feel happy knowing they did something for it. It's about how good the students feel in order for them to not be involved with gangs, drugs and violence. If they are involved with those things then it will help them see what they need to fix and maybe get them on the right path.

Two, It makes the school look better. Plus if the students are happy it gives the school a lighter atmosphere. When students and facility are happy, it makes the school that much of a happier place. When they are mad, it makes the school look like it's not doing its job. And that would scare potential students away. If the students are sad then it makes the school look like something happed that wasn't supposed to.

Three, more families in the community is more students for you and for your school. It can help spread the word because they will tell their friends about how great of a school this is. And when they tell their friends, their friends would probably want to come and bring their children. It is also expanding the community and letting us build more houses and, possibly, bringing a playground for the younger kids. Which would also lead back to community service, because if the older kids are babysitting then they won't get into as much trouble and they'll realize the value of a dollar.

In conclusion, I believe we should have students do community service because if they do than they will feel better about themselves, make the school look better, and it will make more people want to come into the community. Sir, with all the reasonings I have given you is all the reasons I believe we should make students do community service. It will help with the school and bring in more students. Why else wouldn't we want to do community service? Because some people don't want to get up? Because some people are lazy? It will help with lowering gang war fare, drug dealings in schools and with the younger population. So as you sit there, mulling over weather or not we should have community service, look back at the Pros and Cons of having community service, I hope I was able to help you with your decision.

Sincerely,

A concerned student.
