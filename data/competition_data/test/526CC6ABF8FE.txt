Dear Principal,

I believe students should be required to do community service for several reasons. I believe it helps support kids to do nice things for others without being told and makes things a lot easier for the people they are helping.

I believe it helps kids do nice things for others without being told to do so because kids should know right from wrong. They should know when they are doing something right for others, and when they know they are, they feel better about themselves and people see them differently and with more respect. For example, if more kids did things for others they would be a lot nicer and more helpful with others, and would do more for the community.

I also believe kids should do community service because it makes things a lot easier for other people. For example, if more kids helped out teachers by tutoring their students the teachers would have high grades in their classes. Also if more kids help out teachers by keeping their students busy, the teacher would have more time to grade. And with the short time she spent grading, there would be more time for fun activities for the students to enjoy. Another example would be if more kids would pick up trash on the floor or throw their trash away, or maybe even recycle, the community would have a good reputation for being clean.

Over all, if the community saw that more kids are doing work for everyone, then other people would do the same and help out. Community service is good for everyone in the community, that's why I believe kids should be required to help out and do community service and make things in the world, or the city, a lot easier.

Sincerely,
