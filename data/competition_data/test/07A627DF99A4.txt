In the community you could own a car but you were not allowed to park wherever you wanted. You had to park it in large garages and you have to buy space for $40,000 with a home. So most people didn't have cars but they were saving lots of money. 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there cars to move to the community. Most of the people liked walking around the community or just taking the transportation they gave them. It peaceful and less traffic.

Another advantage is that it reduces pollution and also reduces global warming. From source 2, "After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." If they did not leave thier cars at home they would have to pay a fine, 22-euro ($31). After they have had the cars off the streets "Congestion was down 60 percent in the of france, after five-days of intensifying smog..." The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer to trap car emissions. They also blamed the diesel fuel..."A tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vechicles in france, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines.."

From source 3, Colombia had a "car-free day" where all colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the transportion buses to work. For 3 years they have been doing this being they wanted to reuduce the smog. People who disobeyed had to pay $25 fines. " It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"said businessman Carlos Arthuro. Since people have started waliking or riding bicyles, they have improved the city by fixing the uneven sidewalks and making them smooth. Also since there is no traffic, " new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."
