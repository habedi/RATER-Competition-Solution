If I was a scientist at NASA, and I was discussing the Face with someone whos belifs were that the face was created by an anilen, I would tell them it was created by a landform because, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, the MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, and it was just a natural landform, A person part of the MOC said that when he saw the Face, it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and, when scientists first saw the Face, they figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.

First, when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, they snapped a picture that was ten times sharper then the orginail photos from the Viking, and it turned out just to be a natural landform. But people were not satisfied, they were saying that the camera on board had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face, maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze. So they looked again, Its not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. In fact, its hard work.'' said Gavin, but on a cloudless day, they looked again and found nothing but the landform again.

Second, When Gavin travled out to Mars he said that the landform reminded him of a natural landform in the American West. In the article, Gavin said It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Gavin looked at the face many times, even during the cloudly days and the cloudless days and he sees the Face as a landform, and there are pictures from a advanced camera to prove it.

Lastly, when the scientists at NASA first saw the Face they figured it was just another Martian mesa, which are common around the Cydonia area. Once the scientists released the photo of the Face to the world for all to see, thats when the problems started coming in. People and a few scientists were starting to believe it was actually a alien face, but most since the Martian mesa are really common around that area then why are people worrying? Its just a landform, not only did the Viking air shuttle take the pictures but also an advanced camera did.

I feel that the Face is just a landform, because scintists are proving that it is a landform with the advanced cameras that they are using, Scientists that are going out into Mars to look at the Face are saying that it reminded them of a landform that is known in America, and when the photo was first found by the Viking air shuttle the scientists first reaction to the picture that it was a landform, not an alien face.
