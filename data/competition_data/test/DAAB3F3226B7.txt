I strongly disagree. Because students should focus on there education not on yearbook or on some other activities at school.

I agree that sports keep as fit and healthy. But is sport worth as our education? NO! right then why do you guys want's as to participate in sports, making the yearbook,or other activities like this. WHY? if we give more time to sports or other activities our education can fall back our grades can drop down.

Teachers and parents want work from as is we give time to other activities at school then we won't have much time for our homework,projects, and our tests. When we ask the teachers do you accept late work they say no. This is when we say no to other activities at school. Because if they do not accept late work then we have to do it on time it's due to get better grads.

Just focus on your education and move on you can do sports later in life but you can't de educated later. This is your time learn something be something.

What would you say next time when your teacher asks you for participating in school activity would you say yes or no?
