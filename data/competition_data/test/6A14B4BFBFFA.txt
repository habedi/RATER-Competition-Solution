The enigma of summer projects. The summertime is a great time to learn something new and prepare for upcoming classes. Schools that offer summer projects to students should be designed by teachers, because they know best what they need to prepare their students for. Students who are motivated into taking the class, will do their required work. It shows that students who do not, should not take the class. Many classes that are assigned summer projects are college level classes and need the extra studying to proceed. Students should know what they are getting themselves into. Teachers would also have to grade the summer projects consistent. In fact, grading over hundreds of students papers is tiring but rewarding to learn students comprehensibility. Imagine it being student-based work, where the teacher would have no rubric to keep constant grades.

First, the students who choose to take the class. Depending on the class, there maybe limited seats available for students. For example, Psychology is a very popular class and only students with certain grades can take it as it is a limited seated class. Assigning teacher-based summer assignments could test students who actually want to take the class. That the class is not an easy A. Students who complete the project are expected to earn their spot. This makes the teachers teaching experience a bit easier, as they know what type of students they are getting.

Furthermore, the difficulty of the class. Depending on the level whether it is an advanced placement, college level class, or honor class; it is expected to study over the summer. Teachers make the best choices for their students especially on their summer projects. Teachers are informed of any changes made to the curriculum, this is crucial in college classes as the exam is very specific. For example, the College Board could decide to exclude a part of the exam, or add in new modules. The exams are constantly getting updated and teachers could use the summer projects as the best time to include new information the board has decided to add.

In addition, the rubric will be kept the same. This benefits both parties as for teachers they know exactly what answers they are looking for, and this would make grading hundreds of papers more efficient. For example, multiple students may have gotten a certain question incorrect, the teacher could then discuss the answer and overall deal with any confusion. For students, getting an answer wrong could allow them to reach out to another for the correct answer and solve questions together. Improving team work and social skills.

All in all, teacher-based summer projects are easier to grade. It tests students their dedication to the class and the level of understanding. It excludes any students who assume the class is easy or simply do not do their work. There are no shortcuts to complete the teachers project. Just like how there are no shortcuts in life. It also shows that students must be prepared for class beforehand and take responsibility. Especially goes for college level classes as changes are inevitable.Â
