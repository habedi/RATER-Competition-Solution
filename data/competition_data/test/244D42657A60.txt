Summer is a part of the year were students and families can take it easy and relax. Their are many things to do over the summer, students generally spend their time at the ; beaches, pools, a relatives house, and even at a summer job. With all of these activites sometimes students forget what they have learned in school. This is a big problem because everything you learn at school builds up on itself and gets more advanced as you continue through the year. Some school countys realized this and decided to take action. Their solution was to assign summer projects so that the students can retain the information they just learned in there current school year. Many students don't like the idea of summer assignments because it takes away from their break from school. If it was teacher-designed students wouldn't be motived to complete it, if it was student-designed students wouldn't learn the right material. That leads us to the question, should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?

When students are required to do something they aren't particually intrested in, they start to lack motivation or intrest. The same logic can be compared to summer assignments, if the project isn't intresting to students, they probably won't give it a lot of their effort. Which also leaves students to hold it off until the end of the summer. The solution to this problem would be to make the projects student-designed. When you assign yourself with a project you tend to do it with more motivation and more reasoning. This is because when you assign yourself something it is usually done with a reason and you have motivation to complete it.

Some might argue that the project should be teacher-designed because the teacher knows what the students learned and whats best for them, doing so, would help the student retain information important to the teacher, thus setting them up for success next school year. This is a very intresting point and it is understandable to have the teacher explain whats best for them. Though it still doesn't keep the student motivated. As explained before, students work better when they work on assignments designed by them. This helps the student stay motivated to retain the information better rather than putting it off and waiting till the end of summer.

The way the project will work is as follows, the student will be given options by the teacher as to what project ideas are avalible, as chosen by the majority of the class. The student will then be given a way to work on the project, this could be a posterboard, presentation slide show, or a physical demonstration. Then they will have all summer to work on it. When they comeback to school they will be required to present their project to the class. That way the students inform others as well as retain information for the new school year. To motivate to students even more they will be given a grade on how well they do on the project. That way they will be set up for success.

In conclusion, the projects would be more benifital to the students if they were student designed. That way students can retain the information during the summer as well as having a good time over the break. Though others might ague that if the project was teacher-designed it would be more benifital to the student, we fixed that by giving the teachers a say in the project by having them pick out project ideas while the rest of the project was in the hands of the student. All in all the projects should be student-designed to give them motivation and advancement.
