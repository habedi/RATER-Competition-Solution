I believe that making students participate in at least one extracurricular activity would be helpful.

Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because It will give them some college credit, Help them learn what they are good at, it could help as a stress reliever.

If a student participated in a extracurricular activity, they would earn college credit and help them have more chances to get into the college they want to be in. For example, If he or she would be on a sports team like track, It would boost them some credit for college for more paths to take.

Also, being in a group or activity will boost your chance of getting a high school diploma. Another example, If a student isn't gonna have enough points to get a diploma, if he or she is in a group or extracurricular activity that might be enough to boost them up to help them get the diploma.

Joining on a activity that you may dislike or your not that experienced at may help you learn it more and start enjoying it more. The more you try at it, the more you will enjoy it and it will become a hobby you do.

An example, If a student joined a art group and at first they may not enjoy it, overtime it will get better and they will start getting more experienced and better at art and enjoy art. He or she might even want to pursue it as a career if you're that experienced at it.

Joining a group will introduce you to new people who you can become friends with. It will become more fun when you make friends in the activity you are in. When you join a group or activity with people, you can easily make a lot of friends if you get to know them better. You would need to work as a team to get the job done in the activity and by doing that most likely you will make a friend by collaborating together. If you were to join a group and you all need to work together to make a huge project, once you all team up together you have a group of friends to hang out with.

Joining a group or activity will help the students get rid of stress or anxiety they have from a huge test or project.

For example, if a student has a huge project due in a week and he or she is not close to being done, going to the activity will relieve the stress for a little bit and cool down their emotions. Also, doing a sport activity will be a huge stress reliever. Doing all the running and working out will make you forget about all the stressful things in life. If you have a friend in that activity it will make you totally forget about all the stressful things too.

That is why I believe students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity and It's because It will give them some college credit, Help them learn what they are good at, let them meet new people and it could help as a stress reliever.
