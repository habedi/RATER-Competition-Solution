Extracurricular activities

Students should have extracurricular activities.

Having extracurricular activities can benefit students in many different ways.

First, when students have extracurricular activities, it will make them want to try harder in school.

When students try harder in school, their grades may increase.

When their grades increase, they have a better chance of getting a job than what other students have.

Students could push themselves to success depending on what activity they have.

Second, when students get the chance to have more activities, they could be inspired about their future occupation.

Having extracurricular activities could inspire kids to get jobs and want them to become successful.

When students have this opportunity, it could help them see their future.

If a student does not have the activity that they were hoping for, there are still more activities for the student to chose from.

Lastly, when students get to participate in the yearbook, sports, and student council, it will make them want to do it again next year and the years later.

Students get to make new friends and it will make them want to come to school everyday.

When students come to school everyday, the schools grades and attendance as a whole could increase because students are willing to come to school because of their extracurricularÂ activity.

It could also help students make more friends because maybe somebody does not have anyone to love them at home.

They have the students there to help them feel comfortable and welcomed at school and maybe they will come to school everyday.

In conclusion, students should have extracurricular activities to make them want to try harder in school, learn about more careers for the future, and help students make new friends.

These are my reasons students should have extracurricular activities.
