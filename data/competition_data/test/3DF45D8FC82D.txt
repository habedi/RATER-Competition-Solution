If you live in America, would you join the Seagoing Cowboys? Afterall, we do get to sail around the world helping devestated countries. As a Seagoing Cowboy you get to explore and have fun on the job.

At the job, I got to adventure an excavated castle in Crete and I marveled at the Panama Canalon on my way to China. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys was one of my most biggest things I've done . I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Besides the amazing sights, I also had to help with the animals on board.

My responability was to feed, water, and clean out the cell of all the animals. So far, 9 trips over the Atlantic Ocean and I sailed over the Pacific Ocean once. We travel across the world to help destroyed countries get started back up. The UNRRA

(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) is what started this country recover system. The UNRRA helped recover the country's food supplies, animals, and more. Our ship carried a cargo with 335 horses atleast and enough hay and oats to feed them. This expetition made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

So overall, if you don't participate in the UNRRA then you ar missing out. This once in a life time opportunity. If missed, you have missed out on one of the greatest trips you'll ever go on.
