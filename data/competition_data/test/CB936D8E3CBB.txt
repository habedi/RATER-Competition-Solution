The use of cell phones has increased over the past few years, technology seems as if it is taking over. We need technology in just about everything we do. People use cell phones in their every day lives. Cell phones provide a quick and easy way to access important information, a quick call or easy access to the internet. Cell phones usage has it pros and cons. Cell phones are used for safety causes like emergencies. It is not safe to use cell phones on the road, but it is a quick way to contact the police in an emergency. It is said that cell phones are a great way for communication, but using cell phones while driving distracts the driver from the road, which is very dangerous for the driver and other drivers on the road.

Millions of people are using their cell phones right now. Cell phones provide communication. Cell phones have several benefits, including a camera, music, games, messaging, internet access and apps that can be downloaded for work or school. Cell phones can provide comfort and safety. Cell phones also have dangerous side effects. People may get too attached to their phone, use it while driving or for illegal matters. The main thing with driving while using a cell phone is that it can cause the death of the driver as well as others. In my opinion I do not think anyone should have their phone out while driving. I feel as if it is an emergency you should pull over and handle your situation. That one moment you pull your phone out could cause a big accident. I believe it is best if you keep your phone up and if you feel as if you need to make a call, text someone you should wait and pull over or just wait until you get where you are going.

Cell phones are not the only thing that can distract the drivers from the road. Lighting a cigarette, talking to a passenger, eating and drinking can all distract the driver and make it unsafe. The distraction of the driver could cause them to miss road signs or switching over to the wrong side of the road. However, cell phone usage on the road may be one of main causes of accidents and deaths. Using your cell phone does not only distract you from the road, but also in class or at work. Cell phones has became a big distraction in our everyday life. Kids and teens isolate themselves from family and family time/functions because they would rather be on cell phone then go outside. Some people cannot even watch a movie without being distracted, or cannot have real conversations because they are obsessed by what is on their phone.

In conclusion, cell phones are a great way of communication, but using cell phones while driving distracts the driver from the road which is dangerous for the driver and other drivers on the road. Cell phones have their pros and cons, but I believe cell phones have a bigger negative impact, especially if used irresponsibly. Everything is about cell phones and other technology items. While it is an effective way of communication, it can also be a leading cause of accidents and deaths.
