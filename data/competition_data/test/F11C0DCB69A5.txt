Giving details and information, I think the author explained well the dangers of Venus. He explained the temperatures and how hot it can get there, how it can melt metal things and that it's just not worth living there. But it is worth exploring as in studying it, the rocks and maybe they can find something that could possibly live there. The author supports the idea of studying by saying in paragraph 8 how "Venus has value" and how "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limilted by dangers and doubts but she be expanded to meet the very edges or imagination and innovation.

The author says that it gets over 800 F in Venus, says that it could've been possibly like Earth years ago, where humans can live in. But NASA has to do more studying on rocks and other sediments and onjects on Venus. The author explaines how much carbon dioxide is covering Venus, and I believe carbon dioxide is so good for a planet. The planet isn't very useful to live in since it crushes metalic things, and for example cars, something we need to get around places.
