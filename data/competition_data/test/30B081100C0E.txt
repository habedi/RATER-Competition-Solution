In this article about the Facial action Coding System I think that this invention from thomas huang would be super great. For example if someone was feeling down and didnt think the could talk to anyone about it. This would be shown only on percentages which woudnt tell you much but it also coud help.

I think it would help many things in our nearing future we could help many more people if they were feeling sadness or deppression. Also it would be good to know how people are feeling without them saying a word to them If you had a bad day at home or something that would be great for people to understand what your feeling and just not bother you.

In conclusion I think that it would be a greta idea for them to have a machine that would understand and recongize ur emotions because it could make people's lives alot more simple. This could help a man at his job he didnt sleep well that night his boss looks through the machine and notices that his worker only got ten percent of sleep last night and lay's off
