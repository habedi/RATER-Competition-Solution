In the passage the author gave some really good information about the new inovation to emotional technology. As the technology world is growing we are going to have new opertunities such as this one to make our life's easier. But the real question is this good? Or could it be bad?

Honestly i think it would be a great invention and it would sell great on products like Apple phones and also it would be great for students with homework. Technology is always growing and the new products will make it grow more and more popular. How the world is now it will become over popular and i think too much of a good thing is a bad thing like fruits they are good for you but if you eat too many you could consume a mass amount of sugar. In the passage the author said "For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smililar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." How would they know what your facial expression is? By watching through a camera and what else can the camera see? Humans relie in the enternet to bank for us, communicate for us, and know everything for us. Losing our phone is like losing our wallet. The enternet knows way too much information about us let alone when they know our facail expressions.

As much as people would love to have this technology the world could live without it. Students could ask thier techer for help so they know how to solve the hard problems. And people could learn to tell others facial expressions.
