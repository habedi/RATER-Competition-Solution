Dear principal,

I understand your viewpoint on this topic but I am not with you on this one. I have reasons why. One reason is because a C really is not that bad. Its still passing but its not like a D or an F. Another reason is because some subjects can be difficult for students and if they do not understand the subject its not fair to say that they cannot play a sport or any other activities.

Kids tend to love to play sports or do a school activity. Its just a known fact. Its good for them and gives them a break from work and school. I could understand if you said that if a student has a D or an F, but a C? I know they aren't the best grades, but i think that if the student puts effort into their work that they should be able to play sports. A c is still passing. I can see that if the student just does nothing and doesn't try, but makes it by with a c then he doesn't deserve to play a sport. As long as the student tries he or she should be able to play a sport or do an activity.

Subjects in school can be a lot of trouble with grades. Some students can just understand certain things better than another one can. I know that math is not my strongest subject and sometimes i don't understand it. Kids around the world have trouble with a certain subject. If they do it can affect your grade. If the student does not understand their science test, but he studied for almost an hour the night before and still doesn't do well then i don't think you should really say that he cant play a sport. If someone is a bad in a certain subject but they try their hardest then they should be able to participate in sports and school activities. The student may be very talented in the sport but not in the subject. I think you should understand this.

I know you think that kids need to do better to participate in activities. They should do better but i think all of the kids around the world will say something close to what I said. The biggest part is that a c is not that bad. Its just one away from a b. The student could have a high c and be so close to a b that he can taste it. Just think about the subject the student has a c in. Try to see if he tries or if he doesn't. I don't think a grade c average is not that bad as long as the student tries his or hers hardest to pass. Its not failing so it really is not that bad.
