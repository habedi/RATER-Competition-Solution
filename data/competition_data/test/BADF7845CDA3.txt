Dear Principal,

I have just discovered this new policy you have decided that us as students can't participate in school sports unless we have a grade B average. I do not think this is a very good policy because if you are really good in sports, but your not the best at science, or math or any subject that wouldn't fair to them. I personally have one subject I am not doing very well in, but I try and do my work and maintain the average of low B and high C. So that would consider me unable of not doing any sports. I love sports, my life revolves around sports. But just because I'm not doing good in one subject that doesn't mean I can't be part of something that makes me happy, makes me health.

I also think that if you make this policy happen, kids may turn bad. if you make this happen you will just help the population of kids turning to bad influences. I know from experiences that the kids that have been on my team in the past were good at the sports they did and instead of going to a party or going in the woods to do bad things, we were at practice working as hard as we can just to win divisions, or even states. There were girls in the past who couldn't do math or didn't understand some subjects but they tried hard and maintain an A, B or C average. It wouldn't be fair to the girls who try in school, but just aren't good at the subject.

My last reason is that if you change this policy, you could ruin the chances of some kids who are amazing at sports chances of getting a scholarships in sports. I know for one thing me personally I want a scholarship so badly, and I work for it too. But if I get a C in one subject that could ruin my chances of practicing and competing. Which is really hurtfully because I've worked my whole life for a scholarship. So instead of me or anyone being a pro or being an Olympic winner, we'll be working at Subway for the rest of our life's earning practically nothing. And I don't want my future to come to this quote, " Welcome to Subway, what can I get you?"

In the end, I hope that you don't change the policy, because if you do a lot of kids will have there whole life changed and maybe even ruined. And its not like a C isn't passing because it is and you should have a passing grade to play sports. Most people in school have a C or B average because its most common. And as a Principal you should be the one supporting us to be in sports and after school actives, you should know that most parents say to their kids is to get involved. In conclusion I hope you make the choice that benefits us all as students and a school.

Sincerely,
