Dear Principle

I think you should not allow students to use cell phones because they will not focus in class because they will take it to far. And they will text in class instead of pay atenshon to the lesson at hand. They will then during lunch cause fights during lunch because the made someone mad with one of the messages they sent to someone and that cane be a problem for the school. Another reason is that they could be sending messages while walking down the hall and run into some one plus they might go the wrong way while reading a message and then they will be late for class. Another reason why students shouldn't use phones is they might say there going to the bathroom when there in class so the teacher gives them a pass and the student goes into the bathroom just to look at the messages they go before class started. Another reason is that if you let them use cell phones if they went to the library them and there friends all had it planed so when they go they will all go together and hang out because during lunch they all sent messages to each other about it and when they get there who knows what they will do. Another reason is the will be on the phone when they are supposed to be reading because they took it to far and now they fell like they have the power to do any thing during class. Another reason why you they wouldn't work is they would rather text then learn so it wouldn't work out. Those are some reasons why you shouldn't let them use there cell phones.
