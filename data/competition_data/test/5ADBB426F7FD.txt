Dear Principal,

Well I am against your consideration of changing the schools policy. It shouldn't matter if students have bad or good grades just to play sports. If you were to see or make a survey about students who play or participate in sports. You would surprise yourself to see that the average would have at least a C. Now Lets say you do change the policy all you would do would be take either their hobby, dream, entertainment away.

Many students she sports as a hobby. Which as usual they would do almost every day. Others would she it as there dream to be a famous football, soccer, baseball, basketball, etc. player. As for some other students use it ass entertainment to get their mind off of thing that bug them. And if i had to say so sometimes is because of their grades. Which most of the time it helps them a lot.

So I'm guessing you wouldn't want to change the school policy after all because it would really affect them. As I was saying students with bad grades sometimes there not so bad because either they have a C or a D. Which i think is better than having an F. Now your policy says "unless they have at least a grade B average." Most of the time students are close to a B, but their average is a C. Keep in consideration.

Now imagine it were to be you. Put yourself in your favorite sport, and pretend you were on your way to play as your coach comes by and says "sorry you can't play cause you need a B average and all you have is a C average." And all you say is "But i have a C" That would really break you wouldn't it and all because the principal changed the policy. Hope you really think about your actions, and what the consequences would be.

Sincerely,
