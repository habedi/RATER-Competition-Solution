A driverless car is a very useful thing in concept.

You would be able to complete objectives other than your own transportatin while being transported.

But that is only provided that you are being taken to your destination without haveing to worry about the transportaion.

The whole point of a driverless car is that you let the car do all the work while you atend to your daily acivities, but the car being adveratised is a half driverless car where any obsticals between point A and point B have to be handled by the user.

As of now, the "driverless" car is a wasted investment.

Despite not being very usefull, lets assume someone buys the half driverless car.

They would have to have an incredibly vast amount of welth to do so.

Then if they were the kind of person the advaratisers are adveratiseing to they would keep their eyes on the road and "enjoy" the ride, while still having to drive arond obstcals ocasionaly.

So they'd just be doing a more boreing version of driveing.

But not everyone is careful like those people.

Without a doubt, someone would not do their reserch and assume the driverless car is completly self-operated.

They would get in the car, start it, and then do something that advacates of safe driveing have been trying to stop for years.

Wether it be texting of drinking intoxicating substances, or even cautching up on sleep.

Even the safest person would completly loath the half driverless car due to how boreing it would get.

At least regular driveing allows some interaction between the machine and the driver so the oporator can stay engaged.

The half driverless car is too impractical to be used by anyone

So the half driverless car is out, but what if google or some other car selling establishment was able to succeed in making a completly driverlss car?

Well, it still wouldn't turn out okay.

Every taxi driver, school bus driver, public bus driver,and at some point, maybe even pilot, would be out of a job.

So thousands of people would lose their jobs becausen they were no longer needed to transport people.

This could portentally increse the homeless population and increse the number of people doing illegal things to get by.

In conclusion, the half driverless car would not work safey with most people today, and the driverless car would shrink the job market.

While not bad ideas, they are both incredibly innificent and cross-productive.
