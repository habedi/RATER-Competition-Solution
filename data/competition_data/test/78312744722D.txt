Dear, principal

I think that the average grade should stay at a C+ average because a c is a little low and a solid b is a little high for the average. i also think that the behavior of the students should reflect if he gets to play contact sports because if they have are bad, then they will most likely take sports over school and fall behind. that is also why i think the standards should go up just not that much because you could do good in school and still get a c+ or b- and not be able to play sports. i myself play sports and i would not like it if i could not play because i was average. that would be bad to me, and be bad to many others. you could be missing one or two assignments and get a c so that would be unfair and you should always be fair. another reason i think is should be a c+ is that it is shooting high but not too high that it would fall. that means that it would be just a little bit better than average but not so high that you would get so frustrated and just give up on one thing and fully concentrate on the other.

sincerely,
