I disagree that we as students should have to do extracurricular activities,because some students may not want to do any of these things or some kids may just be extra shy. I would be one of those students that wouldn't want to do this extra activity,because if my parents don't take me to school they would't want to come to the school to pick me up. Not only would the kids dislike it so would some of the parents, because the ones that already take their kids to school would complain about why does their kid have to do these activities and why they have to pick them up later after school. Another reason is because I know that some of the students would not like this at all, and those students may say that they are going to do the extracurricular activity, but then don't show up or they won't participate.

Also the "shy" kids or the quiet kids may not like this either and you wouldn't here their thoughts about this, because they are the quiet kids. Then these students would just bottle up their thoughts and emotions about the extra activities, and some of the quiet kids may become sad because they think that no one wants to even consider their ideas for something different. No principal would want their students to feel sad,right. I just think that those students should be allowed to speak to a teacher or someone else in charge and not in public in front of a bunch of people, because then they wont say anything but it should be done some where private.

Furthermore us as students don't like it when new rules just randomly appear to our knowledge. Just ask us if we would like to do things like extra activities, don't just come up to us and say "these are the new rules now follow them". We know that as students we're not in control of the rules,but if we don't like the ideas that you bring to us then you should probably add something different or just change that idea into a new one.
