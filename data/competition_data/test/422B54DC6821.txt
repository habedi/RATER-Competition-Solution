The Face is nothing more than just some landmark. Sure, it may have looked like a face in 1976 but now we have better technology to study it. From what we have found, its just a landmark, you're a scientist, not a conspirasist. You are just believing what you want to beleive, and what you believe has no scientific evidence.

When the mesa looked most like a face was in 1976, that was over 20 years ago. Technolgy has advance since 1976, I mean look at what we have now compared to back then. The NEWER photos from the NEWER peice of technology, the Mars Global Surveyor, has taken better photos of the mesa. That's right: a mesa.

Even when you get disproved, you try to argue about it, now you're just arguing from a point of ignorance. Gavin said, and i quote, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the sameheight as the Face on Mars."

In conclusion, there is no face on Mars, just a mesa. You are arguing from a point of ignorance because anything you can be shot down almost immedently. Technology has advanced to meaning that we can get a better look at the mesa. So just look at the facts, and stop believing everything you hear. You're a scientist for crying out loud, act like one.
