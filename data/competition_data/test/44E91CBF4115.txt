Summer school projects should be student lead because they allow students to keep their brain fresh, achieve a goal, and understand new concepts. School projects over the summer should be student designed. This allows students to keep their brain active, have a goal to accomplish, and learn new things. Projects to complete over the summer are a good tool for schools to use to keep their students ready.

Some students might think a project for school over the summer is tyranny, however, keeping your brain thinking is very important. An interesting project, that should be mainly student-designed so completion is high, is a good brain helper. A benefit of the project will be once the students go back to school, it'll be easier to jump back into familiar topics because your brain has had a refresher recently. Freshman year of high schoolÂ I had an English project over the summer on Mythology which greatly helped me when I returned to school and Mythological stories was our first unit. Overall, keeping your brain up-to-date is an excellent way to be confident in your schooling career.

During summer break a lot of kids end up being bored at home just watching TV or playing video games. A project, designed by students so the kids can stay engaged and interested, could shake this monotony and give the student a goal to accomplish. Goals are important and they lead to the person feeling good about themselves once they complete said goal. On the other hand, a student might say how they don't need a goal to stay active during the summer but they can always benefit from something to hold them accountable so just in case the student starts heading on a downward trend, the goal can lift them up and set them back on track.

Learning new things is an important task to do often. Having a student lead project is a great strategy to allow kids to find and learn new things, explore new concepts, and complete tasks efficiently. Kids learning new things over the summer with a rigorous yet interest-grabbing project is an excellent way to expand the classroom horizon once school is back in session. It allows the teacher to make new teaching decisions such as what projects will look like in the future, what kind of strategies to teach with, and if said teacher can branch off into side topics that they usually couldn't branch off into.

In conclusion, school-assigned projects should be student-designed so interest and completion is high, goals are made and completed, and the students' brain is kept in top shape. The ability a kid has to learn by themselves over the summer should be tapped into by schools more often. Projects to complete over the summer are a perfect tool to keep kids fresh and ready for when school starts back up.
