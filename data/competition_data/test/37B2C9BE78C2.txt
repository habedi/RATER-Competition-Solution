Dear Principal,

I believe that you should let teenagers bring their cell phones to school and contact people during their lunch period. You should do this because some teenagers might need their cell phone for after school activities. For instance, RELATIVE_NAME has baseball practice after school and needs to tell his mother that he needs to stay after. RELATIVE_NAME can't call from the office phone because their lines can't use that certain area code. So, in his case he can use his cell phone to call or text his mother and tell her that he has to stay after.

I do know that some teenagers will text during class, but that is up to the teachers to be paying attention to their students and not their computer or other activities. As you can see teens might need their cell phone in school for a useful reason, not just to text their friends. You will need to advise teachers will need to pay more attention to their students if you are going to come through with this idea. In the other free times and lunch period is usually the best time to contact people because you will not get in trouble for having a cell phone out. It is hard to hide a cell phone in class, in that case most teens will not try to hide it. Only few students will actually try to succeed; and it is fairly easy to tell when a student is texting.

In conclusion you should let teenagers have their cell phone at school but only be allowed to contact people with them in free times. Also because, even if you do say no cell phones allowed at all about 60% will still bring theirs in.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
