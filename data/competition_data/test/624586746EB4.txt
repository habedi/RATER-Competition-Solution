Have you ever finished a long tedious year of school and on the last day you were given a project to do over the summer? Well if thats the case, then you probably know that most schools in the united states require students to complete summer projects to ensure they sustain their efforts in their studies. The main question here is: should these summer projects remain teacher-designed, or should they be student-designed?

While having teacher based summer projects, you dont have to worry about coming up with any ideas; However, this is a project that students must complete during break. In that case, they should be able to have a say in what they do for the project. Summer projects should be student-based because it allows students to have creative freedom, work on what they want, and makes it easier for teachers.

So to start things off, summer projects should be merely student-designed, because it allows for creative freedom. Millions of students would rather not do any sort of project over the summer because it's their summer break; However, if students were given the creative freedom to come up with their own exquisite and unique ideas, then i'm sure student would appreciate that more and wouldn't mind contributing to their summer academic studies.

I personally would enjoy having this type of creative freedom.

While on the topic, if student-designed projects were to become a reality, then allowing students to choose what exactly they want to do for their summer project would great. By doing so, it will encourage students to choose an academic area that they have a high morale in. For example, say i was good in math but not so much in English, in that case i would design a math based project to keep myself from losing that academic grasp. This also ties in with the freedom that students will have if student-designed summer projects become a thing.

But most importantly, don't forget about the teachers. Sure they may get payed a good or decent salary, but a lot of the time by the end of the year their usually all stressed; especially the unfortunate teachers that are stuck with all the trouble makers. Teachers deserve a nice hard earned break too, so by letting the students choose what and how to do their project, it'll most certainly lighten their work load. From what I have witnessed, teachers seem a lot more weary and burnt out by the end of the year; they're just waiting for that nice summer break like the students are.

Finally to wrap things up, In order for students to sustain academic value, summer projects are necessity;

however, summer projects should be student-based because it allows students to have creative freedom, work on what they want, and makes it easier for teachers. Students having freedom to choose what academic course they want to do whether to strengthen or to keep the academic grasp, must become a reality. It will also help teacher out a great deal as well. Whether you're a student or a teacher, I hope that you as the reader agree with this firm statement, and hopefully this new idea will be brought into existence.
