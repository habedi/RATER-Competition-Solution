I'm going to be against to their technology that they're using because they are using the technology to see what other people feel about something. The technolgy could tell how we feel by the facial expression and your movements of the facial muscles. They are looking for a better way for human and computer to communicate. The computer could model the face of the 44 major muscle like a human muscles movement is called a action unit. i don't like the computer to see our emotion because its like someone watching or i feel like someone stalking like watching what i'm doing. They could use in the classroom to see someone who is bored or confused of the worked. The computer could when u smile but we know it doesn't lie about what u feel. If u fake smile it could tell that ur not really smiling. They were studying the picture painting of mona lisa to see if it show the feeling what she have. They want to studying the facial expression on the painting or real life face. They are studying the emotion of what people feel about. They are creating the emotion on other people feeling.
