In some schools, projects are given to students to be completed over summer break. The reason a vigarious assignment is given is to assure students will be continuously learning over the summer when schools are temporarily closed. However, should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Teacher-designed projects should be required for all students. Why should teacher-designed projects be a requirement instead of student-designed projects? Teacher-designed projects expand learning and the teacher is aware of what the students will be learning.

To begin, teachers will be aware that all students are obtaining the same information. For example, a project was given by a teacher specifically on the topic saving and investing in today's economy. The teacher knows that all students will be researching and learning the concepts of saving and investing today. All students gained identical information and knowledge on one specific topic. On the other hand, if projects were student-designed there will be little unity of knowledge amongst students who are of equal age and grade classification.

To continue, teacher-designed projects will expand the knowledge of students. If projects were student-designed they would more likely focus on a topic they already have prior knowledge about rather than stepping outside of their comfort zone. Teacher-designed projects tend to include circulum that students need to know that will help them grow academically. For instance, a group of girls in a high school class were given a black history project. They did their project on Misty Copeland, an African-American ballet dancer, who they had previously researched before. They had information instilled into their minds and had already known about her accomplishments and struggles. They did not learn anything about her, because they had done projects before. With that being said, students will not willingly learn anything new if they designed their on projects. Teacher-designed projects would have a more positive impact, because it is being given by a teacher who can academically prepare students for the next school year.

Last but not least, teacher-designed projects enforce specific directions and learning criteria. The projects will less likely be done incorrectly. Directions and criteria is specific, so it will not be off topic and the students will not be learning unnecessary information that will not help them. Teacher-designed projects are more focused on criteria that students need to know.

Conversely, student-designed projects can be more engaging for students who like to be creative, or do things in their own manner. The options are limitless and researching what a student wants to learn will inspire them to obtain more knowledge to share with their peers. Students will be more interested in a project they can create themselves and that leads to results such as less cheating. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects should be required, because some students will focus on what they already know rather than willingly learning something new. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects will not limit students to what they already know, but will help them grow academically. The projects that are teacher-designed will less likely be done incorrectly, because the teacher specifies instructions and limits the topics for their projects. Students will flourish more when projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed. Schools should require summer projects that are teacher-designed.
