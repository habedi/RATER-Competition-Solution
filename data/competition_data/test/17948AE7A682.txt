Have we seen any form of life on Mars so far? No, that's why it's clearly a natural landform. Plus, how do the aliens know what we look like. They could look completely different from us. It just so happens that the natural landform look's like a face.

Why would the aliens spend their time making a two mile long face anyways? These natural landform's are common in Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It is indeed interesting and cool to think that it was built by aliens, but it wasn't built by aliens. Don't get me wrong, everyone wishes it was made by aliens, but facts are facts.

In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the landmark and got a couple photo's that are ten times better than the 1976 photo's. It was confirmed that the landmark wasn't a face it was just the shadow's that made it look like a face. But of course, skeptics thought the alien markings were hidden by haze. "It's not easy to target Cydonia" says Garvin. "In fact, it's hard work."(Paragraph 9)

Then, on April 8, 2001, four years after the last photo, another couple of photo's were taken. These photo's were way clearer than the photo's from 1998. " As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," Garvin added. " So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" This is proof that aliens did not make this landform.

As you can see, there is plenty of edvidence that the two mile head is a natural landform. Their is way more convicing stories about this topic. But I hope that my side of the argument conviced you that the landform wasn't built by aliens.
