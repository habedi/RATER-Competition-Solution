Because it's a common activity for most people, sending a text doesn't seem dangerous. However, when you're doing it behind the wheel, there are a ton of other factors at play. Driving is a privilege because of the inherent risk and responsibility we all need to assume out on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers.

It can be hard to grasp the dangers of texting and driving, but once you know the facts, this hazardous habit starts to become a reality. When you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. In just the 5 seconds it takes to send or read a short text message, you've already zoomed past the length of a football field with minimal attention on the road ahead. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children.

No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel.

When you're behind the wheel, you should always be considerate of other drivers and remember you're putting your life at risk while texting and driving.

Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed?

While driving, you should always be focused on getting from point A to point B. Having any kind of mobile device in your hand while driving puts your life at a major risk. Once driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text message, suddenly the driver's life is changed by a horrific accident. People should definitely reconsider before pulling out their phones while on the road. Dr
