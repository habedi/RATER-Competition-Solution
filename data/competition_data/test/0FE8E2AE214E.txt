I see why you think that aliens could have formed it. In 1976 it looks like a face and we all were surprised about it, but we needed more evidence. The picture quality was not the best so we went back out there in April 5, 1998 and we snapped another picture of the so called "face".

The camera that we used was ten times sharper picture than the first picture that we took. We looked at the picture that we took and there was no alien monument after all, but the picture still wasn't that well of quality. Not everyone was satisfied.

On April 8, 2001,a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, we decided to take another picture but with better quality. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face so we could clearly see it. We captured a photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixle spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo. It was clear that it was just a land form and no signs of alien form.
