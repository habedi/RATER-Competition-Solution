Dear Principal,

In school, grades and sports play an important roll in the future of the students. Sports are meant to keep young people out of trouble and are enjoyable to many people. In order to keep kids motivated to do better in school, their grades should have to be acceptable. I agree that a B average should be the lowest grade a student should maintain in order to continue in their sport or activity.

The future of the students is more important than the extra activities, in my opinion. If the student cant keep the grade at a B average and try their hardest to complete their school work, I don't think they need the sport as a distraction.

When the students reach adulthood, their test scores will most likely effect their career choices, not how well they were athletically. To get young people to succeed, sometimes they need a little push in the right direction.

To motivate students to do better in school, i believe grades should effect whether they can participate in certain sports or not. Education is the way to a better life.

Sincerely,
