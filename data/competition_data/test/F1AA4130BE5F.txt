Dear Principle,

The 2 policies are very reasonable but i only agree to one. I think that policy 1 is better for a few reasons. The first reason is because if kids have the liberty to have cell phones, then if there is a emergency, they can quickly get help or call 911. another reason is because during free time, if kids can text each other, there will be less talking and distracting noise in the classrooms or at lunch.

There are some disadvantages to policy 1 that might convince you to switch your opinion to policy 2. One reason is because cell phones can go off in class if students forget to turn them off between periods. another reason is because cell phones can become very distracting and can keep students away from work. some cell phones have games or other entertaining app's on their phone that would be hard to avoid playing.

The reason i go with policy 1 is because students need opportunities to be safe and express freedom in America. If kids get cell phones in school then it would express their rights as citizens. Cell phones are very helpful in emergencies. An example; a kid named justice is in the class Concepts of Engineering and Tech and he is working with some equipment when he accidentally cuts his finger bad. One student could call 911 while the other could call justices parents and warn them in a matter of seconds. Even if they are distractions they can also save lives.

I do encourage you to pick cell phone policy 1 because i believe that it is the right choice for our school. Sure policy 2 is better for education but the principle of having cell phones makes a big difference.
