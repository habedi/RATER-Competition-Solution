Well, personally i feel as though "distant learning" is something that could be beneficial; or it could be very harmful. If you weigh it out it has an equal propensity to be successful and to be a failure; let me explain. When I looked at this very unbiased and strictly looking at certain variables I figured there are at least five reasons this could fail or thrive, those reasons five reasons it could be helpful are: you could learn more from being in the comfort of your own home, you're less likely to become sick, able to eat exactly what you want, never late for school, and always able to be in class even if you're sick.

But, the there are five reasons i thought off the top of my head why it could fail: no real social interactions, wouldn't be able to truly participate in all aspects of school, household distractions, could sometimes forget you still "in school" and not follow dress code, and won't be able to have all the "real life" experiences as ever other student.

Now yes, I know exactly what somebody will say, "well that's just for you that's not for everybody." And you are correct this is my thought process on what I think "distant learning" could be. I have no real way to test it nor to validate my opinion into fact; but this is prompt asked my opinion so that's what I'm giving. So what I'm going to do is elaborate on points that I feel like are major factors in why this can fail or thrive.

Okay my first point was learning from comfort of your home, now this is really a pro and a con in a lot of ways, the reason i say this is because some people can sit at their house and be comfortable and not be distracted or become complacent. But for myself I know that my household is my hiatus from the real world so I'd probably abuse the fact that i was at home instead of being in an environment with the soul purpose of teaching and instruction. But, in that same regard you could argue that being home for some kids would make them more confident and feel as though being home isn't a distraction but a safe space for them to be able to learn and not have to be subject to everyone else making them uncomfortable.

The second point i had was that you'd never really socially have any interactions with kids your own age, which in my opinion you need to do. I feel like there is a small percentage of the world who have become sheltered and have evolved into what is nicknamed a "homebody". And school is where you discover what you like and dislike not just in learning but also in people, you either make long lasting relationships, or you develop stepping stones to get to what you really are and what really interest you. But you can't get to really make your individuality by sitting on the couch looking at a screen and talking all the time. Sometimes you need to get out let the Sun hit your skin and talk to people and let them see and feel the real you.

Now, everybody knows that there is something called a dress code not just in school but pretty much in all areas of life: businesses, religion, parties, even down to deaths society has made a "dress code" for any and everything you could possibly think of. But when you're at home you dress and present yourself in your own way because well, YOU ARE AT HOME. There's nobody that can say for certain that they know every time that they'd get up to go to school they've always followed dress code rather it's your guardians dress code or your actual school dress code, at least i can't so i dont believe that the dress code would always be followed because you're learning from home and even if you weren't at home the dress code could still be broken.

I have one last area to address then I'm going to tell you if think this is something think "distant learning" is a good idea or not. The last factor I believe is the biggest and that is personal life being exposed over a screen; simply put your house. Now, it's been said that "not everybody lives the same, and not everybody is raised the same." Most of the time what goes on in your a very select few individuals know what goes on in your house unless you tell them or they've seen it first hand but for the most part it's hidden.

But there's no way to hide if you're over a screen with a camera that shows exactly where you are and what you are doing. I think this is the best way to let the world know what type of life you have good, or bad. Your house is where you and your family reside and nobody is going to act differently in their own house just because they're "distant learning" you know goodness well ya mamma still going be herself, your siblings are still going to be knocking and barging in your space, your father is going to yelling, pets hollering; all of these are factors that can influence and interrupt your learning.

Finally, I feel like this can be a great thing for people who have incurable diseases, or are scared of people, or who even just cant deal with the day to day get up and go to school routine. But this is not something i think that will provide you with all of the different aspects of school: learning, socialization, individuality, and just "the normal" for kids who are trying to become all they can be. I feel like going to school has saved many lives and molded many minds to becoming who they are and who they deal with on a daily basis. So yes i believe it could be beneficial in some ways but in a lot of ways it will cause many crippling agents that will handicap an individual's life mentally, physically, socially, emotionally, and spiritually.
