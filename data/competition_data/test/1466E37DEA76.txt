Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.

While using their cell phones drivers lose sight of the task at hand and stop paying attention to what they are doing. According to the "National Safety Council" "Cell phones used while operating a motor vehicle leads to 1.6 million crashes a year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from distracted driving by cell phone usage."

Well According to "Teen Safety" "Over 3,287 deaths occur daily due to a car crash."
