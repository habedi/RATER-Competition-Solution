In the text the author suggests that Venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He supports the fact that Venus is the sister planet to us and that it could have once been another earth and had all kinds of life and water on it. He proves in the text that he supports it strongly because the way things are they arn't able to conduct a thorough study and mission. They need to have a closer look and intake on the plannet to do the right amount of work needed to be done.

In the text the author plainly state's that what they are doing and how hey are studying Venus isn't effective. It would be if they where to go and despite the danger's get a closer look. He thinks strongly that the way things are they are unable to get samples and find out actuall good data on the sister planet. As it states in the text "More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance" (Paragraph,6). This shows that the author believes that it is important to get closer in on the the planets survice to conduct the proper evaluation and tests.

The author feels as though it is worth the while to try and work around these dangers. He feels this planet has alot to offer them on as far as information goes. That their is a good possibility that this planet could have been another earth. As it shows in the text "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system" (Paragraph, 4).This goes to show that because of the planet possibly being an old earth It makes the research more valuable.

The authore suggests that Venus is worth the dangers to get a good look at what really lays along the surfice. He supports this strongly believing that Venus is a sister planet and could have once even been another earth. He shows in the text that he supports this strongly because the way things are they arnt able to get a good read on things their that they arn't close enough. To him getting closer means getting more in tell and samples. They need to have a closer look on the planet to get better evidence and facts support behind if this planet really used to be a earth once. That is why he strongly supports it and thinks it's worth the risk it could help better earth since its our sister planet.
