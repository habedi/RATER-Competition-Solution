I do think this could be helpful in many ways, and could help in many ways. It's crazy what some technology can do now days. I think this could be used in a lot of mental and health situations if people are wanting help. This could help the doctor with these problems. But if they start using this in schools and things like that it might not work out as well. Thats just because some kids may not want that or parents.

I don't think this would be very helpful in a classroom. I don't see how it would work and help the school out or anyhing. Unless they are trying to track kids mental and emotional health. And this program is proabably a lot of money to have on computers. Some schools they can spend their money on better things for the kids of the school. Personal I just don't think it could help schools unless they have the program and are using this program for learning perposes.

Yes some schools and collages will use this for learning topics and other things for the kids to learn off of. But other than schools then school the only people I could see having this is like doctors or hospitals. It would be cool in the future if this could turn into a thing for animals and we could see their emotional and mental health. We would be able to see what like dogs or cats are thiking if they are happy or sad.

But this could be bigger in the near future and maybe could help a lot of people. I just don't see how it could help with anything that much. But everything usally has a reason why it's made and it will be used by some people with certain jobs with stuff like this. The big thing on it is it really could help with people that have emotional problems or i guess mental problems too. Or if someone is depressed real bad or something like that.
