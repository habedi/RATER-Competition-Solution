Some schools allow students to take their classes from the comforts of their home, but is that a beneficial way for them to learn? A student can learn from many ways, but learning from their house they are more prone to distractions, skip classes easier, and not have the full experience of having to be at a workplace working with other people.

This option of learning can be beneficial to some students. Kids who work or have to take care of a younger sibling, may find this method to be easier for them to find time for their school work or their work outside of school. In some cases, a kid could be expected to be the grown up at home and be the one responsible of taking care of their family. Learning online could help them a lot, since they would be at home watching over things and be able to find more time for their job.

Taking classes at home can lead a student to be distracted more easily. The fact that at home, a student has all of their electronics and accessories available to them, makes this idea more likely to happen. A student could be on their phone or even be watching TV the whole time they are taking this online class. Distractions can occur more frequently if a student takes online classes.

A student taking an online course can skip class much more easily. If you have ever tried to skip class in school, you would know that the school's staff would most likely prevent that from happening. So, who would prevent that from happening if a student took online classes? Knowing how most parents go to work during school hours, a kid could easily miss their online class and makeup an excuse later. Skipping class could be easier for a student taking online classes.

If a student took online courses, they would not get the full experience of working with others in a workplace. Working with others is something important that a student should learn in school. Many jobs out there require you to work with other people to get something done. Going to school can help you get comfortable with communicating and working with other people. It is an ability you would not really get from sitting behind a computer at home. Working with others is something you will most likely learn by attending school.

The option of taking classes at home is not beneficial to students. At home a student can experience more distractions, be able to skip class more easily, and not really learn how to work with others in a workplace. The choice of taking your classes at school would benefit a student more.
