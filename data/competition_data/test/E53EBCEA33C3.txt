Dear Principal,

I disagreed with your new almost your new policy you are about to make. You are not giving the student a chance. You should make it or even at lease a C or a D. So they can bring there grades up and make the school a better place to stay at.

If you didn't do that your own student will hate and even move away from you. So the student can at lease live there dreams or even live how to be on a team. Team work is very important to the school it even help the student grades to go up a lot. I will agree to make a C grade so they will start to listen.

Most of the school will exceed on there aims and maybe be in the newspaper that this is the most school that exceed on there aims tasting score . You really don't want to mess up some student life up and throwingit the trash. So it will be the best thing to do and make the change in the grades and really" do you to crush there life and stop them from playing sports ?"More student will give the school respect and even you.

A c will be the best thing to do to do to your school and there grades so make your choice. Change your school and make it a butter place to learn at. Make them feel like there are at home and not in trouble at home.

Sincerely: to the principal
