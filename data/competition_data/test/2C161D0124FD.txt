From Lukes point of view saying that he wanted people to join participate is that in the begging of the story it said that Luke was working at a grocery store and at a bank. his friend named Don Resit invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke said yes because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In 1945 world war ll was over in Europe and a lot of countries were left in ruins. so that sentence can tell you that if you participated you could help fix countries.

44 nations joined together to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation.

In August 1945 they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived there on August 14th.

Luke was 18 when he arrived in Greece. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. when Luke was helping out on his aunt Katies's farm it had prepared him for hard work. Luke also found time to have fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been housed.

Luke did a lot of things on his free time like, Table-tennis tournaments, fincing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. But being a seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. it lead his family to host a number of interrnational students and exchanged visitors for many years. Luke bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War ll. So I think that from Lukes point of view he might have wanted people to participate in the seagoing Cowboys because it might be nice to help our countries and support us and also to help others around the world who needs help. That's what I think is coming from Luke Bomberger point of veiw.
