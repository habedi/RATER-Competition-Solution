Dear Principal,

I believe that students should be required to perform community service at one point of there life. They all need to participate because they live in this community to. Even some Elementary Schools are tutoring children and others to clean up litter. The kids think that helping the community is very important to everyone. But others think community service is a waste of time and effort and takes away time that they could use other things. What they under stand is that they live in the same community as everyone else and they need to contribute to what is right for everyone. They should take some time and really think about what the outcome could be if everyone participated in the community to help clean up a little bit and make it a more presentable community to live in and not nasty and gross with garbage every where they go.

There should be participation every where to try to clean up communities every where. The communities should not be dirty. They should be clean so there is no pollution in the air. The schools should be clean and sanitary for everyone around.

The teachers should make sure that there is no trash and dirt or anything that can pollute the school.

Sincerely,

Students Name
