Driverless cars could be a good thing, I totally agree with them. People wouldnt get into as many recks and the other person couldnt really blame it on them for crashing. As shown on TV and in movies they look really cool. These cars would use half the fuel they use now and are far more flexible than buses. Even though they would need a lot of work to accomplish and a lot of time, they could really work out.

Driverless cars would need a lot of sensors, cameras, GPS, etc. I would imagine they would cost a lot of money because that is a lot of electronic things put into one car to make it amazing. Although some cars already have sensors in them, they still dont cost as much as everything else that needs to be put into them. They could help the drivers out more than they can manage alone. There would be less recks, less cops on duty and less money paid to the state.

Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the driverless cars, but technology is so far now that it is starting to catch up to reality. GM has developed seats that vibrate when your about to be in danger. In some cars we have now, the camera beeps when we are too close to someone or something. To me that helps out with a lot of people who are too short to see or dont pay attention. It tells you when you need to take over and put your hands on the wheel. Even though they're called "Driverless Cars" you still need to be paying attention and not texting and driving because it might not work like you think it does. You still could crash or hit someone or something. Don't take your eyes off the road!

I totally agree with the Driverless Cars, they could set us high up and keep us safe! The human driver should have control the whole time they are driving, and should pay attention. Who knows if the sensors really work? We've been working to get cars like this for a really long time and will hopefully have them by 2020.
