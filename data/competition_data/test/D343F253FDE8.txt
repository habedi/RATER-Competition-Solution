School has many extracurricular activities. Such as sports, clubs, councils, and more. Although these activities sound amusing and fun, some kids might not like it or find any interest in them. Maybe they want to go home or hang out with friends like a pack of wolves. I disagree with the decision of making students participate in after school activities because some kids wouldn't be interested, they may have other things to do, and they want to have time to spend with family.

When some kids do sports or other activities, they may start to lose interest. Take Basketball or Football for example, most kids and adults love playing or watching the sport on TV. But to some kids when they play or watch it, the interest in that sport will start to go away because of the repetition that's going on in the game. The reason behind this is because kids find other things for amusement. For instance, art. Art gives kids the ability to let their imagination run free and create wonderful pictures and ideas for a comic or art picture. Plus, kids can have fun with drawing instead of staying at school longer for an activity that has no interest to them.

Most of the time students have backpacks that are filled with homework and are expected to complete it by tomorrow. The problem with that is most students are participating in an after school sporting event or have something else going on, which will make the student to feel stressed. Feeling stressed occurs when a child or adult starts to panic due to the time they have and how much work they are required to do. Because of the amount of homework they have, some students will stay up through the night in order to complete the work for the day. Also, due to the students staying up at night working on homework, they don't get the required sleep that a person needs to have before the next day. Which is why some students don't want to do extracurricular activities, they want to get the homework out of the way so they can do whatever they want for the rest of the day.

Kids want to try to spend as much time as they can with their family all the time. whether if they have a little bit of homework or it's a free day. Because most parents are working people and have to travel most of the time, so when the kids get off the bus to go home, they're most likely to be home alone because their parents are still working. Or they are out running errands before they get home. Plus, when the kids get to their parents after a long day, they to try and spend as much time as they can before the parents' children become teenagers and leave the house for college. Like a life cycle of a duck, the baby ducks try to stay with their mommy before they grow into adult ducks and go out on their own.

I disagree with the decision of making students participate in after school activities because some kids wouldn't be interested, they may have other things to do, and they want to have time to spend with family. Students should be able to choose if they want to take part in an after school activity or not participate in one. Students of all ages have their own interests and other activities they find amusing. Because everyone is different, have different ideas, and do different things on their free time. In conclusion, students should be able to choose if they want to do an after school activity or not and not have a requirement of doing an extracurricular activity.
