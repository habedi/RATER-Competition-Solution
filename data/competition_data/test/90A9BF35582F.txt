Dear Principal:

I believe that the first policy would be the best choice. Policy One states that students are allowed to use their phones during lunch and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class. This policy would be the correct choice for you to make. Children mainly use phones in class because they want to feel like they have freedom. This policy would be the best choice due to a couple of reasons in specific. Kids want to have freedom, communicate, and make sure an emergency doesn't occur.

Kids at school want to have freedom. They want to feel like they aren't overly burdened and under super strict government. Just like the original founders of our constitution, most want to be free and have privacy and other benefits while still learning at school. With the use of phones in free time, they will be able to accomplish freedom. They can text or call or go on the internet during their spare time. This is a huge reason to chose policy number one.

Students want to be able to communicate. Some kids aren't able to see all of their friends to due to conflicting schedules and areas. A kid may be on the other side of the school as another, but cell phones, they can still communicate to each other. Communicating can help students a lot by preparing them. Kids can tell each other what they will do in a class and/or what their homework is. With the use of technology, kids can basically talk to their entire school with the touch of a button.

The most important reason to use cell phones during school is to prevent emergency. Kids have homes and property that belong to their family. With the use of a cell phone, kids can get messages from a parent telling them if they are needed for help or anything. An emergency may also be avoided at the school. If a child sees a fire but is unable to get to a fire alarm, he/she may call the local fire department. This could possibly save the school.

Cell phones would play a big role in kids lives. With the help of a cell phone, kids have instant access to anything the need. As long as they aren't being used during class, Policy One is the correct choice. I really hope you consider and accept my proposal and chose policy number on.

Sincerely,

Student
