Dear Principal,

My ideas and thoughts about community service is that it's very important, not only to us students, but to our community as well. I think you should require all students to perform community service because helping out the school just by picking up trash should be something that each child should feel obligated to do.

Just by picking up a few pieces of trash scattered around the school can simply make a better environment for students and fellow classmates.

Many students may enjoy picking up trash because they have the same thoughts and feelings towards community service as I do. Picking up trash at our school can be done by just spending a few minutes out of our recess or lunch time. By doing so, your can encourage other students just by your actions. At first, there might not be many students willing to help out the school and its community. It might start off small, but you can enlarge the amount of students participating by starting a club with many fun events the children can do.

On the other hand, there might be other students who think that simply picking up trash is a big waste of time, where they can either play with friends or do other activities. You can start by making bright and fun posters and putting them around the school that can encourage students and make them think that it is the right thing to do. You can also host an event where you can give out prizes to the students who have picked up the most amount of trash around the school, their homes, or just anywhere.

Community service is a great thing to do. It not only helps the school, it can make a student feel better about themselves and know that they did something great. Community service just by picking up trash can encourage students that they can do something bigger and bigger to help the environment and our surrounds.
