The electoral college is not really a college. The electoral college consist of 538 electors but the majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the president. Each person running for persident in our state has his or her ownÂ  group of electors, but are they even relivent to elections. Why should we have a electoral college? tyhe answer to that is no theres no piont in having a electoral college.

Accoording to "Source 2: the indefensble electoral college..." by Bradford Plumer "The single best argument against the electoral collage is what we might call the disaster factor." state legislatures are technically responsible for pivcking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Plumer stated " back in 1960 segergationist in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors whith new electors who oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy.)" segergationist are liberal or conservative: political phlosophies commonly seen as opposite each other. The electoral college has had mant problems of things happening reliying on the presidental elections.

Perhaps most worying in the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote Plumer said "In that case, the election would would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would chose the vice-president.) because each stat casts only on vote, the single representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representative from California, who represent 35 million voters."which is much more simpler that have a electoral college expecially when they have had many problems in the past with it.

The most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. In source 2 its states "bececause of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states. alot opf people dont even get to see the ads .

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. we as the people should be able to get ride of it. It should no loger be in use we should abolish the electoral college.
