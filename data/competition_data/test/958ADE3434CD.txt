Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you, in concern of whether we should do community service or not. I believe that we should community service. We should do this because it helps other people and the world. Also it really would get our school notice because of what great thing we are doing.

Most students would say that community service is a waste of time. They say that because they don't really know the reason why they are doing this. Maybe if they do something fun and exciting they would do it. You should really encourage kids to do this because they will feel like they accomplish something and feel better about themselves. I believe if you get a certain amount of kids, more kids will join because those kids will how amazing it is to be ib community service.

The other reason why we should do community service because it's all about helping others. Helping people is rewarding because the person you're helping it would mean the world to them. Also imagine how you would feel after
