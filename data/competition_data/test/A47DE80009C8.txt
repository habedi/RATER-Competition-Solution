Sports, yearbook, and clubs are all after school activities. They all help you get involved in your community and school. Being a part of an after school activities is awesome because you can meet new friend and have fun. Some people dont like getting involved in after school activities, but what if you had to be involved in at least one because the principal makes you; So would you agree of disagree with this rule. I would agree with this rule because getting students involved in an after school activity is a good thing it can teach them leader ship and they can also make new friends. they are also be active by being a part of an after school activity keeps them off the couch.

When part of an after school activity students can develop leadership and new skills. by being part of a school sports team students can learn leadership and they can stay active. if you are the best player on you chess club team then you can help the other people in the club and help them get better.

When you are a leader on the football field like a quarter back you need to be paying attention at all times. The can also help in the classroom because you could also learn how to pay attention in class more. no mater the activity you are apart of you can allows learn something new and learn how to be a leader.

Being part of an after school activity can help you become more active and even loose a couple of pounds. if you are on a school sports team you can stay active. Even if you are only going to a ports team conditioning most of the time every school sports team does something to stay active and stay in shape, and even after the season is over you can still stay active and exercise on you own so you can be ready for next season. being on a school team you can do and learn so much from your coaches and you can even learn a few things on your own.

When you are part of an after school activity you can meet new people. If you cant make any friends at school then you could join in an after school activity and make a hole lot of friends. If you never try and make friends you will just be only all the time and have no one to hang out with and goof around with, But if you do get involved in an after school activity you can make friend s and maybe even if lasting friendships with people that went to the same school as you you would just never talk to anyone. So being a part of a school activity could change your life.

So that is the reason why I agree with making everyone be a part of at least on e after school activity they can accomplish so much. I just think that not being part of an after school activity what would you do. Joining an after school activity wont heart anything it will only help you it will help you learn leadership and new skills. It can also help you find new friends that you might end up hanging out with all the time.
