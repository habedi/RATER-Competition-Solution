When I participated in the Seagoing Cowboys program I was allowed to explore and learn about new things. This program is an opportunity of a lifetime, here are the reasons why I think you should take this wonderful opportunity of a lifetime.

Taking this opportuniy had opened up a whole new world for me. I think you should join because you get to see unbelieveable historic buildings, sculptures, and you even get to visit old towns that have water for roads! Another reason that I thought was cool was to help other people in need and even only if you help one person you feel like a hero, this is the whole point of this program. You also get some free time, you do not have to work 24-7, for example " The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the emptyholds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tornaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games had also helped pass the time." The learning of the awareness also opens up opportunities to host and run facilities about this issue of people in need.

I think these are some of the reasons why other people should join the Seagoing Cowboy program. You can learn a lot from this program. I think you should sign up for this program it would change your life just like it did mine.
