For many years, there has been a disconnection between students and teachers; part of this is due to the fact that some students simply just do not like the taching methods of the teachers they have been assigned to, but what if that could change. Recently, a new technology has been developed that is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology enables computers to identify a variety of human emotions. This system could accomplish many great things. If used in schools as personal tutors for students, many things could change for the better.

Imagine getting an A+ on every single one of your geometry quizzes because you actually knew what was going on. If the Facial Action Coding System is incorporated into a tutoring program, this could enhance the students knowledge of their prefered learning styles. If a student is learning a lesson in a class and FACS picks up that the student is not enjoying the way it is being taught to them or simply looks disinterested, FACS could continue to bring the lesson to the student until the student looks satisfied. The student would finally understand how to solve something in a way that they like meaning this would be a win for both the school and the student. This is just one of many ways that FACS could be used in classrooms across the world, potentially enhancing them.

With the evedince shown above, it has been shown how useful it would be to incorporate a Facial Action Coding System in schools. It would be a smart choice to have something that connects with a students emotions when it comes to learning something new. This would not only mean a higher success rate for schools, but also the student would be satisfied in knowing that they understand how to do certain things that they did not prior to FACS.
