I dont not feel driverless cars are needed,because driverless cars are only going to make humans more and more lazy. There not safe for the driver or for the pedestrians. If the was to be a crach or the car were to hit someone who would be resonable the buyer to the car or manufacturer of the car? These are just some of the thing that could go wrong that the artical has pointed out.

There are also thing the artical didnt say like how meny job there getting rid of by making the cars driverless. There are job like taxi-drivers; bus-drivers; lemo-drivers and semi-dervers all out of jobs. Then you have people who aren't comterble not being the one driving and get car sick. What happend if theres ice on the ground and the car reads the spead limit as 60mps. It may break, but its going to slid and hit something or someone. There's also the fact what if someone doesn't have a driverless car and there trying to run a red light a human that was driving might be aware and stop, but someone in a driverless car are more likely not to see it because there mor then likely texting or playing on the phone then watching the road. Then there's a huge crash. These are someone of the little things no one thinks about because people think the more lazy we're able to be then the better off the world is, but its not.

I can see all the good things that can come of driverless cars but bad thing weight out over the good things. There isn't a way to be sure of the safty of drivers, pedestrians, and property. To meny things can go wong that if there was a human driver if wouldn't happen. Thing like driving slow in rain and snow or even being able to pay attention to the road the someone with the money to buy a driverless car is trying to run a light. I feel if we can't garanteed the safty of all perple animals and property around us im not for driverless cars.
