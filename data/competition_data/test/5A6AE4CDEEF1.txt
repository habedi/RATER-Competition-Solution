The school bus doors close with a hiss behind you as you walk down your driveway. You enter your house and sigh with boredom. Once again, the rest of your family is out participating in activities, and you are left alone at home with nothing to do. This situation has occurred to many people that don't participate in any extracurricular activities. I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students will be able to meet new people, find a new passion, and it gives them something to do.

If you are looking to meet new people, joining an extra curricular activity is a great way to do it. It is easier to make friends with people whom you share common interests with. So, it will be less difficult for you to talk to someone who has joined the same club as you because all of the people in that club at least share the common interest of the subject of the club. Participating in the same activity and being in the same room encourages you to talk to people. When I am at swim practice, I am encouraged to talk to the people in my lane because we are swimming together for one and a half hours, so why not get to know them? Because of this, I have made new friends outside of school, and I regularly spend time with my new friends outside of swim practice as well. Meeting new people is only one benefit of extracurricular activities, however, there are many more.

It is hard to discover hidden passions if you don't try new and different activities. Through these new activities, you could discover that you have a strong interest in robotics that you were not aware of before. If you find an activity that you are passionate about, your life will be much more exciting and enriching. It can also help you figure out what type of career you want to pursue when you grow up. Naturally, people will want to pursue careers that are related to subjects they are interested in. So, it will be much easier for you to decide because you have discovered your passions and talents at an earlier age. My father signed me up for theatre one year, and when he first told me, I was apprehensive. I am naturally a shy person, so I didn't think that I would enjoy being on stage in front of a large crowd of people. But, I ended up really enjoying the whole experience and participated in that theatre camp for three more years. Also, when I first started taking piano lessons, I thought that it would be a huge waste of time. But, I found that I was quite talented at playing the piano, and I enjoyed creating music that my family and friends would loved listening to. Extracurricular activities help you uncover new passions, and they also provide you with something to do.

Participating in an extracurricular activity is a productive way to use your time. Many students come home and waste time on the internet or social media because they have nothing better to do. There is nothing worse than coming home and finding out that your child spent four hours watching a cartoon on TV. An activity would give them something to think about or allows them to spend their time somewhere productive. When I have nothing to do at home, I play the piano because it is a great way for me to use excess time and I enjoy doing it. On the days that I am not at swim practice, I would feel like I have too much time on my hands. But, I have other extracurricular activities scheduled for those days. like meeting with my math team or piano lessons, which prevent me from experiencing painful boredom. These are only a few reasons why students should participate in extracurricular activities, and it can be seen that there are significant benefits.

In conclusion, students should participate in extracurricular activities because they give you something productive to do, they help you find new passions, and allow you to meet new people. Every student should choose one extracurricular activity to participate in because of the plentiful benefits these activities provide. Suddenly, you realize that today was the first day of track practice, and you frantically call you friend, asking them if they can come pick you up and bring you back to school. When they arrive, you hurriedly jump into their car and anxiously wait during the drive back to school. Once you are finally there, you burst out of the car and hurry down to the track. Luckily, the coach only just started with stretches, so you put down your bag and stretch with the rest of the team. Throughout the rest of practice, you laugh with a new friend whom you would have never met if you didn't join the track team.
