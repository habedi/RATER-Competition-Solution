Kids now a days are so lazy to get out of bed they stay home and get the job done.

I believe students will benefit from distance schools because they have a more controlled home schedule and also they get to spend more time with family.

Students have more controlled and balanced schedule at home. They get to do things more independently. The more independent you are the more successful you are. You get to do other things around the house you might of forgotton about and learn at the same time. Multi-tasking can help you get your duties done a lot quicker.

Scholars get to spend more time with family. In some situations while kids go to school parents stay home and then when the kids get home from school the parents go to work. Quality family time is super valuable and important that some families dont get to have that. Scholars have supporting, depending families at home that can help you. You get learn more about your family the more quality time you spend with them.

Students will not gain any school experiences from being home in a computer all day. You would be missing on school activities like your senior prom. You only get to have one of those big dances a year that you would miss and could never get back. Students would miss there elementary, middle and high school experience that you cant relive again. School is a big part of who you are and what helps you grow along the way.
