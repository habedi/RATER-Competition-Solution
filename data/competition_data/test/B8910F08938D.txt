It would be a great thing to move into Venus for all humans because some point the Earths surface or the Orbit of the Earth would be destroyed that it would possably bring to kill millions of people around the world, or it'd be easier to say that humans will most likely be extinct for ever. I see that it's a worthy, right, & brave to be doing reasearch, tests, & ect. on Venus when it might be a bit dangerouse because there are just millions of babies, kids, parents, and grandparents around the world that it would be awefull to see them die at a very young age, I don't see that it's a right thing for humans to suffer the pain and to see their last memory of there loved ones dying. Venus has had water before in its planet, so i believe that if venus has had water, it would be possable to bring & to be having plants, anilmals, and living things to be working together in Venus so that it's capable, possable of growing a new nation, and developing more people.
