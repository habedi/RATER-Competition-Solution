I think that the Facial Action Coding system sounds really cool and unique but I don't know if I fully agree with the being able to read the emotional expressions of students in a class room because I defintley feel like It would take alot more work than just a simple computer program and a computer. The reson why I would say I don't fully agree with that is because I feel like somethings are good without having technology and today alot of teachers know when your sad,borad,happy,mad and so on. But the main thing is with this is somthing I wouldn't wanna take away from friendships because I feel like a lot of good friends can always or always know when you are sad or mad and things like that and your friends could also help you through that. Another thing is that I feel like if a kid gets confused I feel like thats why there are teachers there in the room to help and be able to personally walk through physical and mentally be able to help him them, also I think that most of the kids would understand a little bit better than what they would with the helping of an instructor on the computer. But I really do think that it sounds like a really cool idea its just that some of that stuff you don't wanna take away from the actual feelings part or help from others.
