Community service

I think community services is necessaries because some kids just throw things on the floor and that in my opinion is bad manners. Some kids don't know what littering can do to our planet. Or kids don't have to pick up trash they can do what i did, go to a local school or your old elementary school and help out. I did it for 4 months 2 months at a time. Doing community services will make you feel good and people will think of you as more of a good person. I think that everybody in the whole school should do 20 hours of community service. No matter if it is at school or pick up trash or even helping out around the house if u don't already do that.

Some kids don't want to do it because it is kind of boring but it is all ok and fun in the end. Think about it u helped out some one that really did need it. It is better than sitting at home all day doing nothing or just watching television. The only thing is that when can you do it. Well after school help out at your old school by helping the after school program. Or some thing like that.

There are some many different ways of community service. You can help out you next door naboheir or you can help out at school or you can simply help someone take there food to the car, when your at the grocery store.

So if u want to do community service these are examples of thing you can do. these are also reasons why i think we should do atleast 20 hours of community service.
