Dear Principal,

I feel that cleaning up the community is a good way to keep the community clean. It is a good idea to get the kids involved, but I don't feel that all the kids should have too. Some kids don't have the time and effort to do those kind of activities. For example, some kids might have to do an outside activity, like sports, and don't want to take time out of doing fun activities. Maybe they don't have enough time during the day to do even those things.

I am on a basketball team myself I don't have enough time after school to do my homework. Plus during my free time, I like to do things with my friends. If you want kids to be cleaning up the community, have the ones that volunteer. Sometimes cleaning up the community isn't such the best thing to do. A school shouldn't have to worry parents that their kids have to clean the community and be at a certain place at a certain time. parents should let their kids pick if they want to clean the community. Parents should teach to pick up after themselves, but not to clean others trash forcefully.

Some kids will want to clean a community. I say that you, as the principal, should take a vote on what to do. I'll just say that I don't have the time to clean the community, but others might, so let the kids decide. If they decide not to clean the community, then let the kids at school decide on what to do with the community and go from there. Don't take my advice, I am just an opinion. Just make sure to do what's right for the kids.
