I disagree with this decision. There are various reasons students shouldn't be required to take extracurricular activities. Students have responsibilities after school like, babysit, jobs, tutoring, and extracurricular activities can make students tired and less focused. if a student has to do an extracurricular activity it can take time away from their responsibilities.

Some students have to babysit their younger siblings or other family members after school. If they're required to take an extracurricular activity they wont be able to babysit and the child will go to some other care that costs a lot of money. If the student cant babysit then the parent will have to find someoneÂ else which can result in less money for food and other nessicities. It also makes less time for the parent to work just because they have to make sure that their child is getting the care they need and to make sure the child isn't getting neglected.

Another reason extracurricular activities aren't a smart idea is, some students have jobs and have to work after school. Sometimes students have to gets jobs to help support their family because their parents aren't making enough. If they have to do an extracurricular activity it can result in the student working later, and they can be less focused and tired during school. If students aren't focused in school they can get bad grades and eventually flunk out of school.

After school some students have to do tutoring or get help with certain classes so they don't fail. Extracurricular activities take time out of tutoring and gives the student less time to get help. Students should be able to have a brief tutoring session so they can understand what they're doing and pass. They shouldn't have to take time out of their tutoring just to do an extracurricular activity. They should be open to the help they need and be able to pass.

Extracurricular activities can make students excessively tired and stressed. Students already stress enough about school, they shouldn't have to stress about an extracurricular activity too. Sometimes sports or whatever the student is doing can make the student very tired and can run very late at night so they get less sleep and aren't focused in school which can make them fail. It can also result in students sleeping in class and not learning anything the teacher is teaching.

In conclusions i think making students do extracurricular activities is a bad idea. Some students babysit, have jobs, do tutoring or the activity can make them tired, stressed, and unfocused. Students shouldn't have to take extracurricular activities. I think that once a student gets out of school they should be able to take care of their responsibilities and not have to worry about an extracurricular activity.
