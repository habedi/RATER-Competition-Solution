In school, students can participate in a wide range of extracurricular activities like sports, science and everything in between. The principal has made a decision that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and for good reason. Students can learn many things from these activities, they can improve on social skills and cooperation with one another, and they can engage in a fun experience that will help them grow.

Students can learn many things from extracurricular activities, such as programming or acting. Students are preparing for the world ahead of them, and activities like these enable students to get a head start on their goals for the future. Students also learn valuable life skills from these activities like cooking and sewing.

Students are able to improve their social skills and cooperation with their classmates, not only their learning prowess. Being in a team or in a club of some sort allows students to grow friendships and connections with each other, improve team building skills and expand on communication.

Students, regardless of the activity they choose to be a part of, can engage in a fun and worthwhile experience that will help them grow as people. Students can be a part of something they love and branch out their experiences, try new things and enjoy what they've worked for.

Regardless of students participating in one activity or three, the reward is still the same. Students learn all kinds of things from extracurricular activities, they can branch out to new horizons and grow as people. Students are preparing for the world ahead of them, and extracurricular activities can help them get a head start in the real world even if they are a part of just one thing.
