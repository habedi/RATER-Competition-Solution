Hi my name is Luke and there are a ton of reasons to go on Seagong Cowboys Program, and there all right here. Just keep reading and the only thing that you would want to do is go on that trip.

Oh how much fun that was on that boat with all of the lovely animals and my friends.

One of the best things about the trip was all the friends I made, you know playing games and stuff.

I know what you're thinking; what about all of that hard work the whole time.

Well on the way back the only thing that we did was play games, read, and everyonce in a while we would have to clean off the docks.

There were no animals on the way back and thats why it was so fun.

On the way there it was pretty hard work taking care of the animals, but we only had to that every hour, and even then we all pitched in and helped.

If you're thinking about how long it took, it really just depends on how fast you work.

There in't really much to say about the work that hasnt been said, the point is it's not that hard.

The best part about the trip was all the places that we stopped at along the way.

One of the best ones was when we stopped at Greece and I saw the Acropolis.

We also stopped at Vince Italy, the city had streets of water.

We also visited Europe and China, plus im even including the fact we helped so many people along the way.

This is the best thing that could have happened to a small town boy like me.

The only reason why I got to go on this amazong trip was because of one of my friends told me about it.

I guess I'm just trying to be a good friend to and give you the life changing trip.

Just think about it.

All that I'm really trying to say is that this is the most amazing that happened to me and it all I had to do was take care of a couple of animals with my some of my closest friends.
