Cell Phones

A family decides to have a little fun on a Sunday afternoon so they all jump in the car and drive off to a shopping center. As the dad is driving he receives a text from his boss and decides to take a quick look at his phone to respond to his boss. As the dad was trying to make an innocent text, he was unaware that he ran a red light. Screams, screeches, and shatters is all that was heard as the family's car was hit by an eighteen wheeler. This scenario is a major example of what could happen if it was legal to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.

When using a phone while driving a person is visually, physically, and mentally distracted from the task at hand which is operating a motor vehicle. When making an executive decision to pick up a cell phone, both hands are not on the steering wheel.

The United States law states that unless someone is changing gears or putting on signals, they must have both of their hands on the steering wheel at all times .While looking at the phone, people are visually distracted which causes their eyes to be focused on whatever they are looking at and not on the road . The mind is officially concentrated on what is happening on the cell phone when it should be focused on driving safely.

Making decisions for other people by using cell phones while driving is selfish. Why cause problems and danger just to use a cell phone for a few minutes? Many people are risking other people's lives by not taking the responsible route when it comes to the appropriate time to engage in cell phone activity.

There are many ways to insure that a phone cannot be distracting while concentrating on driving. One of the many things that can be done is silencing the phone. This will decrease the level of distraction when someone texts or calls. Another thing is to try to keep the phone out of reach and keep both hands on the steering wheel. There are other things as well as apps that prevent you from using your phone while a car is in motion. These are all ways to make sure that a cellular device isn't the cause of an accident.

When having the privilege to drive, one of the many things people must be willing to do is drive safely by following the laws and rules set in place to help do that. The lack of obedience towards the law can cause serious harm to others. Driving while distracted by any mobile device can cause serious consequences for the driver and others on the road. Children, families, and loved ones could be affected by this simple act of insubordination. Many people in the world receive a call saying that their loved one died because they or someone else wasn't paying attention and got hit because they didn't look up in time to notice anything.

Driving is dangerous in general, but with a phone it is like playing Russian roulette with people who didn't ask to play. We should take the high road and put the phone down while driving and if something is that important than get to a safe place to use it.
