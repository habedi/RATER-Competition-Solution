It is so hard to believe that our world today has come to cars that can drive themselves, or drive around for us humans. The future is here and it's time to quit holding these new inventions off and time to start accepting that the worlds technology today is limitless. People in our world today are becoming so intellegent that they can invent anything they set thier minds to.

First of all, if these car companies have been working on cars that can drive themselves since the 1900's, why should they stop now? Is giving up really worth throwing away 70+ years of hard work and dedication towards inventing smart cars that can drive themselves? NO, don't give up, continue to strive for a better and also safer future for the world today and generations to come.

Additionally, not only are these cars really cool and mind blowing, but very helpful to certain people. Imagine someone who has no arms, legs or even a disability that keeps them from driving and thier dream is to be able to drive a car one day, or even just to be able to sit in the drivers seat of an actual moving vehical. Well, with these new cars, their dreams can come true.

Finally, safety is the major key for these vehicals. No one is going to want to buy these vehicals or even be in one, if they aren't safe. As soon as companies make sure that these vehicals are 100% safe for families to be in and drive without the risk of a bad injury, there is no doubt that people will be all over these new cars.

The worlds future holds many more great inventions that either haven't been thought of, or are being carefully worked on and studied right now. There is no doubt that these cars are the next big thing. So many people will be inspired to create more things if they know someone could create a safe vehical to drive itself, then they can create an invention even better.
