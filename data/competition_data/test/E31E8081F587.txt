Dear TEACHER_NAME,

We, the student of SCHOOL_NAME, most certainly should take part in community service.

It's important for teenagers to understand how to help others, and not just think of ourselves.

Teens are selfish and they need to see how those who are less fortunate have it.

For example, the Thirty Hour Famine.

We could give up food for thirty hours, as a fundraiser, and give the money to a homeless shelter.

Homeless people don't have the money for food.

We take eating and shelter for granted.

Why do we do this when there are people out there who are starving and thirsting to death?

The Thirty Hour Famine would be a great way to help out.

Also, we could do something simple, such as helping with the Miracle League, for a school project.

The Miracle League is a baseball team for special needs children and adults.

They need buddies to help push wheel chairs and to just support them and help them to enjoy the game.

These children and adults often feel as if they can't do what the normal person can do.

My brother is one of these children.

Seeing how much they love it on the field, I think it would be a great way to get teens to better understand humans with special needs.

They need to understand because I often hear them insulting people with the word "retarded", and that really bugs me.

They need to see that being different isn't a bad thing.

They need to see the truth.

Community service could even be something more simple than that!

Have you ever seen the kids sitting alone at lunch?

Or even the poor children crying every day?

I fear that bullying is increasing, and children are left feeling more alone than ever.

Wouldn't you advise us to reach out and become friends with the ones that feel hated and depressed?

Suicide rates have gone up and it seems like more children are cutting themselves and relying on self inflicted pain to be a part of something.

I've had kids from SCHOOL_NAME tell me they were planning on committing suicide, and just by being a friend, I've stopped them from doing it.

I know what it's like to feel alone.

But most of the students at SCHOOL_NAME are too worried about their ego that they shrug this horrible fact off.

We need to get out there and help!

Don't you believe that teens need to quit worrying about their video game scores and their television sets in order to see what life is?

I believe that not doing community service makes teens become the selfish, lazy people they are today.

Let's reach a hand out, and be good to those in our community.

Who knows, you may even save a life.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
