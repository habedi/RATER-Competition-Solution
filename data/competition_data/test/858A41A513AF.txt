In an age where everything has become digitized, it's a wonder as to why online classes are not yet an option outside of colleges and universities. It would save so many students the stress of actually having to go to a location, without fear of being late, or the panic of feeling multiple others shoving against them in their race, or lack thereof, to get to class. However, online classes are not as wondrous as they may seem. For students, it would be more beneficial for them to just come to school, rather than video conference, as it would mean that they could talk to a teacher in real time, there would be no out-of-control distractions or incidents, and they would be able to interact with their peers freely.

Because of how unreliable Wi-Fi can often be, using a computer that needs it to access a class would not be a smart idea. It could shut off at any second, meaning the lesson would cut off with it. In a regular school environment, there would be no haywire static or buffering screens on their teachers. Rather than having to look something up that they couldn't hear and not finding anything, students will be able to ask questions and get answers straight from a reliable source. There would be no pixels to block information on a white board or Promethean either.

Being able to pick a location means that students will be able to work in an environment that suits them. Or it could mean that they are not in a controlled setting where distractions are everywhere. While students are likely to choose a place that is comfortable for them, it is likely they will choose a place that is too familiar, where the distractions are far more tempting than the actual class. There would be no way for teachers to stop rogue mothers from coming in to give their child a plate of fruit or a cup of water, as they ask how the lesson is going and proceed to talk for the next ten minutes, or a screaming match from the couple outside the library, as their argument is heard through the windows. It's best for students to be in a classroom where the occasional scream from a random student down the hall can be blocked out by closing the door or a call to the class phone can be picked up and resolved within seconds.

To be able to interact with peers in a common environment means that students can bounce ideas off each other. With online classes, classmates are often isolated from each other. Sometimes, they may not even have classmates, with one-on-one lessons. This means that the only person they would be able to talk to after class would be their teacher, who is likely busy trying to plan the next lesson. While they would be able to ask questions without fear of ridicule, they would be able to ask others in the class about assignments and notes, without revealing that they didn't understand the concept to the whole class. Projects that require partners or groups would allow group mates to talk, without being forced to wait for that one person who only replies after 7 hours. Bouncing ideas off each other is another added benefit.

Although video conferencing and online classes would be rather ideal for an introverted student, it would be far simpler to just go to class. No need to deal with faulty routers, or loud parents making lunch, or even isolation depression. Just a controlled area, where students can ask questions in real time, distractions can easily be shut out, and help can be offered by everyone at the table.
