Using this techlonogy of Facial Action Coding System would be very useful and valuable to be used in a classroom.

There's are several of reasons why It's a good idea to use this genuis technique in class.

To start off It's pretty incrible that a computer can see what emotion you are feeling. Why not use it? It'll come in pretty handy. Let's just say that a student In the class is never doing their work. They're constantly distracted and they don't show any effort. The computer can tell us what emotion the student is feeling so then that way It'll not only be helpful for the teacher to know what's going on but it'll also be helpful to the student so that the teacher helps the student not to struggle so much.

It can also help with students that are confused and aren't sure how they are feeling or mayeb they feel a lot of things at once which is very confusing a computer than can show what your feeling is a good tool. It can help you firgure out what your feeling In cas you don't know how you feel.

Same with teachers. Students can firgure out what their teacher is feeling that way they can avoid getting into trouble. If they see a teachers angry they wouldn't wanna make them more mad.

As in for students. With this cool technology it can help students find out what's going on in case they have a friend who they're worried about and they're not so sure what's going on with their friend. Well this computer can quickly help you figure out what's going on with them. Im sure your friend would really appriciate that you help them out even if it seems like they don't.

These are the reasons I think that using this computer that show what emotions you've got is simply very helpful to both students and teachers. It's a smart way in not only showing how you feel but also producing them.
