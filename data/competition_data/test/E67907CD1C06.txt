Dear Principal,

In response to the Community Service activities, I think that community service is voluntary and should not be forced to do unless you have committed a crime and are required to do hours of community service. If students are forced to take time from themselves in order to make the world a cleaner place then that is not right because this is a free Country and we should not be imprisoned to listen to everything and do everything that an authorised figure asks us to do. You can make the work extra credit. If you do not listen to this request than my friends and I will gladly go on strike, transfer, or not show up to school until this issue is resolved. The new building for SCHOOL_NAME is not finished yet and the community service will not be either if this community service is not avoided. The workers on the new building get paid and we will not and we come to school to learn not clean!

I might seem a bit outraged by this and I am because scientists are always saying we need to make the world cleaner, but Barrack Obama says that the kids are the future. I am growing up quickly and will be in High School next year, so i think i can make my own decisions when it comes to this.

You also stated that you know what my friends like and I bet that you can't even name any of them, so I know this is a fake, but at least try harder when it comes down to tricking somebody.
