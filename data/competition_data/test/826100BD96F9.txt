I agree with only if you have a B average because if the students get a lower average they shouldn't be able to participate in school sports. all the students that get a C or below shouldn't because they don't got a B average . and also if students don't get a B average . I think that that would be a great idea because if they get a low average that wouldn't be fair. And if many students have a C average then they shoudlnt get to particpate . so all those students that have a C average cant participate in the sports or other activities . So if the students that get a b they should because they got the average that they should of to participate in the sports or activities. so if all those kids that have a c average should work so they cant get a b average and then be able to get to participate in the sports or activities . so that's why they shoudlnt allow kids that get a c instead of a b. the principal should only let people that have a B instead of C . so i agree with the principal. The principal is correct because all those students that have a C should not be able to participate in sports or activities .
