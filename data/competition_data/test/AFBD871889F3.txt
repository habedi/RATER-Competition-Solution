Personaly i dont think it is very valuable. Simple things like this is what is wrong with the world because there is no way of for sure telling if it is 100% right and when people get there resolts back they are discusted of themselves. Yes, if there is a 100% guarntee that it is right i wouldnt mind knowing more about myself. Being able to read students emotions would be very good for school just to know how the kids are injoying school and how they are not. Kids would be able to get treated or put into a speical class for the emotions that shouldnt be there and would make them a happier person. The world would be a whole lot differnt if every single person was to be happy and i dont think there is a possible way for every single body on this world to be happy and i dont know if everyone is ment to.

You could cheat the system simply by acting happy and getting your face scanned and it could be completly wrong and the person just hate themselves on the inside. The classroom computer that could tell when a student is confused or bored would work fanominal when you are busy doing something you dont think about anything else and i think that would work exellent. Studentswould enjoy school more becase the teacher would change sometbhing to make it easier and more enjoyable. There are good and bad about this but its jsut my personal opinion.
