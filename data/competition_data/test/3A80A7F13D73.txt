Venus is presented as a valid candidate for exploration in the near future. The author presents evidence to support that it could be possible one, but is it worth it? As well as many positives of exploring Venus, there are just as many, if not more, negatives to this expedition. This mission seems very dangerous considering what would be taken from this research. Venus may have been like Earth in the past, but now there are too many dangers in exolring. The author does not give a convincing argument that going to Venus is worth the risk considering the dangers that are present.

One of the main risks of going to Venus is the high pressure and temperature. At a temperature of 800 degrees farenheit and a pressure that would crush a submarine, it's safe to say that traveling to Venus could be an extreme risk. The only evidence given to argue that a visit to Venus would be worth it, is the evidence that Venus used to be most like Earth and it is close by. With the evidence given there is not a strong enough argument there to convince anyone that tackling these dangers to venture to Venus would be worth it.

For the good of science and research, yes a trip to Venus would be extraordinary. However with the dangers presented in this article, there is just not a great need to put people at risk for it. Venus may be an interesting point of research for mankind and maybe it will happen one day, but right now it shouldn't be an option. The author has valid evidence that show that these obstacles can be overcome, but there is no evidence to support that these efforts are worth the risk.
