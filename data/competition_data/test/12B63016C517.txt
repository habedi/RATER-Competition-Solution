"Driverless Cars Are Coming"

In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," The author presents both postive and negative aspects of the driverless cars. Driverless cars are still not very safe. They still alert the driver to take the the wheel when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. Their illegal in most states,only a few in the United States allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars ; California, Nevada , Florida, and the District of Columbia.

Driverless cars aren't safe. You still cant juss not take the wheel ,cause at one point of time in the car you will. Manufacturers have not got everything right in the car. Driverless cars still need way more sensors. Sensors to indicate every turn and stop there is . I belive that it wasnt a very smaert idea to make a car that you cant controll. What's the point of paying all that money on a car if you cant drive it ? I just dont understand. If i had a car i wanna be able to move on go how i please. Not no one else or something controlling it .You might as well say your in a taxi, not your own car. Like now i cant wait til i get my car .Why would i wait all this time juss for it to drive by its self ? Thats why i disagree on making a driverless car.
