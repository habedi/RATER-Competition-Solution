Everyday, after school, I get my sister off the bus and watch her until my mom returns from work. I wouldn't be able to both do an extracurricular activity and watch her. Juggling both my own personal responsibilites and an extracurricular, on top of schoolwork, would be very stressful for me. I can't be expected to abandon by responsibilities for a school club. There are many reasons why I disagree with this dicision such as, people not being able to afford whatever they may be interested in, the students that stuggle with social anxiety and things lie it and the students who are already committed to something else after school.

One of the reasosn I disagree is that there are many actvities that would require money. There are students who are interested in these activities but won't be able to afford it. Those people who aren't able to afford it shouldn't have to pick something else just because they don't have the money. I know many kids who would be interested in sports but aren't able to pay the fees and by things like cleats, mitts, bats etc. Other actvities may do competitions which also require fees for them to be able to compete in them.

Secondly, there are many kids who struggle with social anxiety and other mental related things that could stop them from participating. Staying safe is a school rule and that rule doesn't go with just physical saftey but it also means that students should be and feel safe mentally too. Pushing them to do this could cause them to have an axiety attack or effect how they're dealing with their anxiety. Forcing a person that doesn't feel comfortable in social situations to participate in a group club is disregarding their feelings and their feelings should be taken into account.

Lastly, students may have their own responsibilities outisde of school. There are people, like me, who help watch their younger siblings after school. There are students who have a job that they have to go to work at school. Many people who go to our school already feel stressed trying to maintain good grades in the classes that their taking. Making a student do an extracuricular activity will just add to the stress that they may already be dealing with which can effect their emotional, mental and physical state.

In conclusion, my opinion is that students shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities. This shouldn't be a \ the principle is allowed to decide due to everyones personal reasons for not being able to do it. The reasons that could cause people to not partcipate, are that people are struggling with mental things like social anxiety, there are kids who can't afford the things they're interested in and that some students already are commited to something unrealted to school. I think that these things should stop the principal from making this decision.
