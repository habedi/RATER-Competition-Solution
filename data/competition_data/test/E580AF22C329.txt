The author talks about how Venus could have been similar to Earth many many years ago. The author says that Venus could have been exactly like Earth and how Venus could have been just like Earth when it came to supporting life. But later on in the article the author started to talk about how Venus' atmosphere is really dangerous and how its atmosphere is so dense that a person wouldn't be able to make it through there without burning up, and not that many forms of light would be able to get through the dense atmosphere either which meant no videos or pictures of Venus' ground and what it looks like. " However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective"( The Challenge of Exploring Venus 6). This proves that Venus' atmosphere is so dangerous that even if you were able to make it to Venus you wouldn't be able to go inside of its atmosphere because it is so dangerous. This also proves that since there are dense clouds formed around the inside of Venus' atmosphere you can barely see through it which means that you wouldn't be able to get any pictures or videos, and if you did manage to get a clear look at Venus' ground you still wouldn't be able to take a picture because light can't get through the dense clouds in Venus' atmosphere.
