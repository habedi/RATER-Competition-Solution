The use of the technolodgy to determine if you are happy or not is very valuable. The device can help with many things student have problems with. The people would use the device to even improve upon things they would deal with. Overall the FACS (Facial Asction Coding System) would be more of a help if looked upon the right way. It will help teachers and guidance counselors, help so students will know what to say, even just help like how to improve upon just getting along.

First off, Guidance counselors can use the machine for many things. If people were sad of angry they can help out more effectively if the counselor not sure on how the person feels. Since the passage said that," By weighting different units, the software can even identify mixed feelings." This means if they were overall sad counselors can help or if they were more angry. Teachers can use this to figure out if the student wants to be bothered or not that day so they will not call on them.

Next situation the FACS can be useful for if just student to student conversation. Some students may have a hard time trying to make friends if they do not know how other students feel. Some can be really angry or others just too sad to be talked to. Even the passage supports this by saying that," You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on her face. Of course, most of us have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy." So using the machine will help in describing if the person is having one emotion more than other emotions.

Thirdly the machine would just be a overall improvement for getting along. If people could understand how someone else felt would they just be able to connect with them better. People could have empathy for others because they knew how they feel and it would help improve upon that other person feelings. People could then cheer them up to make them smile and that smile might put them in a better mood. The passage also stated this by saying,"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may also help produce them." So understanding how someone may feel and make them happy can just make the overall feeling of the enviroment feel good.

Finally to just state if it a good idea to have a machine like this then its a obviously yes. Since they positive effects on people can help like students having a hard time and people will know what they are feeling. The boost of happiness of people would also take place in the area. There might even be less chances of fighting if someone angry and someone can finally know if they were and calm them down if they could. So a machine that determines how someone feels is very valuable even in just everday uses.
