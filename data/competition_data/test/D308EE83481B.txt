Every summer, students struggle with dreadful assignments created by teachers. These projects are supposed to enhance learning for students during their break. In reality, they are negatively affecting students. This could be mainly caused by the fact they are teacher-designed. Due to this problem, summer projects should be student-designed because it will motivate students, allow students to plan around one's schedule, and create genuine learning.

By implementing student-designed summer projects, it will motivate students in completing their tasks. Students would be able to choose something they enjoy and mold it into their projects. This would promote creativity and make learning enjoyable. Therefore, motivating students to want to complete the assignment, even during their summer break. Students would also develop more positive attitudes around the idea of summer projects. For example, they would feel less dread or pressure and instead, they would feel excitement and enthusiasm. A change in a students mood can greatly impact the completion and quality of any work on any task. Student-designed projects allows students to be able to choose something they enjoy, causing a more positive outlook on summer assignments, which will further motivate students to complete.

Another huge reason for student-designed summer projects is the ability to plan around one's schedule. Many students will go on vacation during their break, causing a lack of time to finish assignments created by teachers. By having students design their own summer projects, they could complete it before, after, or even during their vacations. This would solve a big problem for many students. Along with that, students would also benefit from student-designed projects in the long run because it will teach them how to time manage and plan. This is a key tool that will need to be used in the future and by giving students an opportunity to practice would be extremely helpful. Furthermore, student-designed projects improve time-management skills, as well as, give students a way to complete a projects under busy circumstances.

Lastly, student-designed projects also promote and create learning more than a teacher-designed project would. This is due to the fact that students could create projects that best fits their learning style. For example, if a student learns better by hearing, he could include audio into his project. This makes it easier for a student to deeply understand material to be able to complete the assignment. With teacher-designed projects many students will complete the task given; however, many times students do not care about grasping the material. They often just want to complete the assignment and get it over with. By allowing students to design their own projects, it will encourage them to retain the material. Student- designed projects not only allow for students to genuinely learn, but it also allows them to do so in a way that is best for them.

Considering how projects designed by teachers are more traditional, summer projects should start being student-designed because it will be motivating for students to complete work, allow for planning around one's schedule, and by creating real learning for students. The summer time is a chance for students to have a break from assignments given out by teachers. By giving students this opportunity, it will positively impact all of society. Not only will it bring out positive attitudes towards school, but it will inspire loads of creativity within the community and bring back the excitement of learning.
