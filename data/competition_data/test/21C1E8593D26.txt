A great many people belive that the Cydonia mesa is created by extra-terrestrial life forms or 'aliens'. While this is a very popular opnion that appears through out the media, such as books, magazines, and talk shows, it doesen't seem to have the scientific proof the back it up. The Cydonia mesa was created though natural means and there were cerntainly no aliens involved.

Some people might say that NASA would want to cover the mesa up if it was created by aliens, which make no economic sense. If extra-terrestrial life was found, NASA would get sizeable grants from the goverment to continue with the space exploration program. NASA decribed this as a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth". There was no mention of aliens.

Many imaging devices were sent to find out wether the Cydonia mesa was in fact an alien artifact. Their names were the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Orbiter Camrea, each one better than the last. Better camreas, better crews, and everyone was trying to figure out this strange land mass. This was hard, because it takes a long time to line up a camera perfectly with an orbiting, spinning planet.

Finally on April 5th of 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the mesa and snapped a picture. No aliens to be seen anywhere. Still, people weren't satisfied. They protesteted that the picture was taken in cloudly weather and thats why there were no extra-terrestials.

On April 8th of 2001, a cloudless, summer day, they flew over again and snapped a picture. In this picture it was crystal clear it was just a mesa. There were no signs of alien life and nobody was able to dispute it.

There was not one thing on that planet that even remotly pointed to the idea of extra-terrestrials on Mars. Even if there was, NASA would report it as soon as possible for financial gain. The money they would get to keep looking would be sizeable. So they decided to look, and they sent up many camreas to get photos. All those photos proved one thing. The Cydonia mesa was created though natural means and there were cerntainly no aliens involved.
