I am against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. The technology is something that for a couple of years before has evolve, and it is very advance right now; but it's not 100% dependable because is not perfect. Like the article said, "people can imitate another person's expression. I don't think that a computer is going to read someone who don't show his feelings. In my opinion it is not dependable and it is unusable.

I'll want to test one of that computers to know if that really works, but like I said, it is not dependeble. The technology is advance but it is hard to believe that a computer can read all your emotions exactly like they are. Dr. Huang said that computers need to understand that most of the human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. I don't think a computer is going to understand somthing like that.

I'm against because the technology is not 100% dependeble; technology is very useful but not very fiable. Some people can just do fake emotions and the computer is going to read it like normal I think. In my opinion it is not a good idea to use it with students, they just can express theirselfs by talking and telling what they like or what they not.
