Dear Principle,

Many Individuals in the school have an opinion on the choice you mad on the loud speaker. Students do not like the decision you have gave made. many students have a C average and the principle is taking away all there fun. I under stand the principle wants kids to work harder, but it doesn't mean the principle has to take all there fun away. students do not like this decision because the activities are all gone unless they get a B average. Every one in the school has to work harder, but the kids are trying to tell the principle that they have worked hard enough. Students come to school to do work every day but the principle takes all there activities. Activities are the only thing they have in school that is fun. the principle may think that the work is fun but it isn't.

school is to always do work and understand what they are doing. the principle thinks they students come to school for the activities but no they don't. students come to school to work hard and to be a scholar and to go college but if taking away there activities is that important then so be it. Students try there best every day in school and have work hard enough. if the school wont let you participate then go participate in a program where they have a lot of your favorite sports. changing the school policy isn't fair for the students. students try there best every day and the principle has to take all there fun away. the students need to let the mothers and fathers know for that they can all stand up to the principle. show the principle how hard you can work and prove to him that he doesn't have the right to change the school policy and to let all your activities back. Us the students shouldn't take this mans word of changing the policy we must all speak and make sure you do your best to change it the way it was. The students should let the principle know that you all worked hard enough. the principle should just wants them to work hard but the principle doesn't get that they have worked hard enough. having a C average isn't bad. the principle is crushing the kids dreams of activities. many students would have many bad things to say about the school. many parents would do anything for there child to keep succeeding and to have activities. students would love activities and the worse thing to do is to take away there activities. many students have the privileged to get a B average but what if all don't make it. don't takeaway there activities away unless getting a -C,D, or even lower then that.. you should at least give a student a chance to get there grade higher with activities. activities also count as there grade so the more activities the more B s. activities count because gym teachers can grade also so when gym teachers grade it will make there grade go higher then a C. a C+ will take it there.

Sincerely,
