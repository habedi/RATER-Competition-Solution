Summer projects should be designed by teachers and not the students. First off, when a student is on summer break, they usually don't want to do any more work than they have to, and making students design their own projects would make them less likely to complete the project. Second, a teacher designing the projects would mean that the accuracy of the project would better help the students learn as well as make the students more likely to complete the project before school starts.

When a student has to design their own project, that gives the student more work than necessary for a summer assignment. If a student is given too much freedom with the project they are more likely to procrastinate and forget about the project. For example, a student has to design their own project over the summer, but they have no idea what they should do. The student would then decide that they would figure it out later and forget about the assignment. Another reason, is that a student could be going out of town for vacation, and they wouldn't have the time to design their own project while on vacation.

Another reason teachers should design summer projects, is so that students can have detailed guidelines for their projects and learn all necessary information over the summer. If students are left to make their own project, then they are most likely going to do the minimum amount of work and gain very little of what they could be learning. If a teacher designs the project, then they could include everything that the student needs to learn for the upcoming school year while still giving the studnents a reasonable amount of work over the summer. For example, a student on vacation wouldn't have time to design and complete their own project, but if there are clear guidelines for the project, the student could complete the project around their vacation schedule.

Some people might disagree by saying that creativity would help the students in the long run, and while I beleive that creativity is a good thing, I also beleive that giving students an actual break over the summer could do a lot of good. This doesn't mean I think that students should have no work to do over the summer, but I do think that less is better in this case. The "creativity" that the students would be missing out on could easily bee made up during school hours, giving the students some breathing room over the summer.

Overall, I beleive that summer projects should be designed by the teachers, not by the students. Doing so would give the students enough work over the summer to actually retain information, but still giving them the break that they deserve. It would also give the students guidlines to work from, so that they may complete the assignment before any vacation plans that might prevent them from doing so.
