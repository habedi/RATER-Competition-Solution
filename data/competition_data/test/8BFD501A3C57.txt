NASA would like to start by saying thanks you for your interest. We find it very encouraging to see people so excited about our solar system. I am here to explain to you that, sadly, there is no life on Mars.

As previously stated, there is no evidence of life on Mars. We took a very detailed picture of Mars' surface and saw no shred of life there. When taking this high quality of a picture, you can usually discern things 3 times bigger than the pixel size. As you can blatanly see, there are no shacks, written words, or any other signs of life there.

Having discovered life on Mars' would've helped NASA in a very big way. We would have a lot more funding if we found an alien! We have no reason to mislead you. We would gladly share the existence of alien lifeforms to the rest of humanity. Sadly, there are no alien lifeforms to reveal. Now that isn't to say there won't ever be, but as of now, NASA has not found any alien lifeforms on Mars.

What we have discovered is an excellent example of Mars' geography. This is simply a beautiful mesa on the Red Planet. Although shares a striking resemblence to a face, it is just a silly illusion! It is just shadows playing on the surface, as they usually do. This is nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, this is very similar to many mesas on our planet! Although it is beautiful, it is not an alien lifeform.

I hope that this has debunked any vicious rumors you may have heard. The simple, naked truth is this, it's just a mesa. It's just a piece of land. Again, we thank you for your concern and interest. We also hope that you continue to keep informed on NASA. It really means a lot that there are still people out there who are intersted in Mars. Sincerely, NASA.
