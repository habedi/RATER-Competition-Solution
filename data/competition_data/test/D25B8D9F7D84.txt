The first policy I believe would be the best. Allowing students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class. For example if the school's power goes out and students need to be taken home the school phones wouldn't be available. But as long as students have cell phones they can text or call their parents and tell them to come pick them up. This could apply to many other emergency's that could occur. Like an earthquake If it were to happen the power could go out. Wired phones wouldn't work but cell phones would. A cell phone could also save a students life during a fire if they were trapped in a part of the school, but no one knew where to look. They could simply just call the school to inform them that he or she were trapped and give them the location . A parent could also contact a son or daughter If something were to happen at home. If someone forgot their homework, P.E clothes or lunch they could just simply call or text their parents and have them bring it. If the students parent were to come pick up a student late they could call and tell them to go home with a friend.

There would be some negatives like a student disrupting a class with their phones, but as long as they keep them off in class their shouldn't be a problem. Anything like that could be solved with a warning and if they persist on not cooperating take away their phones and have their parents pick it up for them .
