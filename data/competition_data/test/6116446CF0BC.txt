Dear, Principal

I have noticed that we need to help our enviorment and all kids from school should participate in helping. We should all agree in participating. For some reason, after school, almost every kid goes to the basketball courts or other sport, activities. If you are below a "C" avervage you should automatically help clean up the school. Important things from school : school work, paying attention, finishing assignments, finishing home-work, and always come prepared.

The athletes in the school are needed to be focus in what they're doing. They don't stay focus, there not going to make it in the junior year or senior year in what ever sport there in. Because, school is more important than anything else right now, with out school your not going anywhere nor college or university. All athletes need to stay focus in the they want to do, whether its, pro baseball, basketball, football, or soccer, what ever sport your good at, you need to accomplish in life what you want to do. You need a 3.0 GPA if you want to play what you want.

School is place for learning for kids like you and me. In school we learn how to listen, write, and pay attention. When we get to college and have a free scholarship and education to where they you want to go. School is a great place for you and others that need it.

Sincerely,
