I think that having the use of that technology in a class room. I think it would be a good idea because then teachers would know if something was wrong with the students and they could do something about it. Or if the students were not into the lesson the teachers was teaching and the teachers could try to change the lesson up a bit. It could also be helpful because if the student was sad the teacher would know and could try to help the student out in some kind of way. Or say like if the student was mad and the teacher didnt know the student could lash out of them and that would be bad but with the 3d computer the teacher could find out and could stay out of their way or try to help. Or say there was a bully in the class and the teacher didnt know and they had just made a new seating chart and they put the bully right by one of their victims and the student was scared you could use the 3d computer and check the student and see that he or she is scared you can solve the promblem right there and wouldnt have to worry about in the future. For example say if the teacher had a special day and she wanted to bring the students a treat so she baked some cookies and she brought the cookies to the students when their eating them she could check to see if they are happy and surprise that she brought them some cookies. Or if some of the students showed no the emotion to the teacher bringing them the 3d computer could tell them that. Say for example the students in the class took a test and normally everbody is feeling mad and bored but when they take this test all of them get a B+ or higher you could check the 3d computer and see they were all comfadent and ready for this test. In conclusion the 3d computer would be a good to use in a classroom and something teachers need.
