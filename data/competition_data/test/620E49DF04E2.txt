For centuries students have been in classrooms learning math, science and how to read and write. Students would there way from class to class ready to learn something new everyday. Regular students without any disabilities or health problems should come to school for all classes, as it would not benefit them to take any of there courses from home. There experience at school will help them grow as a person which something they won't regret. Although taking classes from home can make it easier for students they should be required to take all classes at school because it wouldn't benefit them in the long term.

Today in the modern world students tend to spend there free time inside on there phones wasting there time instead of going outside, giving them online class will just keep them inside even more. Overtime students will become very comfortable being at home and become very lazy in there houses and just waste there time even more. Not only will they be lazy but it won't be good for them either because they are being less active. Learning at home can make students less social overtime as they are not coming to school, therefore they don't see there peers. Social interactions and exercise is a must for a student to develop and grow as a person.

Coming to school gives students a chance to get some exercise walking to there class. They will also get to see there peers and interact with them. School provides experiences for students that will help them grow in the long run. It will be easier to get help from teachers as students will see them in person instead of seeing them through a screen where they can't have the same experience. Since being at school would make them healthier it would help there mental welling being too as they will feel less tired and more positive when they arrive to school. That will make them want to learn more too so they will pay attention in class more.

Taking courses at home can be beneficial for disabled or handicap students because they may not be able to move to around much. It can also be less stressful for students with busy schedules who don't sleep much and wake up in the mornings in a rush all tired and messy looking. But students can also practice better sleeping habits so they wake up refreshed and ready for school. Regardless of these small benefits students that are healthy and have no physical problems should attend there courses at school to keep there mind and body right. A happy student is a good student who will try more in school and learn better.

In conclusion, although taking classes from home can make it easier for students they should be required to take all classes at school because it wouldn't benefit them in the long term. Students make memories and have experiences in high school that will always live in there hearts as 'the good old days' when they are a lot older. Thats something that won't happen at home for them. Students shouldn't miss out on these things in life because one day they may regret it. At the end of the day students attending there classes at school will benefit them alot more then taking online classes at home.
