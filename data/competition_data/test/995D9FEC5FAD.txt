Dear Principal,

I think community service should be required to all students. Students can learn a lot from helping others. In high school community service is required, so you might as well fit it into your schedule somehow before you get into high school. Students may say they have better things to do, but half those students probably really don't have anything to do. They can spend hours playing video games and being on Facebook every week, but can't devote to doing volunteer work. Volunteering isn't a priority to many, but its more of a priority helping your community or possibly the world, than playing video games or wasting time on the computer. Not all students play sports so its not hard to fit 1-2 hours of community service into their schedule. When we are spending time on the computer or on our phone, that's time being wasted that can be used doing volunteer work. That's why volunteer work should be required.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
