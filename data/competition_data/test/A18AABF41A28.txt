Why Should students participate in extracurricular activities? This is a question a lot of students ask and today I'm going to help you learn why extracurricular activities are important. Extracurricular activities are really important and they will help you a lot. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because of Students get to exercise, learn new things, and also meet new people.

Students get to exercise. Play a sports makes you exercise. when someone plays sports they have to exercise a lot and eat better so they can have a better performance. They can get stronger. When you play for a sport they will make you lift heavy things so you can get stronger. have a better life. You will feel way more relax and healty after you start to play a sport. Because of this things I thing students should participate in extracurricular activities.

You get to learn new things. you could do an activity that you don't know. You can participate in a new activity to know if you are going to like it. Find an activity that you will like to do. If you do something you like to do you are going to be way better at it. Your knowledge can get bigger. If you learn new things you are going to have more knowledge. Because of all this things I think students should do extracurricular activities so they can get to learn new things.

I know that sometimes students don't like to participate in extracurricular activities. I know sometimes It's hard. However, try someting you think you are going to like. you can meet new people. you are going to be making new friends that are going to do the same activity that you are doing. This is why I think students have to participate in extracurricuar activities.

It is good for students to participate in a extracurricular activity it helps them learn new things. Students should do an extracurricular activity because of They could get fit, practice new things and make new friends. Becase of all this things I agree the students have to participate in extracurricular activities.
