Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Do you agree or disagree with this decision?

"Well to be honest i think that there should be extracurricular activities". The main reason why i think their should be extracurricular activities is because it is very good for you. Students can participate in sports. Sports is a good activity examples like soccer, basketball, football, and etc. those are sports you can tryout for and play. If you are a very talented or skilled at any sport it can lead you to scholarships. scholarships can be very important and amazing for you, sports can even get you to college and you can start playing your main sport there.

Another extracurricular activity is staying after school. Staying after school is pretty good you can stay and finished some unfinished work. Staying after and doing your work is good so you can get credit for it and have good grades. Having good grades can lead you to your next grade and have better advanced classes. So staying after school is a very good extracurricular activity and better for your future.

So far i still agree on having extracurricular activities you can even do the schools news paper '' thats if your school has one''. The school news paper can tell you upcoming day like early dismissals, two hour delays, and upcoming tests. Thats one activity you can do on the other hand you can start thinking about thinking about what clubs you would like to be in. Clubs are fun like are so many options theirs reading club, running, music, yoga, filming, etc. it can be good being in a club because you can learn more and do more.

another extracurricular activity can be picking up trash around the school and in the school. You can either recycle it or throw it away in the garbage. Its good keeping the school clean and good cleaning after yourself. and it would help the environment less garbage in the world more fresh air ''if that made sense''. If the principal decided to have extracurricular activities i would definitely agree with it. sports to scholarships, school news paper to new upcoming things, clubs, finishing your work after school are good reasons why i agree that their should be extracurricular activities. So do you agree or disagree with this decision?
