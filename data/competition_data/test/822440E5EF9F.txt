I mean i think its a bad idea and a good idea. Well my opion on it being a good idea is because some students like trying out for new stuff and some dont. For me I would like to stay home and eat food and be on my phone. But other kids like doing stuff like that and enerfearing into some stuff. but the bad point of veiw is some students dont like to do stuff like that and make them have to participate into stuff like that. And spending a lot of time and always working. But no I really dont like it because I have a lot going on with school so I really dont want that and I dont like sports and really dont like too run. So its a no for me because im not into doing something if I havent cheaked it out yet. But I mean I could try it it depeneds on what it is. Like soccer I aint doint that because try outs are over and im really bad at soccer so yea depends on what it is.
