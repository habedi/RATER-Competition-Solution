I think they should join the club. They are the best you can go to many different places. Luke got to go sight seeing. He got his wish. So come on and join. You will have so much fun and you will be so happy. I hope you do come. It Wilber fun. To see you here and having fun. This is only for people out of high school

Luke didn't have to pay so it is free. People that are like over 20 want to join a program for the summer go for it it's free. No cost at all hope I see any time you are free. For as long as you want that you have here. See the world for as long as you want. If you have to leave early at least we know you were happy.

So if you like boats then they would like a trip come on and join.

Luke was so happy when he joined.

You can join and be happy to so if you join you can be happy to. Hope we see you next time you want to see the world. We can meet and talk. We will actually

Be taking many trips so don't forget to check and call for your parents.
