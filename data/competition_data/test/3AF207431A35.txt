Dear Principal,

I have noticed that you are deciding to change the schools sport policy. I think that you shouldn't do that. Consider the fact that some people do better in school by participating in sports. It helps the students work as a team.

Some people to sports because their parents make them. Others do it for the love of the sport. How would you feel if some one took away something that you loved just cause your not getting a B average? I'm thinking not very happy. Also, many parents might get mad at you for doing that. It's the parents job to decide if the student should stop doing sports or not, if it's affecting their grades.

Doing sports also helps students with teamwork. In school teachers are always looking for new ways to help students work as a team. If you are doing sports or other activities you need to work as a team to win or to finish the job. So students use their skills that they learn by doing sports to how they work with others in school.

Also, if students want to get into sports but they have a C average they might be disappointed. Because they can't
