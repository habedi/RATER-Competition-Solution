Hello, Principal my name is STUDENT_NAME and i recommend that students should take position in which being required to perform community service.

I think students should perform Community Service why because it will help not only us the kids of the future but others as well and if they see us helping out the community then they would try to do the same as well. Community Service is very important to our environment if we don't keep it clean then who will, that's why we need to take a step ahead and put what people say about us helping out the community in the trash , they will try to join us one day . The specific matter is to teach our environment that we can stay clean such as not littering , recycling, and Community Services for a good purpose.

Sometimes i see people my age doing Community Services and mainly because the stole something from a warehouse or store or fail to go to court . Us as young people need to teach each other not to fall because if we do were going to fall in a hole that we cant get out of , when we could dig that hole for a community pool or basketball court or something to keep us in a educated service.

Community Service will change the way other people look at us , if someone came down here from Boston they would wont to turn back around because of how we treat our community but if we had a clean and neat environment they would enjoy staying down here for a couple of weeks or even longer.

This is what i recommend to students being positioned and taken part of Community Services.
