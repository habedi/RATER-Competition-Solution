Dear Principal,

I really think that u should let the students bring their cell phones to school and be able to use them at lunch and other free class time because someone's mom might need to talk to them.

Example one: The reason why the students should be able to bring phones to school is because it shows them that you can trust them not to use their cell phones during class time.

Meaning that if the students use their cell phones during class time the teachers would give them three chances then after those three chances are up the teacher gets to take the students cell phone until the end of the school day.

Example two: Is that if the students can use their cell phones during free time classes the can do whatever they want in their free time they could talk on the phone, text people, play games, and etc.

Meaning that the students can use their phones during anytime of the free time classes and at there lunch time and the teacher's or any staff members can not take their phone away from them.

That's the reason why i think that the principal should let us bring cell phones.
