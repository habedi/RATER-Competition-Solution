This article is mainly shown to inform readers just how useful exploring Venus can be. The author is quite enthusiastic about this topic and is eager to offer his/her insight on the subject. The author believes that getting a chance to explore Venus is a great benefit, because previous studies have led to scientists speculating that Venus was probably at one point in time just like Earth. Meaning that it probably was suitable for life or once had life, however it is unlike;y that it has any forms of life now.

Venus has too harsh of conditions to be able to support anything. High atmoshperic pressure, High concentration of sulfuric acid in the air, Intense heat all of these factors go into reasoning as to why it is not a good idea to go there unprepared especially when NASA is still working on ways to do so, or maybe they have ( I don't know i haven,t been updated on a topic) anyway even though it is proven to be dangerous it is not impossible. Landing on Venus and gathering data would be an outstanding accomplishment.

The author clearly wants this to happen and is very interested to see what else the world can achieve. Showing great interest on the topic and overall writing this article in general.
