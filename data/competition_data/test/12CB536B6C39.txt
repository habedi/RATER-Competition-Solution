After school activitys, should they be requried to keep all kids active? No I do not think they should be because some kids just dont want to do other extracurricular activitys.

I do understand the concept of this however because the principal wants all the kids to be socialy active, however some kids need their alone time or they just do not like talking to other people, and making them do after school activitys can be great for some kids and bad for others.

I belive the after school activitys should stay the way they are, If you want to then you can, if not oh well because while some kids love sports clubs and other extracurricuar activitys like myself, others do not, some kids even dislike going to after school activitys,

Also some kids are not able to do these things so it may make those kids feel left out if it is "required" and they can not do it, or even if the after school activity is something the kid can do at home, lots of kids just dont have the time to do things like that, like me for example I play football (not for my school) and my dad is parylyzed and I have to help him with a lot of things every day and its very time consuming and I barely have time to go to football because of this and I know there a lot of other kids out there who are in a life similar to mine, and just do not have the time to do anything extra that they dont usaly do.

Another thing is some kids parents have to be at work when after school activitys are going on so if a kid lives far away fom the school how would they get there if it was required? Then if they where not there their grade or credit or however the school rates/grades the after school activitys attendence numbers would suffer, and that could hurt the kid in the future if they are trying to go to college. I hope this writting has helped you see that required after school activitys should stay optional and that if it was required some kids can be effected in a lot of bad ways, so please keep extracurricular activitys optional.
