The author supports his idea in many ways. He says there are many dangers in the exploration of Venus. He also says that the exploration of Venus is worth it despite the dangers.

In paragraph 4 the author says astronomers are fascinated by Venus. Venus may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Venus can sometiomes be our nearest option for planetary visit. In paragraph 5 the author states that NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. The tempature would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of the sea level on Earth. The radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Those are not easy conditions but they are still survivable for humans.

There is more evidence of supporting his ideas in the exploration of Venus but those are some that i included in the essay. The author did a good job supporting his idea. In my opinion I think we should at least try to figure out a way to observe the planet Venus.
