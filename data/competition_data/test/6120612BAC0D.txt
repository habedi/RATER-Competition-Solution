I think that you can work on or do anything that you want to do. I agree that you can do any one of the activities that you want to do, because you get time indoors or outdoors. So i agree.

1. So if you wanted to play a sport you can just do that thing first before you do the other activities.

Do you favorite activity first and then do the other.

Do the one that is easier.

Do the one that makes more since to you.

2. If you wanted to work on doing a yearbook.

Have help on doing it.

Work at your own paste.

Set everything up right.

3. If you get called on a student council you probably have to do it.

Do you best on trying it.

Pay attention and dont mess around.

Dont laugh or make much noise.

I agree that you should have activities for school because you are getting exercise from walking and running around inside and outside. Then if you stay inside and outside everyday then you could have a better chase of make the team for whatever sport you are trying out for.

If you want to just do one activity or sport then choose your own one to do. Like I would pick sports because I really like baseball and I also play baseball. Play at the position that you would usually play at. Also try to go in the order you think is the easiest. do the one that makes more since to you so if you play shortstop and you also play pitcher then take turns at both of the positions. Do which one is the best for you to do or play.

If you wanted to work on a yearbook. Ask for help on it raise your hand so that someone can help you do it or understand it. Work at your own paste do what the teacher asked you to do and if someone else tried to mess you up just say no that is no going to go very well for you. Set all of the paper for it up right so that it would go well for you and it would also be easy for you. Also try your very best to do good on it and try to get a good grade on it.

If you get called up for doing the students council you will probably have to do it. You would have to do your best and try to get a good grade on it. Pay attention in class and dont mess around. You might get in trouble or get a lunch detention. Dont laugh or make noise while the students council is going on because you might get in trouble you might have to sit out and not be able to do it and you could get a phone call home which would no be to good.

So if anyone would choose between sports,yearbooks, or student counseling what would you do! I know that I would pick sports because I play a sport and the sport I play is baseball. I am always at my practices, I am always there on time. And since i am always there I am getting better each and everyday I go to my practices. So if I were to pick an activity to do it would be sports because i play baseball.
