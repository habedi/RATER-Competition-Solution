Google has always been there for us when we need a fantastic search engine or when we need to figure out what special holiday it is, but little did we know about there lastest invention! Google has been seeking for a better technological future since 2009 with there latest peice; the smart vehicle. Although, this great thought has come to life for the world to visualize, I don't really believe that this invention is as great as the world may see it to be.

For a place which is already called "Lazy America", why would this nation want to progress the other lands thoughts on that belief? The fact that there are cars being made for the laziest of people who don't have the moments of time or ability to sit and drive to go from one place to another is upsetting. These cars are being made for the people who rather text, eat, (etc.) and drive than pay attention to the road. Google had mentioned that their cars must have "the human driver..remain alert and be ready to take over..", but Google is trying to get around that problem so the car is totally self-operated. Not only Google, but many other vehicle companies. For example, in paragraph ten, it states that the "Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drives themselves by 2020." What does this prove? Does this show that America's self worth is our inventions? No, I believe that this shows how unbelievably lazy this world has become.

Secondly, Although this autopilot car may caught the heart and the eyes of everyone who has heard about this invention, I'm positive that these cars could not be afforable to the people who want them most. Because of the amount of time and money that it took to research how to make these cars, it would cost lots of money to replenish those funds and there is only one way of doing that for those vehicle companies and for Google; selling their cars for higher prices. For this reasoning, many of the lower classes and comfortably living middle classes would not be able to pay for the cars. In paragraph one, it talks about how "the car he{Sergey Brin} foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis.." and cars, which is good for our planet and good for the ozone, but if the only people who have these cars are the rich, which is low in numbers of people as a whole, what difference would it make if the many people who cannot afford these smart cars are still giving off these gas fumes and pollution into the air? Many people think about how this will affect the human race and how great of an invention this is. Yes, this invention may have its perks, but it wouldn't make a difference for those who cannot afford the first downpayment of these cars.

Lastly, the amount of regulations and laws that have to be overturn would take many, many years for these cars to even be legal to drive in many parts of the world! "Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times." I firmly believe in this. They say this because when a human driver is always operating the vehicle, they are forced to pay attention for the sake of their lives or others.

The narrator of this article that "..special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel" at all times, but even if the human driver is holding on and behind the wheel that does not mean that they are paying attention 100% percent to the road ahead of them, which happens to be a scary thought. Many people fall asleep behind the wheel when the car is fully operated by them alone, so this would not stop many people from falling asleep.. Especially if they don't have to do anything to drive! If those many alert sensors do not alert the sleeping person, that may be trouble. Getting that passed through traffic laws would be difficult; Even for Google!

Although Google has been there for us for about a good decade and a half, helping us with our internet needs, that doesn't mean that they need to continue to move forward with something like this. The smart car, may be a pretty new thing to gaze and gauke at, but is it safe for our everyday use? Would it be safe for our newly founded driving teenagers, who already text and drive? Teaching people that it's okay to be lazy and not pay attention to the road is not something I would want to support and I believe that many people should stand behind this thought. I say "No" to this contraption.
