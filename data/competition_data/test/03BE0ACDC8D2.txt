Title: Phones & Driving (should not)

Phones and Driving don't mix. Driving with a phone causes more wrecks every year. Law enforcement have noticed the unsafety of having a phone while driving and made it where it is illegal.

Phone is a safety issue not just to the people in the car but to the one driving as well. Phones make it where the drive get sidetrack and can cause a wreck, and affect everyone life in the vehicle not just yourself. One thing that is big while driving that is a safety issues, is texting while driving. Texting on the phone is the number one reason people use their phone while driving on the road.

Driving while on the phone can be the number one thing that causes death in a car by accident. When you're driving remember you got life of other people in your hand.

They trust you not to go off the road or into another car just because you looked down at your phone.

The number one reason why I think you should not because I know family member who died and was in a wreck because of them looking at their phone.

A phone is just a distraction. When driving just put the phone away till you're not driving anymore. Just like the tv commercial always says, "A text can wait", but your like can't if you die by texting while driving. Driving is a serious manner and it takes all you focus not to mess up. Put it away it as easy as 3 seconds.

They have law for a reason. If they have a law for you not to text and drive, the made that law for a reason. Why go against it know that you're doing the wrong thing.
