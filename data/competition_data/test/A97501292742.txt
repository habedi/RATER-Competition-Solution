Venus is a planet in our solar system and is one of the closest to Earth. The harsh conditions on Venus's surface make it dificult to explore though. But scientist are eager to do this because Venus might have had life a while back. It might have had oceans too to support life.

Venus's conditions are so harsh that no space craft sent to the planet survived the landing for a few hours Venus has a thick atmosphere that is almost 97% carbon dioxide and is one of the hottest planets in our solar system. Its average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That's not all though, Venus also has acid rain and errupting volcanoes. It is truely a harsh planet.

However, NASA had an idea for sending humans to study Venus. This may sound like a crazy idea, but NASA will make sure the conditions will be safe enouph for humans be safe and study Venus. They could make a a blimp-like vehicle hovering about 30 miles above the surface of Venus. At that height, the temperature would be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the air pressure would be simular to sea level on Earth. These conditions are a little rough, but survivable for humans.

There could be many new discoveries found on venus. It may be a hard task, but maybe one day, we could find a new discovery that could change the world. Who knows what we will discover on our next mission to Venus.
