I am for technology being able to read students emotions. It can really help in the classroom when kids are starting to feel like the lesson is getting kinda stale. In the text it states, "A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored". This can help alot of kids or teens that have a hard time staying focused i the classrooms or become bored easeily, it that is to happen the computer will modify the lesson to make it more entertaining fo the student like any good teacher would be able to do.

It also have many uses outside the classroom. In the text it states, " The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games video surgery. This technology can help animaters, surgeans , artist , and many other lines of work. We perform different facial expression every day and having a computer or maybe even a phone in the future that can ajust your device to the emotion your having at the time or throughout the day. This type of technolgy can change the world and make lifes easier in the classroom for students or regular jobs.

There are many positives about thing about this technologhy though there are a couble negatives. In the modern day home computer or phone would not be able to input the many algorithms that are needed fo this technology to work. Also If your not expressive an your emotions your combuter would not be able to detect your emotins and will not ajust.
