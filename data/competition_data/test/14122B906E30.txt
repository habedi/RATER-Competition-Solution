Have you ever been caught using your cell phone in class? Even though cell phones may be a distraction, it would be a good idea to be able to use them during free time. One reason why it would be a good idea is because if students need something or need to contact someone for some reason, they can do so without any problems. It's also a good idea because it would limit the amount of students using their phones during class time.

First, it is a good idea to allow cell phones during break times because ,if students need to contact someone, they can. If a student has a family emergency and the family for some reason cannot contact the school they can go straight to the student. Also, if a student forgot something and needs someone to take it to them than they can call the person without any problems. I used to forget things a lot so whenever i needed to contact someone it was a lot more difficult than it had to be.

Another reason why it's not a bad idea to permit cell phones a school is that, it will limit the amount of students using their phones in class. Limiting this will result in less kids getting in trouble and more kids paying attention. This will allow kids to focus on their classes instead of texting their friends. I have personally never gotten in trouble for texting, but many of my friends have just because they were trying to contact their parents or for other good reasons.

I understand that you may be concerned that kids will take still text in class. As a student myself, I can assure you that kids will still text, but the number of kids will decrease dramatically. There is no way to completely abolish this problem, but there is a way to make it a smaller problem than it is.

In conclusion, there are myriad reasons why permitting phones during free time is a good idea. It will help kids contact people if needed and also prevent them from using phones during class time. Help me help this principal to make the correct choice!
