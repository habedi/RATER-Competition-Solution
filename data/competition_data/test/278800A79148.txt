Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. These projects help to prepare students for the next year as well as help the retain the information from past years. Who is the best person to design these projects? The teacher, of course. Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers know how to prepare the students for the next year, they can adjust the difficulty level, and it's an opportunity to get the students used to the specific teaching style of the teacher they're going to have.

First, teachers know what's going to be on the curriculum, so the know how to best prepare students for the coming year. For example, if a student were to design their own project, they wouldn't know what to study, because they have yet to learn the material. Teachers, however, know exactly what to put in the project to help them prepare, and they can also incorporate material from the students' previous years so they won't forget it as easily. The teachers are also trained to teach, so they would be the best at designing these projects.

Some may say that students should design their own summer projects because they can adjust the difficulty level to suit themselves. The optimal level of difficulty varies among everyone, so they shouldn't all get the same project because it might be too easy for some, and too difficult for others. To negate the first statement, students are too likely to not do a project at all over the summer with an excuse such as, "not needing to do a project because they're sure they can remember everything from the last year," or because "they're a fast learner and can learn the new material quickly." Some may even decide that their fun summer takes priority above all learning. If the teacher designs the project, then the teacher can make sure that everyone does a project so everyone will be able to excel in the coming years. To address the varying level of optimal difficulty level issue, There are AP, honors, and regular classes for this reason, and if, for any reason, the project is too hard or too easy, the student can talk to the teacher about that issue. All in all, it is best if the teacher designs the projects.

Lastly, it's an opportunity to get the students used to the specific teaching style of the teacher they're going to have. This greatly benefits the student, because studies show that people learn more and retain information longer when they're in a comfortable environment. Summer projects are a great way to make that first step into the school year and get the students familiar with a certain teaching style.

To sum it all up, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know the curriculum and can best prepare students for the next school year, they can adjust the difficulty of the project to challenge students, and it gives their new students an opportunity to become familiar with their teaching style. Summer projects are popularly viewed in a negative fashion, but these projects serve a very important use. They help students prepare for what's to come.Â Think about how many students are struggling to keep up with their classes, because they didn't do a summer project
