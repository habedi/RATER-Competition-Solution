The Face? Created by Aliens or just a landmark?

Did you beieve that the "Unmasking the Face on Mars" was just created by aliens. NASA has given us many reasons to believe what they say, and not many reasons for us not believe them. I am a NASA researcher and I'm telling you why the "Face" is actually just a landmark.

There are many reasons why the "Unmasking the Face on Mars" is a natural land form. The first reason is that NASA took three different pictures, one picture was in 1976 in the picture you can't really see anything. Scientists just thought it was another Matian mesa. At this time the cameras weren't very 3D like. So how do we know it's an actual face?

The seacond reason it is a landform is because NASA

sent another crew to take more pictures of the "face." The crew took ten pictures that were sharper than the first one in 1976. In this picture you start to see something appear. They even say "when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. People were not very happy when they heard it wasn't a alien monument.

Another reason is that they thought alien markings were being hazed. So, when they went back it was a cloudless summer. In the text they say "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That is a huge difference from 1976. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.

If you really think about it though, how come they jumped to conclusions so fast? In the passage it says it would be a good way to engage the public to Mars. Wouldn't it just attract more people to NASA to though?

In many ways there are more reasons to why this "Face" is more of a landmark than anything. From the different years they took the years, to the landmarks being hazed. You could probably think of a lot of questions to ask NASA about the photos and what the scientists are saying, but until you go up to Mars we will only know what they are telling us. Which is that the "face" is a mesa. They clearly say many times in the passage for people to believe that they are not trying to trick you.
