Dear TEACHER_NAME ,

I believe the policy with phones not being at school should be required. Students can get mad all they want to , if you see a phone at school you should take it don't give them another chance , because the students should know that the phones shouldn't be brought to school anyways. My belief on bringing phones are no because , you come to school to learn not text or call some one everyone needs their education and if you don't want it , well it is someone out their that wants it ; so don't stop someone from getting their education because you want to be selfish. Back in the day, people had to sneak around just to get their education , today they are offering it to you, and you let it go. People don't have to take time out their day just to help you learn. A lot of people think that's cute now you will not think it's cute when it is going to be hard to get a job or to get into college. I understand people wont to talk to their friends, and gossip , but give it a brake. If you bring your cellular device to school, then you would be worried about your phone so much you wouldn't be able to focus or pay attention. Your education is extremely important so don't throw it away all because you wanted to tell your best friend something or text someone in class just to be cool.
