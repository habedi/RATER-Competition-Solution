Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Most students nowadays would love to take classes by way of online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Classes being attended at home can help students learn better because most students are more comfortable at home, some students are visual learners, and they could get the help from their parents when needed.

Everyone knows that safe space in their house where they can just relax. Imagine doing your school work there. Instead of at a desk in an uncomfortable chair for most of the day, you could be sitting in a comfortable chair, your bed, or even your couch. Students are more comfortable learning at home. Students could find something that keeps them comfortable and continue to work hard at the same time. When students are in a comfortable space they're often more determined, focused, and hardworking. Students need to be comfortable, but some students also need to be able to visualize the material in order to understand it completely.

Have you ever been sitting in your class listening to a long lecture about stuff you don't even understand? You don't understand any of it because the way you learn is different from the way other people learn. Some students are visual learners. I am a visual learner and I know that taking classes at home would be a great option for me. When taking classes from home, students could listen and also watch a video conference teaching them on a specific topic. Instead of having a teacher just talking about it in front of you, the online or video conferencing could allow you to visualize the material for you to understand it better. If you're having trouble understanding the visual material, you may also have your parent or guardian help you.

While learning online, you may have one or two questions that you have relating to the material. Having a parent or guardian with you to help you understand or learn something better, can help students a lot. When you get stuck or confused, your parent could help you. Most students' parents have been through high school and college. They know what it's like to experience problems or confusion when taking on new tasks. Even asking your parents for clarification on something can go a long way on fully understanding it. Through video conferencing you could ask your teacher on the video any questions you may have. You won't have an in person teacher at your house to answer your questions, so your parents could try and help answer any of your questions in that regard.

Some students, parents, or school officials, could bring the argument in that not everyone's parents work or stay at home during the day. If your allowing your child to stay at home and take classes, there should be some sort of parental guidance making sure your student is staying on task and not being distracted. The parents have to be there for them to make sure they're not struggling and continuing to strive if you make the distance learning decision. They may also say that not everybody is a visual learner. If you don't think your child is a visual learner and is struggling in school, you could try something new and see if your child learns better visually at home. When students are attending classes from home, they'll be in a comfortable, safe spot, understanding material much better then they ever did, achieving goals for the future.
