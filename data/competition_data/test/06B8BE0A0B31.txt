Well, being completly honest, using a ma chine to detect human behivor such as with emotions and feelings towards situations and or people is a horrible idea, is defeats the porpuse of what privacy really is and how we use it, if someone is mad and or angry they will show it on their own way whenever they feel like it, we dont need a machine to do it for us, that is just wrong in so many levels, is impressive but wrong, very wrong, why dont we use this knowledge to just best ourselfs in other important stuff like making football players equipemant stronger but lighter at the same time so they dont run with an extra 60 pounds and are less likely to get a concussion playing the sport they love, or discovering a new way of building a computer or a monitor using carbon molecules for example, since is less likely to break and more durable throughout the years.
