I am Mackenzie Dazzleberry a scientist at

NASA and we has been seeing a figure that looks like a humans head, but I don't like it's that, i think that it is a lanform. The nose could bumps from if people dumped things there or it could be bumps. The eyes could again be waste that people dumped and it formed into bumps or the nose and eyes could be hills on the face.

I also think that the face could be landforms because they are common around the American West and it looks like from the front it looks like a circle but if you look at it from the side it looks like a rectangle. The face could be a landform because we ended up revealing that it was infact a landform.

I belive that the face is a landform because of the shape on the bottom and because from all the pictures we gathered when we put them together they look like a landform, just because the things that look like eyes and a nose doen't mean that it could be an alien, the landform could have bumps or hills that formed from people dumping waste on it or from having hills on it, or it could be dents on it from things stepping, walking, or things falling on it.
