Dear, Senator

When voting for the president of the United States we need to make sure he or she will get there job done. I think electoral voting is better than popular voting. There are parites and each candidate running for president in your state had his or her own grop of electors. Thats usually based on the candidate's political party. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. In order for the president to be elected they must have a majority of 270 electoral votes. In the electoral college system, voters vote not only for the president, but for a slate of electors. The argument against the electoral college is what they call the disaster factor.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee however, it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.

There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic reasons.

The first reason is the certainty of outcome. The outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. It is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote comprared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

To add onto the five reasons we have the second reason that states Everyones President. The electoral college requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised. They would feel this way because there votes wouldnt count. Our third reason we have Swing states these ones are likely to be most thoughtful. For our forth and fith we have big states and aviod run off elections.

To wrap this up i think electoral voting is a much better way of finding out who the president should be. When you do popular voting it doesnt give you a good idea of what the people think.
