The way they used there evidence have a lot of good points and details to support what they're talking about. If we can leran how to get sanppuls from Venus and know how to get it back in it old frome maybe one day some of us could can live on it.

How the author supports there idea is base off the facts of there little articaol is that Venus used to be like a twin to are Earth. So that could mean there used to be living organisum on the used to be twin planet. But there is a way to study it. It just,chaillageing you see Venus is now an unfrogiveabul planet and gos thuoe hieh tepuchers hardly any of the technoulugy NASA sent there alot of them can't even last for atlest severl hrs. But theres still a chanes we can laran more about Venus. NASA evean sent some of us there just not too close to the planet or we will tran in to chinken nugats, and no one wasts that.

Well base of what I said here my conclusion is that it is worth larning about Venus and even other planets. We need to know are soler systum... it going to be a challen, but we can do it.
