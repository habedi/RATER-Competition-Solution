Hello readers my name is PROPER_NAME and, today I'm gonna dicuss the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman that enables computers to indentify human emotions. Also I'm gonna support this claim about the new human emotions technology,and I'm gonna use details from the story to back up this claim so you readers know "this new" technology is legit. So now let's get to it shall we you readers out there.

A Renaissance painting by artist Leonardo da Vinci called Mona Lisa was studied by a scientist named Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who innovated some new computer software that can recognize human emtions, working alongside with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr Huang and his colleague were developing a better way for humans and humans to communicate with each other.I agree with this claim, you wanna why? Because technlogy in general has come a long way, and the fact it's taken to the next step is phenomenal. Like it might be a chance that a computer software can determine how we feel and not just humans in genreal, but even old paintings so long ago isn't that incredible. But in part of the story i feel like tihs software could actually work out was that it said that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one oe more muscles is an "action unit." which means that they need to scan the face of a human like features in order to scan the face. When works on thigns like this he normally relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, he is the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Edwin has classified six emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the muscles. For instance when you raise your eyebrows you're surprised, but when you raise your eyebrows down by your mouth you're angry.

Another good reason why i think this technology is really good and it can help is.That when facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Use videp imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements- from a real face such as Mona Lisa. If u weigh the different units' the software can even identify mixed emotions. So cool that just shows you how advanced technology can be. Also each expression is cmpared against a neutral face.

My final defense to back this claim up is that computers got so advanced over the years it's kinda like it knows who to set up your mood of what you wanna see. For instance, if you smile when a Web ad appears on oyur screen, a smilar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different. Hell a classroom computer could even detect when a student is becoming confused or bored. Well in that case it could vhelp modify lesson for the student to make them become more intertested in the assignment.

Well thank you readers i feel like i backed up my case with tih claim, we know computers or even technology in general might've changed in a jurrasic way but we will wonder what the future has in stored for us. We just gotta find out what's next in technology. My name is PROPER_NAME and this is my claim for FACS.
