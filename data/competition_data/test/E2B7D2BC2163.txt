Dear Principal,

I know that you are stuck on the decision on whether to make students of our school perform community service or not. I am here to say that you should because it will be a learning experience to my peers to perform such a task. Some may already perform community service, so some are agreeing with me and others may enjoy it and will likely want to do it for the community just by doing it once. It may take some time, but it can be worth it to have a good feeling for doing the right thing. Many of my friends want to help the community, but don't know how and with this plan it is ideal for their problem.

One community service idea is helping the retirement home down the street of our school. It feels great to help the elderly for they might have done something important to us or is one of our relatives. I would treat others how I would want to be treated. Not may help them out, so why don't we lend a hand to the people working at the retirement home. My grandmother is there and I visit her everyday.

Another great idea is to help around the school by cleaning up some of the litter and helping out the janitors. Also the school will look fantastic with it being nice and clean. As well as helping our own environment to keep us focused on learning.

Making a mural at our school will make our school look even better and it can be fun too! We can make a mural of a holiday, memory, or just a picture! There are many ways and benefits of doing community service whether it is at our neighborhood, at our school, or even at another town! By doing community service we show little kids what is right and are a perfect role model for them. They might want to join along with us helping the community, so please allow them to do community service at least once!
