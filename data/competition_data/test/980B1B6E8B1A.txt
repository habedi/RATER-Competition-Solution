In today's society we struggle to put our phones away. We use it everywhere we go. Home, school, work. No matter what were on our phones, but should we be on our phones while we are driving. Most people would say no to this because it distracts you from the road and it puts everyone it the car at risk of an accident. 80 percent of people who have crashed was on their phone calling someone or just texting or watching a video. They get to distracted with YouTube, snapchat, Instagram, twitter and reedit. Maybe they were on them for a second and was looking away from the road then someone pull out in front of them and they couldn't react quick enough. They just hit him now their child in the back is now seriously hurt or the people in the other car are hurt too. People still think it's a good idea to let people drive with their phones. Imagine your child in the car first time driving and someone not paying attention because they were looking at their phone come out and hits your son. You wouldn't be happy and u would not like to lose your son/daughter with a dummy that was staring into his phone. it's not safe for people and it can cause some serious harm. I'm not saying u can't check your phone but do it at stoplight or use it when u need your GPS. Do not look at it 24/7 while u are driving it deteriorates your reaction time and make you end up in a hospital.
