This article is about a messa/butte on the planet of Mars, that looks exactly like the face of an Egyptian Pharoh. It contains positives and negatives to both sides. People who believe that there are actually people living on the planet, and those who say it is just a landform.

First, the people who say that there is really a civilization, were probably sitting in the sun to long. They also may not believe in the Bible. It says that God came once to die for all mankind. If that's not true than wouldn't he have to go to every single planet to die for those people too? It really just doesn't add up! Second, the people that say that it is really only a natural landform are probably more acurate. While the Face does on fact look like someone built it doesn't mean that there are people living there. The Bible does mention aliens, but not of that sort. It refers to them as people who have denied God and gone their own ways. Third, the article states that the Face has "become a pop icon". How can this really be true? They don't know if it is a planet that has martians living on it or not! People are saying that NASA is hiding what they know about it and that defenders of NASA's budget, wish that there was an ancient civilization living on Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that earth is the only place where life can exist. We would die if we lived on Mars! God made the universe special, but made earth the most special. As a Christian, I believe that God has created me and everyone else on earth for His glory. There are just to many questions we could ask. For example, If there is life on Mars, of any kind, why haven't they contacted us? Are there people not intelligent enough to think of a way to reach us? Wouldn't they send their ships out after ours when they saw ours? If you look at it really close you can see that it doesn't add up at all.
