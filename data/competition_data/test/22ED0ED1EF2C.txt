Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that its a good idea to make sure students are passing all their classes with good grades in order for them to join any sports, but I also think that it would be better if you only did that with the kids that get in trouble constantly because I think that would keep the students from getting in trouble, and then when they stop getting in trouble then you could tell them that in order for them to join any sports they would have to be passing all their classes with a B or higher. After you have talked to those students and they still miss behave then you would have to take them out of the sport they wanted to be in. Once you take them out and they know your being serious about it then they will get good grades and behave so they can continue playing the sport they wanted to join.

You should also talk to the students that don't get in trouble because some are really good students and they still don't have good grades, but they really want to join a sport so maybe you can convince them to come to tutoring or to come get help after school, so that way they can have good grades and join the sport that they want to join. Well those are my opinions but its ok if you don't like them, i think those would be the most reasonable answerer to your suggestions.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
