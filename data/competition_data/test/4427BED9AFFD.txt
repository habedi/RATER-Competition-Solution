Dear principal,

I am writing u this letter because in order for us to play sports or other activities we have to get a grade B average. If not then we cant play well i agree with u because students are very smart and they are capable of having good grades. But at the same time i disagree. One reason why i disagree is because not that much student get that much of good grades and some of the students that get the bad grades are the one who play good and sports. But at the same time i understand were your coming from. But can u atlases make a deal with them that if they do good in school and have there grades up then they can play because this year we wont to win the championship for baseball. Last year we almost won but we lost because we lost one of our best player named victor dude to his grades hope u read and think about it.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
