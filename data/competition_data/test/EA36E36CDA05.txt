In the article ''Driverless Cars Are Coming" I thinks this is a very crazy idea, because it is very dangerous! Anyone to even consdier we should have driveless cars is out of their minds. According to the paasge it says "That the only safe cas has a human driver in control at all times." I feel like no one should ever put themselves in danger because of this stupid invention.

"If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer.?" This is another reason why this is a crazy idea, what if something goes wrong? What if someone were to have an accident, it would more than likely put the driver at fault . Although some people find driving boring and might just someone drving them around instead, this would be a big pro to them.

Everyone should consider the possible outcomes of these driverless cars and how much damage they will cause. Also what about the cost for this "Fancy Driverless Car" who is willing to pay thousands or maybe even millions of dollars for these vehicles. Why even think about spending this much money on something that might not even work or be dangerous.

My thoughts on the " Driverless Cars" may be different from anyone else but just think about the outcomes of this stupid car. People get into plenty of accidents with still controlling the car. These driverless car are nothing but trouble.
