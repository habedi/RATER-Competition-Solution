Limiting car usage is a great idea. If this ever does happen it will be a new Revolution for us all. Some might say that its outragious and unthinkable but it will benefit us in many ways. If we limit car usage there will be less polution, less stress, less traffic, more outside activities which means being healthier and last but not least it will be safer.

To begin with, with limited car usage there will be less polution and less stress. Most of our polution comes from cars, the smoke that the engine of the car lets out causes it. For example, Paris suffered a "near-record pollution" (source 2) due to the diesel. But after they enforced a fine of 22- euro "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"(source 2). Don't you think that this is a positive outcome and this is benefiting us? Polution is a very important issue in the United States and we need to fix it or at least try. Now lets talk about stress, everybody has stress even if its from school, work, family ect. And everybody wants to have the least amount of stress as possible or no stress at all. If we limit the car use that will be taking a stress away from oneself, "when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"(source 1). Because that way parents dont have to worry whether their kids will get home safely. They wont have to worry about if they got into an accident, if after the pary they drived home intoxicated. Car accidents are very common in the United States and has caused many deaths so why not reduce that number,of deaths, and reduce car usage in the process? And not only for parents ,but elderly's as well  because some senior citizens still drive with or without license and that could cause a mayor incident.

Furthermore, by redusing car usage there will be more outdoor activities which means that it will be a lot more healthier. Think about it, by driving a car you dont exercise but if a person walks to a place, they are exersicing. For example, in German Suburb people have a limited car usage and you can hear the "swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant motor"(source 1). The person could hear the outside activity and not the sound of cars passing by which means there was interaction between folks. Also, "parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city..."(source 3) and isnt the government,especially Michelle Obama, trying to always give out messages of not only eating helathy but playing outside and interact with the community? well this is one way we can support that. Plus in this 21st century kids are always on their phones, tablets, computer and when they go out its to hang out with friends at the movies a party but they use cars. If the car usage is limited they wont have that many options and they could interact outside of their little "bubble". What ever way you look at this its gonna be a positive outcome even if its small.

Moreover, by reducing car usage there will be definetely less traffic and it will be a new beginning. To prove this points, in Bogota, Colombia "million of Colombians hiked, biked, skated ot took buses to work during a car- free day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams" (source 3). People hate traffic, it has not been known a person that doesnt. So, reducing car usage is equal to reducing traffic jams, why not do it then? Now it was never said  that there will be absolutely no cars just the decrease with it. There will be public transportations like taxis and buses but even if those where still be able to be used there wont be as much traffic. It is understandable that people sometimes need to get to places where you cant really walk to get there so the public transportation will be permitted. Also this will mean a "new beginning", Enrique Riera, mayor of Praguay said "These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing boreders," (source 3). This statement says it all a "revolutionary change" its what we need. People are depending in cars so much and thats not good.

To end this thoughts, it is a great idea to limit the usage of cars. People will have one less thing to worry about and who woulnt like that huh? Also it will be healthy for the environment and the citizens and lets not forget, there will be less of a traffic jam. Plus it will be a big change but at the same time it wouldnt because statistics have shown that " Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by" (source 4). So it already started little by little we just have to accelerated the process a bit more."As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly  9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995" (source 4),just think about all the positive outcomes of this change.
