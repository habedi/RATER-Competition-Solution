According to my scientific studies done at NASA, this landform is natural. It is not made by aliens. I have done much research in my day as a scientist at NASA, and I know that plates on a surface can shift land due to forces, and that is why I do not believe this "face" was made by aliens.

I believe this face on Mars is natural because aliens are not real. This face on Mars just happens to look like a face. In my experienced years of being a sceintist, I know people get fired up about things that are not supposed to look like something else but they do. This is a perfect examle of just that! This face is naturally made, but because it looks like the face of an Egyptian Pharaoh, it is different. Just because it looks like something does not mean that aliens or something else that is creapy made it. This landform just happened to look like a face. That is that. There is not enough evidence to support that aliens made the Pharaoh-face landform, so for now, let us consider the face naturally made.

Overall, I believe this face is naturally made. There is no evidence that supports the fact that aliens went to Mars and made a face on the surface so the entire planet Earth could see it and become curious. On the other hand, there is more evidence to support the scientific theory; The landform is naturally made. Aliens are not real, and there is litle to no evidence to support the alien theory. Until someone comes to me and finds supporting details about aliens creating this landform, I will not change my thoughts and views on the whole situation.
