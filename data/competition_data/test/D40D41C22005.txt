Through out this whole article it seems like the author wants someone to go to Venus. He is giving reasons and facts throught the passege. I believe the author wants it explored.

Pretty much all of paragraph 8 explains it. "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead is into many equally intimidating endeavors." That whole sentece showed that the author was voting to go to Venus not against it. He supported his claims pretty well, after reading this I feel like it could become possible in the near future.

All of this article is scatter with facts and evidence on why humans could survive on Venus. I beleave the other is very set on the idea of humans on Venus. After reading this I feel like it could become possible in the near future.
