Should drivers be allowed to use cellphones while driving?

Drivers should not be allowed to text while drive is what I believe statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teens. 12 million car crashes in 2013 involved crashes in text messages. Texting while driving show that this multitasking at least 341,000 behind the wheel is becoming more dangerous and life threatening now. Because technology will change and new distractions will be involved. According to research conducted at children's hospital teens who don't frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away there the phones while driving outweigh any drawbacks such as being able to pay attention better on the road, and being less likely to have crash and also following the law. Parents should also avoid talking to students as that can also be a big distraction for them. Cellphones aren't just about texting but multi behaviors it's about anything that can cause a distraction from the road such as social media apps , and music have the potential to draw away from the road. Cellphone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. Texting is undeniably the most dangerous thing a person can do while on the road and its becoming more and more common as the leading causes of death from car crashes are just that and intoxication. Today the majority of humans own and operate cellphones on a daily basis and that's a distraction from what they're doing and can be very dangerous when your driving because you aren't paying any attention to the road and can kill someone.

Something as simple as calling someone can also be dangerous but it's not the leading cause of death. from driver's messages and keeping your eyes on the road is and that's really a major dilemma for someone else who's unaware of that. so I believe that in the future people should always make to keep an open eye for this because it can be very life threatening.

I would consider this age the phone boom since widely now everyone has or owns a communication device and this allows for simple talking and texting time now moves a lot faster than before so people are now trying to catch up with it and that can really become distraction for a lot of people. And those really aren't safe anymore because that can cause car crashes and even death that put you and someone else at a high risk paying attention and being aware is very important you don't want be the cause of someone's death or maybe even a child's death because you were to ignorant to follow the basic law so my plan would be to limit the use of phones on the road while driving and allowing only when you are parked.

The general driving statistics on the national safety reports that that texting while driving made a dramatic increase of 1.6 million crashes an estimated year high. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

The statistics?

While driving and texting may seem not that much to worry about the death toll seems to speak much for itself. 1 out of 4 accidents and car crashes happen because texting and phone use during driving this seems to be all too common for teens in some areas because according to the AA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting which also means there aware of the safety concerns these situations tend to have people nationwide. Teens are more susceptible to car crashes the likely hood of adults they are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near crashes than adults are prone too. A teen driver who has a passenger in the car doubles the risk more than 5x likely. A cellphone use becomes a national problem there never a reason to risk your life and someone else's to get a simple text in the chances of getting into a car crash with a passenger increase don't be careless is the importance of this drive safe.
