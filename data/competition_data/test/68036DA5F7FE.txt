Using computers to detect emotons in a picture is outrageous. Technology has become too much apart of our everyday lives and its stepping over the line. From smart phones to this new FACS machine, technology has advanced too much.

I honestly have no words for how insane this is. Scientists these days would do anything to create a machine more like a human. Now theyre asking machines to detect emotions, whats next. I for one do not think that they need to start making robots that will eventually take over the human race. this is ubsurd. Why would anyone trust machinery to detect emotions, why couldnt they have left Mona Lisa alone and just said that she looked happy and content? We do not need technology for anything! Especially not this.

Humans and machines do not need to communicate at all let alone "emotionally communicate". thats just wrong. Humans are humans and technology is technology. Advancements in technology shouldve stopped at smart phones. People wonder why half the stuff that goes on these days is so bad, its because we have allowed technology to come into our world and give people resources they never wouldve needed.

Computers and humans do not need to be related, they should stay seperate. no one in their right mind should want an emotional connection with a robot, thats wrong. Robots should not be a thing and technology needs to stop before it gets out of control and its no longer in the humans hands its in the machines.

Dont let technology take over the world.
