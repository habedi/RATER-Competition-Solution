Dear Principle,

I believe that you should allow students to use cell phones during free time at school, only during time that they ( students) have when they aren't in class learning.

The student will still be getting his/her academic needs.

Cell phones will not change that if you follow through with your policy one, which tells the student to turn off all devices before instructional time.

with this policy students will not sneak and use cell phones.

Most of the time they get caught and you have to go through with the child complaining about why they where using the phone and so forth.

Well, if the policy is enforced students would not have a reason to use to cell phone if they have just used it during free time.

why not allow this reasonable policy?

Its perfect and you can modify the problems as you go on and enforce this policy.

Therefore, nothing will be changed only the teachers, knowing there is a turned off cell phone in a students pocket, but if the students cant follow the rules band cell phone from whom ever disobeys the policy.
