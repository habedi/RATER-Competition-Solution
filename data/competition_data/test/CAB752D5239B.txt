This use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

As stated on paragraph number six towards the end, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored". We can always detect on the way a perdon is feeling just by looking at their facil expression that they are giving .This new computer technology thing would turn out to be somehting very succesful to a way that the teachers would now be concerned to where exactly it is that the students might just need help. This proves that we can not always prove how a person is feeling to help them out because they don't speak up even though it just might be because them may be feeling scared to ask a simple question.

Teachers would feel a relief on even aswering a simple question that would turn out to help out and improve on something for as simple as it may be.
