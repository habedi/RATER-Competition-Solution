Teacher assigned projects will keep everyone happy,Even though student designed projects are more creative and are the students choice they don't always know or understand what the teacher wants from their project,but when its a teacher designed project the students will have a better idea of what the teacher is looking for and can try to meet all those goals. It also makes the project more structured when the teacher makes it and everyone is expected to have the same type of project. It also makes grading easier for teachers cause they know what to expect.

When a teacher assigns a project they usually list certain requirements that they want in a project. Another project a teacher may assign is a packet with questions they ask the students to complete for the first day of school. With these types of assignments it is easy to know what the teacher is asking you to present for them. in a student designed project they cannot make the requirements very specific cause students may be doing completely opposite topics which make the teachers requirements very vague.

Teacher designed projects are easier on teachers. Grading is easier for teachers when they create it,because they know what they want and in their projects they design they can just look through the students work and check to see if they mention what was wanted in the rubric. Also if its teacher designed then they will most likely be old projects they have done in the past which they would know how to answer any problems that my arise for students while trying to create their work.

Yes even though teacher designed projects are not as creativity promoting as a student project it still does allow students to be creative in how they answer or present cause not every project will be the same while also having key details. Another point student designed project people may choose is that it makes it so that it is easier since its new and the student chose to do this topic the problem with that is the student may have been able to chose the topic but it may not have been a good topic that would've been presented well also if its new every year then the teachers may encounter problems that were not resolved due to the projects being different every year.

So teacher designed projects have more benefits too them then just student designed project. By helping both teachers and students making it easier and more defined for grading. They also ensure that the project has answers to any problems students have while making their projects
