Dear Principal,

I don't think that making students that are having C averages not compete in sports is not very fair. You might say "why"?

Well in my opinion i think they should still be aloud to.

Because i have suffered with C s and have been is basketball and track.

I mean we try hard enough just to make a C s! if you did do that i don't think you would have many kids in athletes. Why? Because its hard to just pass with a B or a A.

So we try to make a C that way we still pass.

Okay so what if the best player got a 76 on a test well its still passing, but no he cant play. i think he would be very disappointed. he studded the test very hard and he still douse not get to play.

So lets take another person in to considerations. There is this young boy his name is RELATIVE_NAME and he loves football! He is quterback and the team needs him to win

Friday Nights Game. its Tuesday and he has been studding for this big math quiz on Thursday.

finely the Thursdays comes around he take the test and he passes with a 74. But man he cant play because you made the rule were you have to make a 80 or above.

Well you just made that team lose there game but if you had not made that rule he could have played and won the game.

In conclusions think you should keep the passing grades for sports the same way it has all way been. Please Just take my paper in to consideration.

Thanks.
