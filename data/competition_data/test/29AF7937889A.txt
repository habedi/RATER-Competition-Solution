This technology could be valuable in many areas of the world. This technology shows emotions and feelings that humans can't tell about other people. It could be used as if someone got in trouble and they needed to know their emotions to understand how the person is feeling.

This new technology could be useful in many places, one of them being police work. They could use that to find out how some suspects or victims feel. They could use it to see if the suspect is lying by if his face shows worry, fear, surprise, anger or discust. All of those feelings and emothions could be helpful and valuable to figure out a case.

In a classroom, it would be a lot less useful. It would be cool tool to show students and things like that. They could learn how to use it and understnad how it was put together in science class. It would be good for them to try new technologies so they can learn what scientists are doing in the world. They can enjoy learning and trying about something cool and interesting. Although it wouldnt be that valuable in a classroom. It would be somewhat valuable so the students can learn how it works and try it out, but it also wouldnt be valuable because it would be used for learning, which is good, but it is meant for showing emotion and feelings and the students would only be playing with it. It would be good for everyone to get a chance to use it and learn about it for like a week, but it wouldnt be valuable to have it there yearly round.
