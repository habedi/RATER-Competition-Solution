Paris bans driving due to smog , Robert Duffer explains a recent expirement conducted by Paris to reduce smog. "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city," states Duffer. In this expirement Paris ordered motorists with even numbered license plates to leave their cars at home or have to pay a 22-euro fine. The next day motorists with odd-numbered license plates were odered to do the same. There was an exeption of this order for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers and public transpotation was free. As a result of this Paris had reduced the number of micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter to 147.

Another reason that limiting car usage benefits us is that it helps community. In the article,

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Rosenthal describes a cummunity in Vauban, Germany that has given up cars.

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota , Andrew Selsky introduces the tradition in Bogota, Columbia of Car-Free Day. In Car-Free Day only buses and taxis are permitted in the capitla city of 7 million. One result of this according to Selsky is, "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; eneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up". These additions to the city will improve the activity of people's fitness and improve the well being of the capital of Columbia.

There has been large amounts of information drawn from certain "Car-Free" expirements around the world. It has shown that the limited usage of cars has improved the environment by reducing smog in Paris and has also helped communities like Vaubaun increase the happiness of its citizens, and Bogota by improving the city to fit a "Car-Free" environment. With the introduction of the improvements to public transpotation and accessibality of cities, exessive car usage may be a thing of the past.
