Many schools require summer projects to make sure the student is still learning during break, some school's have teacher-designed projects while others have student-designed projects. Although, some individuals believe they should have student-designed projects so that the students are not feeling controlled it is important for them to realize that students tend to take the easy route out. The best way to make sure a student is really getting educated is with teacher-designed projects because the educator knows when the student is being challenged or not, it helps save time, Lastly because the students are still learning.

The first reason teacher-designed projects are more beneficial is because the educator knows when a student is being pushed or not. Some students choose projects that are way to hard for them others pick projects that even there little siblings can do, But when you have a teacher-designed project they know exactly what your capable of doing. For example in English when Generic_Name picked out a book that was way to hard for him, and Ms Generic_NameÂ helped him pick out a different book that was more on his level. That showed me that educators know what each student is capable of doing.

Another reason we should have teacher-designed projects is because it saves so much time. Most students spend days thinking about project ideas that best suit them and that are not difficult to do. Teacher-designed projects help with that because they choose the topic for you and you dont have to worry about not having a good project idea, Like when we had to do research about a person who changed the way we live today in social studies, I thought for hours, but couldnt decide on who to do it on so i asked Mr Generic_Name and he gave me the perfect person in just 2 minutes. That shows how teacher-designed projects are more time saving.

The last reason we should have teacher-designed projects is because the students are still learning. Most students struggle doing the project it self, So coming up with a project and then doing it can be confusing. Like when Generic_Name was having trouble coming up with the project topic and when he finally found a topic he wanted to do he didnt have enough time to do the actual project so he failed. That show us coming up with a topic can be hard but its okay because your still learning and your brain is still growing.

In conclusion the best way to make sure if a student is really getting educated during break is by having teacher-designed projects. Because the educator knows when a student is being challenged or not,it helps save lots of time,and lastly because the student is still learning. Even though some might disagree, teacher-designed projects are more beneficial for students.
