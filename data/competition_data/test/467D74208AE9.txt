The author is definetley fond of studying Venus and different ways to get there. The author goes into detail on how Venus is a very different but at the same time similar to Earth's atmosphere. The problem is that there has not been a single succesful mission to Venus, which means scientists have no concrete evidence that humans can survive there.

The author stated, "More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anyhting else, from a distance"(6). This is very important because if the scientists can not take samples then no one will be able to figure out if humans could actually survive on Venus. The sooner scientists get to test the surface of Venus, the sooner humans will find out if they are able to live on Venus in the future. Venus is similar to Earth for a few reassons for example, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"(4). This quote is discussing that Venus was once the most Earth like planet because they both had very similar atmospheres and features. As the quote mentioned Venus was covered largely with oceans, Earth is 70% + covered in ocean. If signs of life on Earth are possible from having many oceans it is logical to predict that Venus had life in it's oceans at one time.

In conclusion, It is still a problem that there has not been one succesful mission to Venus, resulting in scientists having no concrete evidence that humans could survive on Venus in the future. Once there is an invention that allows scientists to get to Venus's surface and take samples. It will be a quick process from there to find out if humans can survive on Venus's atmosphere. The fact that scientists have found that Venus once had a lot of space covered in oceans. This can help one predict that there was also some living organisms on Venus's surface. If the conditions are still the same scientists could test the area to figure out if it would be possible for humans to live there in the future.
