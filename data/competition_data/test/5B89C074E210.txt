Dear Principal,

I Think this position should take place. But, for only a certain amount of time. Maybe, For only about a hour. Children like me, should help around this community, because some people are just changing around, littering or not helping their children with homework or with school. Us children have the right too help around this community.

It may take time away from our social life, but at least were helping. Making things around us better then what it is now. We can probably get a treat out of it, because were doing the right things.

Some parents now-a-days, are working, and can't have time to help their children with homework or some people aren't really paying attention to what their doing and just throw things onto the ground. It isn't right, because it's making this earth unhealthy. But, if we had some children helping around, we can make this earth better.

We can basically, make new friends, while helping around .. and still help around. Have fun while working. It'll be better for earth, and people around us. People will start seeing new changes around them. We'll probably see more trees, more flowers blooming, different colors around us, and healthy water.

One day, this will all hopefully take place. Students, and different people can participate with this service. New changes, and new things around us. Everything will end out turning great.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
