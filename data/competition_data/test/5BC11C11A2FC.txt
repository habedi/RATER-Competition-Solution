This Face from Mars is just a natural landform. It can't be created from aliens because aliens do not exist. Also, no one has ever seen a real alien before. They could just be making this up for the entertainment and attention. The Face even looks like a human head. I can prove that by the evidence that NASA has.

The Face even resembles a human head. There's shadowing that makes the Face a natural landform. The shadowing gives illusion of eyes, a nose, and mouth. According to paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of web surfers all over the world were waiting for the image to appear on a JPL web site. It revealed that it was a natural landform and not an alien monument.

It may look like the Face was created by aliens but it is really doubtful. There is not that much evidence that it could've been an alien's marking. Perhaps, it could've been the wind and water making rocks collide to form the Face. There could be missing evidence that NASA might've not catched, but NASA does have evidence that can say it was just a natural landform.
