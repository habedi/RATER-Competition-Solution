Hi im luke and I think you should join the seagoing cowboy's I have really been inspired and had fun there is a bunch of neat thing's to see you can ride a boat for free but I will tell you if you dont want to do a little hard work this job is probally not right for you but if youre aperson who like's helping other's or you're not scared to get your hand's dirty this would be a good job because we see alot of happy face's and smiles. And that is because we bring people food livestock and make the hard time's easier for them because everyone want's to be treated the same so do it and help. But if youre a person who want's to do work to be rewarded then you still might want to help we get to go over sea's and see a bunch of exotic animal's elsewhere plus vacation spot's like touring a excavated castle or see the panamal canal and taking a gondola ride in Venice Italy. But the price is not paying a bunch of money but doing a little bit of work and on board you can do thing's like volleyball reading and ping-pong championship's.

But like I said I can see where someone else might come from because the work isn't alway's easy like feeding the animal's an watering them alot cleaning out the stall's but like I said everything has it's ups and downs and turn around's and some people would enjoy my work.

But if you want to try it out come on down to the sea cowboy's and have a good time.
