I remember being in the yearbook club in 7th grade and enjoying the experience, well this doesnt carry for everyone. Forcing kids into extracurricular activities wouldn't be fair, people can be busy after school, parents can't pick them up, and they just not find interest in these activities or be in ones outside of the school.

Firstly, every kid at one point has had chores or are still doing chores and from experience their time consuming which could easily lead to a kid being to busy for a club or sport, kids could also have part time jobs like babysitting or mowing the neighbors lawn, and they could have a job that requires them after school. Chores are vital to keep a house running in most cases. Things like doing the dishes so dishes don't build is a major one for a nicer and cleaner house, and maybe its the kids job to do them after school. Another issue with this is the fact that some kids babysit and other small jobs this means they have things to do at certain times and places. Some kids in middle school and high school have jobs and can't stay after due to schedule.

Secondly, most parents have jobs and with those jobs comes times where maybe they cant pick up their kid, this means that the kid would be stuck at the school waiting or have to go alone which based on where you are could be unsafe. Family members like a grandma or grandpa could be busy or not able to drive which could make them unavailable to pick kids up after school. Kids couldn't get home on their own, walking could be an option but some parents don't want their kids walking due to safety issues or concerns.

Lastly, there are some clubs and sports that the school doesn't host that kids could go to, like another team outside of the school teams or the clubs might be a out of town or start right after school. Sports are hosted outside of schools like some teams for soccer or basket ball, so the kid could already be on a preexisting team and this probably wouldn't count to the required amount. Finally, some kids could dislike or not find interest in the activities available leaving them either forced into a sport or forcing themselves into a sport they don't like.

In conclusion, the idea of required extracurricular activities sounds pointless, kids could be busy with work, might not be able to work with their parents schedule, and they could be involved with something else outside of school and might not like the selection given. the idea of a extracurricular activity being required sounds like it could mess with peoples out of school jobs and or things, plus parents would have to be involved and most can't all the time.
