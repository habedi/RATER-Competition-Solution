Dear principal

As a student i believe that phone should be expectable during school hours.

I believe in this because a number of reasons.

Cell phones are not a hazard if they are not out during class time so they are not disturbing anyone at all, also if there is an emergency(like a fire) it would be safe to have a cellular device on your person at the time of the crisis.

It mainly would be used for appropriate and safety reasons only and could only help not harm students unless used improperly. i understand that if there is a test it could be considered cheating but either trust in your students or ask to take the cell phone off his or her person.

If the phones become a problem for a certain student only take away the privilege for that student. It would not be fair to the student body if you change the policy.

Students could also use this policy helpfully to arrange for transportation .

understanding of disciplinary action is high because cell phones can detach people of their study habit's. during free time cell phone can be absolutely expectable.

As a student i support my theory and my statements and i hope you do too.

yours truly:
