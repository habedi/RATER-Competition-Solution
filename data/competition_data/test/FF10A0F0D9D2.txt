Nasa is good at its job. Give them a break, they cant keep trying to gain information about this so called face for everyone to see. Atleast there giving you a possible explanation of what it could be. You guys just keep saying things you know nothing about, nasa is the scientist here. Plus theres no such things as aliens.

Who would even think that there could possibly aliens on mars. Nasa is for the study on space, and just to think yo guys think you know more then them is ridiculous. I understand you have your beliefs, but sometimes you treally just ahev to sit back and say is this logica. If your at the point where you say yeah this is absoulutely right, theres obviously some mental issues going on.

So baed on things in this passge such as the images, you never know the nasa company could b sneaky and photoshop the picture. Just for the controversy thats going on now. In the first picture it resembles nothing but a land form like structure. So as i was saying in the first paragraph stop trying to get attention on some so little.
