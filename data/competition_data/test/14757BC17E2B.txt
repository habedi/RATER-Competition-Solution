Unmasking the Face of Mars is just a natural landform. These things happen all the time it could be caused from a volcanic eruption or even from a meteor. All planets at least have some kind of indention in it. This doesn't mean an alien created it. This kind of stuff just doesn't happen to planets either. It could also happen right here on earth. Really no one has proved that aliens are even real and until that happens im not going to believe that they are. If you think about it how would aliens even get to planet to planet. How are they supposed to make that big of an indention. There really isn't any givin facts about any of this really no one really knows.

In the article they say the rock formation resembles a human head which is formed by shadows giving the illusion eyes, nose, and mouth. If ou really think about it how could you get all that from just a picture thats not even really close up to it. You would have to get a really good picture that is close up and examine it abunch to get that kind of thought. Maybe the rock for mation just created over the years. That kind of stuff really does happen the older the thing gets. Really anything couldv'e happened to it. I really don't understand, people also could be just making that up for some attention or something you never know. Very few scientists believe that the Face was an alien artifact.

After thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting whe the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

After all that research the NASAS has done they finally figured out that it really wasn't an alien artifact. This should be a lesson to everyone that is reading this, you can't believe everything that everyone says to you or anyone else. People do this all the time time to just get attention. Really if you think about it they like to make people believe something that is not true because after its all over they make the people that did believe them disapointed. They thinks its funny.
