Richard Nion, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole and other companies have all agreed to abolish the Electoral College and I to agree for many reasons. One of the major issue is that the voters don't know what really happens to thier vote. Another issue to add is that ''the electoral collage is unfair, outdated, and irrational".

Do the citizens that go and vote for their candidate actually choose for the candidate's electors? In the text is states that not only do I vote for candidate's electors but also '' help choose the state's electors when you vote for the president''. This meaning that my vote counts for several things, but was I aware? Maybe not because I simply think I'm voting for a candidate running for presidenty not the candidate's elector. The Electoral College was ment for a compromise between Congress and Citizens not all these extra people.

''This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could loose again''. Certainly this doesn't makes sence because how could the winner of the votes loose? Which is one of the reasons why the the Electoral College is unfair. Also in the beggining of the article it's said that '' A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President''. Meaning that the president already has an advance in the votes. I think that the Electoral College process should be gone for its unfairity and be replaced to a new way of election.

In the new way of electing our president should be in a few steps and also not worrying about the candidate already having an advanced amount of votes. Instead of the votes going place to place they should just be in the state and counted for equaly no ajustments, then after the election send to Congress or the National Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election.

In conclusion the electoral College should be taken out permantly and be replaced by a new way or process when it comes to the citizens votes and the election of the cadidates.
