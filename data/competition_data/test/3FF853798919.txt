To whom it may concern,

I think principals should let students keep their phones with them at all times in case of an emergency. I think that because there has been a lot of things that have happened in the past where someone goes into the school and starts shooting everybody. So if one of these days that happens someone that has their phone with them can call 911. Although, I hope this doesn't happen anytime soon. I also think that if a student is caught texting their teacher may have the right to take the phone away until further notice. I think principals should allow students to keep their phones with them at all times, EXCEPT during a test, or TAKS test.

Students should be held responsible if they are caught texting or calling someone during class, and the teacher takes their phone away. I also believe that teachers should NOT text during class. Because they are just giving students bad examples. Therefore, teachers should also get into trouble if they are texting or calling people from their cell phones!

Sincerely,
