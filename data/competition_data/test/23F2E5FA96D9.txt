In the article the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables compters to identify human emotions. I Would like to have computers like that becasue I would love to know my emotions everyday. I'm pretty sure a lot of people would like to know every now and then. So, the computers are going to tell you what your emotions are and tell you the percent to how happy you are, or how disgusted, fearful, angry, and many more. The computers can calculate anyones emotion whenever they would like to know.

The computers are there for people when they want to know there emotions. Like when they are having a bad day and they want to see how sad they are. All they have to do is go to the computer to find out. If I had that computer I would most deffinetly go to it.

But since I don't have it I just figure it out on my own by just relaxing and minding my own business.

Whoever came up with the human emotion computer is very smart becasue you know how many people would go to that computer to see how upset or how angry they are. LIke expecially, when they are mad at ther boyfriend or girlfriend. Maybe they wil get mad enough to go the computer and realize that, that person isn't worth getting mad at. So, I do think those computers will come in handy.
