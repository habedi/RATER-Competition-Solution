Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard that you were reconsidering, the schools cell phone policy. I think that you should go with the 1st policy. That students can use there cell phone during lunch and other free times, but have them turned off during there classes. I think that you should pick the first policy because, if students could use there cell phones during lunch and there free time, then there wouldn't be so many of students who get there phone taken up during class.

I know that the office people get annoyed when there is a lot of people that come into the office to call there parents to tell them what time they get out of school, or to tell them that they forgot there athletic clothes, because I was an Office Aide last semester. If you let students use there phone during there lunch or in there free time then they can call or text there parents and handle whatever type of business they need to and not get in trouble. If you choose the 2nd policy then everything would just stay the same. People would always be in the office waiting in line to call there parents to tell them something. There would be a ton of cell phones in the office every day because teachers took them up. I remember last year when there where a bunch of 6th grade girls who had forgotten that they had a history test and they where all inside the locker room texting there parents to see if they could bring there History books up here, then one of the coaches went inside and she took up all of there phones and there where about 30 of them that got taken up. Then whenever you have students phones taken up you have to dill with all of the anger parents that come up here and wonder why there child's phone was taken up and then they have to pay 15 dollars to get it back. I think that you should pick the first policy to keep the students happy and to avoid all the drama that would happen if you chose policy 2.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
