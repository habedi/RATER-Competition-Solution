In my opinion , I say that us students should have the offer too have school projects. The examples im gonna provide is too say why we should have these projects over the summer because they can give us a topic about what we did over the summer as a project. for examples , this can bring so many students grades up and ill teach us about what each students did over the summer by looking at there project by including pictures and so many more details. Also , this will be a fun activity that everyone will enjoy around the world.

In addition , you wouldnt really need summer school anymore for some other students. This can provide them too move up to the next grade level by providing them with these school projects. All you gotta do is give them a topic about what they did over summer and it can most likely make them succeed , all they gotta do is provide pictures , details , and have something too do with the subjects that they learn in school such as english , math , and science included in the project. it can bring us all together and closer as a school if we did something like this.

Furthermore , you can even provide a reward when school starts again. It can be a first , second , and a third place winner , the prize should be of any students choosing such as a ten dollar gift card too their favorite fast food restaurant. this will make students want too try even harder and wanna compete with each other of who got the best and coolest project out of everyone. also , we can all get in front of the class to show off are talent and decorations too all the teachers and staff. To continue , this would be a huge opportunity too us students that we will mighty enjoy.

In conclusion , I have provide details and examples on why this type of thing should happen all around the country. it can bring so many communities and schools all around the world and provided students a way too stay out of trouble and a cool activity for everyone too do as a project. hopefully staff and teachers look in too this activity cause might I say , I would enjoy too be apart off designing a project of what I did over the summer.
