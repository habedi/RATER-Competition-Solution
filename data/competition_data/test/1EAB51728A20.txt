Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that if you decide to change our school's cell phone policy, then you should choose to allow students to have phones at school but only use them outside of class. I think that not allowing students to have their phones at all is an awful idea. We need phones at school in case something goes wrong. What if I get hurt in an area of the building where nobody is? I need a way to contact someone to let them know where I am and what has happened so I can get help. Also, having a phone at school is necessary because my parents might try to contact me and tell me something important such as schedule changes, family emergencies, and so on. If I do not have a phone, then I cannot know something that is very important until it might be too late.

I know that you think students will use their phones in class when they should be learning and paying attention to the teacher. All you need to solve this problem are stricter teachers who will not allow this to happen and will catch it if it does, and your students to have a sense of honor. Most of us know what the right thing to do is, we just do not always do it because of peer pressure, desire for popularity, a good laugh, etc. We have enough time to use our phones when it is allowed, so why would we need to risk getting in trouble when we could just wait until class is over? I believe that if you give us the privilege to have our cell phones with us at school, we will obey your guidelines very strictly and will not let you down.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
