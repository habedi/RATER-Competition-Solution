Do you agree or disagree that student should or shouldn't join a activity. I disagree that student shouldn't need to join a activity, because the students need to have fun with family and friends and they need time to finishÂ homework and get enough sleep that most don't it.

They need to have fun in their life time. An examples is that they go to playground when ever they want to go because to helps the students to lose energy and feel alive as a very young adult. An other examples is that they need time to be with loved one and friends because to spend time with them and feel happy around to enjoy life to the fullest. That why I think that kids need time to them self.

They need time to do homework to get out of trouble. An examples is that they don't we worried about it because they did it the night before it. An other examples is that student feel stress out about it because when they get home from their after school activity they have to finish their work late at night and their parents can get worried about learning. That why I think to take all homework away.

I still disagree with the after school activity that the principal made it for the students. Kids should have time for their self and other and to feel stress free about all work. I think they should take all after school activity and only keep important activity both students and teachers.
