I believe that this is a good policy that you must have at least a B average to participate in sports or other school activities. I think this is a good policy because for some people high school is difficult enough when your not busy and all those programs can distract you from doing good in school. Sports can be distracting because instead of studying for a test you might have to go to practice or go to a game.

Another reason why this is a good policy is because in sports you don't always make it on a college team or a pro team and then you have to get a regular job. If you didn't get good grades in high school then you it's harder for you to find a job in this job market. Companies would much rather hire a person that got a B or A average than a person that got a C or D average who played sports in high school. That's just how it works just because it's much more of a struggle to find a job now than in the twentieth century.

Also this is a good idea because it could set an example for some younger athletes that want to continue to play sports that they have to keep their grades up in order to play. If they didn't decide to use this policy then some people might not even try to get good grades and just worry about sports.

There's one thing bad about the policy though. I believe that they should wait a while before they pass this policy to give some students sometime to learn some healthier studying methods. If they pass it in the middle of the school year most students will not have enough time to make the change.

Overall i think that this policy is good and won't be surprised if it does get passed considering how so many politicians are raising issues of how the nation's kids are learning
