Do you believe it's fair for students to choose whatever project they want? Students shouldn't be able to choose their own project, because they could be choosing the easiest one or the least amount of work. They could also be doing something they've already done, so they wouldn't be learning anything new. Although some might agree otherwise, personal experiences, other students, and teachers prove that students should not be choosing their summer projects. .

For example, personal experiences, I've learned more stuff through teacher designed summer projects. When I was assigned a book to read over summer, I thought it would be boring and I wouldn't be able to finish it. The type of book that I had to read was not my type, but I ended up loving it and was interested in finishing it. If my teacher didn't assign this project to me I would have never found out I was interested in these types of books and I would have never learned some things not only from the book, but about me. Some may disagree with this, but teacher designed summer projects help students be more responsible and get them to learn more information.

Shown through other students, some take advantage of teachers who give them a student designed project and they choose something they really know and don't have to learn anything new. Some students don't like to learn anything or do anything related to school and they end up choosing the easiest way out of that school work. In this case those students who didn't want to learn anything end up with less knowledge then others in their class. By giving the whole class the same summer project, they will be all on the same page next year when they go over it and everyone will understand.

Lastly teachers, they all have a different mind set, so every teacher teaches differently. A teacher could be letting their student's do anything they want for a project in class, out of class, or for summer. If one does do that, some student's may have a hard time and some may like it better that way and if they do the students may have a different amount of work on the projects which wouldn't be fair to them. Some may say otherwise; however, a teacher designed summer project will help the students learn and help the be able to work on their own. This will also help they get ready for work, so they would be able to do things on their own.

This is important because some teachers don't think it affects students, but most of the time it does, students may take advantage with teachers providing a student designed summer project. When a student was able to choose all of their past summer projects and then one year they can't choose it. They would struggle and wouldn't have a teacher to help them because it's summer time. If a student is able to choose their projects all the time they wouldn't be learning anything new. This explains why student's shouldn't shouldn't be able to choose their summer projects shown through personal experiences, other students, and teachers.Â
