Imagine you just finished yearbook club and you're waiting for a ride, but you receive a text message from your parent guardian saying that they can't make it. Some parents may not have the time to drive you to soccer practice, or give you a ride home from swimming. Students should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because it adds more stress, gives you less time to complete homework, and fulfill after school duties.

Joining an extracurricular activity can add more stress. Parents can work late and may not be able to pick up their kids from the designated location. This adds stress the the parent because now they have to ask someone without notice to come get you. Some of the activities can begin late so students do not have enough time to study their school work. Students now begin to worry if they get a bad grade on a assignment, or if they passed the test. Also, not all parents own or access a car. Kids need to pay for a bus or a taxi in order to get to their location, but parents might not have the money to pay the cost of a bus. Participating in extra curricular activities doesn't just add stress to kids, but to parent as well.

In addition, students have after school duties to accomplish. Both your parents might work late, so they left your younger sibling with you to watch over. At a time like this, students do not have plan to attend extracurricular activities. As you are heading into high school, collage is less than 4 years away, so you might be working a job. You should be focusing on the next chapter of your life, that determines your future, instead of going to band practice. The most important thing a child's life is their education. Kids should study and revise their notes and getting good grades, but extra curricular activities can get in the way of school. Students start thinking about other unnecessary stuff and lose their focus, missing important information the teacher is presenting. Students are required to complete home duties and just don't have the time to play fun activities.

Playing after school activities, like sports, can give you exercise instead of staying home all day. Kids may just sit at home watch television and playing video games. But not all people are skilled at a specific activity that other are, or may not be interested in the available activities. A student may sign up for something he has no interest in, with no experience. This can make them insecure or fear judgment from other peers. An extracurricular activity should be something people enjoy, and not have to be forced.

Extra curricular activities should be a personal choice. If students are forced to participate in these activities it can decrease your time for studying, give you more stress than you need, and won't finish your home duties. Extra curricular activities can be fun, but it should not be mandatory.
