Do you feel that you woud want your emotions read to you everytime you sit down at a computer? I do because , I feel that technology that can read your emotions would be good for everyone , say someone is depressed but covers it up with a smile , this type of technology could help lots of people find peace with their emotions. The author says "For instance , you can porbably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking at her face.", the author is absouletly right , people show more emotion in their facial expressions then they think.. your face says it all."They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one." It is so very improtanat that poeple feel that they can to anyone they trust with their emotions, emotions are something big that run through you 24/7. You can not stop emotions from coming and going.

The author then says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," "Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor." I feel that the computer recognizing emotion in children at school is a big deal , so many children get bored during class because its always the same routie that they to everyday , nothing changes for them. If more teachers would fcus on the lesson and keeping their students awake then school would be a lot better.

In conclusion , that is why i feel that the Facial Action Coding System is a wonderful idea.
