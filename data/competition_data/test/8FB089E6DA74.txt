After a long agrument with one of my co-workers deciding whether or not the Face on Mars was made by the aliens or the picture was a picture of a natural landform we both had different opinions on what we thought it really was.

My co-worker tried to convince me that aliens put the Face on Mars. He told me that by the looks of the picture it looked as if it was an alien artifact. He then stated that you could barely tell from the picture what exactly it is.

I told him I thought it was a natural landform that either looks like a butte or a messa. I also stated that the picture actually shows a Martian that kinda looks like a butte or messa. I then stated that the picture reminds me somewhat of a Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.

He then decided that we should try and attempt to take a better and that we would decide from there. He sent Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team to snap a photo ten times as sharper as the last one. He then decided that I was right and that he was wrong because when the image first appeared on web surfers it revealed a natural landform. The picture also revealed that there was no alien monument to be seen after all.

Inconclusion, after the long agrument we both agreed with my opinion. So it turns out that my co-workers opinion wasn't true. And we found out after taking the last photo that the Face of Mars came to be a natural landform.
