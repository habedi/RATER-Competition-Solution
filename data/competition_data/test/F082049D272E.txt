I would disagree I don't think you should have to participate in extracurricular activity and I'll tell you my reason why I disagree.

First reason It should be your choice if you want or don't want to participate in extracurricular activity. Somebody shouldn't decide how you make your own choice because you should be able to have the choice to do or not to do extracurricular activity.

Second reason why you shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activity is because you could be already busy with something else they shouldn't need anymore work or pressure on them. Also this would mean you stay at school longer time because of extracurricular activity.

Third reason it will be harder to get in to the extracurricular activity that you want because since every student have to choose one it will get full much faster then normal. So that mean if you choose something you do like you'll have a unlikely chance of getting it and then get something you don't like.

Fourth reason you can't find something that you'll want to choose for a extracurricular activity because you could get bored very easily. It would also be hard to choose if you are also very picky because you don't have many choices to choose from.

Fifth and final reason no one can come and get you after your extracurricular activity. A lot of parent have jobs that make them work late and then they don't have time to pick you up and that a problem because extracurricular activity are after school.

So these are reason why I don't think you should have to participate in extracurricular activity.
