I think this technology that they want to use is acceptable, Technology is our future and as we begin to have advances like this is going to be very good. I feel like this machine will save teachers a lot of time because they already have a lot to do. Another reason this is going to help us is because this computer will know when you are happy or sad because when a kid goes to use the computer it will take them to a site in which they feel most comfortable. The more people get used to this the better because then the people that made these computers will begin to make more of them because people will begin to want to buy more of them. There can also be disadvantages to this because some people will begin to not make communication with other people they will just think it's okay to talk to a computer. I still feel like this is a great piece of technology but they should adjust it so that people won't just want to be with a computer all day. This is just of one of the few steps we become closer to each improvement in our environment. This is why I feel like this machine would be good to have in classrooms.
