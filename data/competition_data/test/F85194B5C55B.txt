Sea Cowboys, when I think of the sea cowboys I think about boats and shiping animalis and food, sulplies to places that need them so they can thrive and grow back. durring world war two germany had been left in ruines so a grop called the

{UNRRA} formed a grope called the Sea Cowboys.

why should you join the sea cowboys first of all you can see places that you never seen before. Such as China, Germany, and italy. Luke Bomberger has seen many amazing sights such as castles Vience Italyand the panama canal on his why to china.

You can learn new things such as how animails defend them self, what they eat and how to take care of it. you can learn about the sea and all the diffrent types of life there are in the sea, and about all the new palces that see while your eploring the seas.

You can make new friends while your bored your ship. you can play games and chat with them while you on watch and, while your done unloading the ship and when, your hanging out were the animals wrere. You can talk amongst your fellow Sea Cowboys and you can also play games.

This is why I think you should be part of the Sea Cowboys what do you think, about the Sea Cowboys
