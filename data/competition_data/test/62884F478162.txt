I think that students should be able to have cell phones during school but should be turned off during classes. The only times the students will be allowed to have there cell phones out is during the morning, lunch, and during any breaks that they have.

Having cell phones out during classes is a distraction towards the student because if the teacher is giving a lesson that is really important and they students are not listening, then the student is out of luck if the notes that they were supposed to take were on a test. If the students have there phones out during math class, they could be cheating on a test or an assignment that the teacher has given them.

Students should only be able to use there cell phones if they don't feel good or if they are in trouble. They should only be able to call there parents for those reasons only or if they forgot something at there house. But if they are using that cell phone to text there friends because they are bored, then that cell phone should be taken away by a teacher or the principal.

The students are not getting the education they need if they are on there cell phone throughout all of there classes or for the entire school year. If the students are not paying attention to there teacher and there teacher says to put the cell phone away and they don't listen, them that's when the teacher should taken there cell phone away from them. There is no need for them to be on that cell phone when they are in class. Some students are failing classes because they are not paying attention to the lesson the teacher is trying to tell the students.

The students are not going to pay attention if the teacher does not do anything about the cell phone problems. The students will just keep ignoring them and ignoring them. That is no way for a teacher to be treated by a student. So, they can have there cell phones nut not during classes. If students don't follow the rule then just take away there phone and have there parents come in and get it so parents know why they got there phone taken away at school.
