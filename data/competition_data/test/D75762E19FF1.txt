Accidents occur more often than we think, especially while driving.

Just think, accidents can happen in the blink of an eye.

There are hundreds of different ways for accidents to occur while driving but I want to focus on texting while driving.

Let's just keep it real, it is difficult to drive and access a phone at the same time, at least that is some multi-tasking skills that no one should try to master.

In this essay, I will be discussing three reasons why texting is not appropriate while driving: distractions, swerving, and all reasons could lead to a potential crash.

Texting while driving becomes an obstruction to other drivers when you are at a stop sign or red light, you are literally watching a phone while others are waiting for you to proceed.

This can lead to people yelling and honking horns just get your attention.

It is just right to respect the fact that there are others on the road, just maybe they want to proceed forth without unnecessary setbacks.

It is safe to try to focus on the road or signs at all times, after all safety should be the main concern for any driver.

Next, there is also the fact that you can easily swerve lanes.

Swerving lanes can be life-threatening.

If you swerve lanes, you can cause several accidents at one time.

I have actually had an experience with something like this.

My mom was texting, when all of a sudden the car began to shift across to the lane, we wound up causing several accidents.

Last but not least, there could be a potential crash.

Obviously, the main reason for not texting while driving is crashing.

I am almost positive that there is some high percentage of crashes caused by text.

I don't have evidence, but it is kind of common sense.

I mean it is difficult to look down at a phone and try to drive at the same time, "it's an accident waiting to happen" so to speak.

In conclusion, the real reason not to text and drive is because you can crash and die.

There is no need to sugarcoat the obvious because the end results can end in death.

I try not to text while I am driving because I just started driving and my skills are limited.

I would hate to crash into an innocent person.

Let's all practice being more careful when driving.
