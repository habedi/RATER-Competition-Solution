In this passage there are several pros and cons about studying and examining Venus. Venus does not sound like a very delightful planet to visit although it has many Earth-like features. Although Mercury is the closest to the sun, Venus is way hotter. With all of the dangers and negative thoughts about Venus, it could also be very important to visit and get a closer look at the differences and similarities that Venus has with Earth. We could also think of exploring what Venus is like as a challenge and advantage that almost everyone are not capable of doing such. Studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit because in life getting past negative thoughts and all of the cons that go on, will lead to many advantages and everyone is capable of getting over them and challenging themselves to exceed their limit on whatever goal they might have in mind. There are also many ways of examining Venus in a safe and scientifically way such as, using common sense from the fact of wearing the right clothes to using the right thought process.

Studying something extrodinary and out of the Earth is something most people might enjoy. Examining Venus and what it is like there does not seem all bad. Yes, the planet does have a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide that blankets it, but we also have to think about the fact that it does have very many Earth-like features. Venus has things such as, a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. According to this passage, it could also be our nearest option for a planetary visit yet a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. Venus has more cons than pros but if we think about what positive outcomes we could possibly get from the negativity, then I feel as if everything will end up fine. This could lead to arguments but in my opinion I feel like studying Venus would be a once in a lifetime experience that not everyone can get the chance of doing so even though it is a challenging place to examine.

Also in this passage it states that, our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors and that means with everyone's wonders and curious mindsets, studying Venus could be a possible thing that happens in the future. If everyone were to not focus on every little negative thing or every bad thing that happens, then someone will eventually go big and beyond others mindsets and goals. Temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet, but in the end if something major were to happen to any human then that will be the only way of knowing the truth. People could sit here and talk about all of the negativity that Venus has but if only one person has ever done it how do we know that these "facts" are true? We don't nessciarily know if anyone has ever went out of their way to study Venus but if they did it probably happened a very long time ago. It will take at least more than one strong human body to explore and actually bring back the true facts but studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and most people's negative mindset.
