During the summer would you students want to do the same old slide presentation about a topic you don't care about? Would you rather have your teacher choose the assignment and the way you do the assignment or would you rather choose the assignment yourself and the way you get to do the assignment? I think summer projects should be student-designed instead of them being teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because, the students could choose something they are interested in, the students will actually finish the project on time and the projects would have a more creative thought.

The first reason why I think summer projects should be student-designed is that the students can actually pick a topic they are interested in. Teenagers are not going to care about anything if they are not interested in it. If we got to choose what our project can be about and how we want to do it, I promise more students will actually do the project. Also it is the time of the year where there is no school and everyone is out doing something. People could be out on vacation, playing different sports, working and all different kinds of things. Everyone should have a good topic that is interesting to them. The teachers usually gives us a boring topic we would have to look up on the internet or a database and then we would have to research about it. The teachers make us do that basically the whole year so at least in the summer let us choose what the project should be about.

My next reason as to why I think us students should be able to have control over summer projects is that most students will actually do it and get it done on time. This reason kind of connects with the first reason but more people would turn it in on time because, we get to choose how the project is set up. Also the final product will come out better because they actually care about the topic. Since the project is based on how we want it, more students will put more effort into the project and getting it done on time. They might even add more than you expected and exceed your expectations. Summer projects will be ten times easier and more fun to do

My last reason as to why I think that we should be allowed to control our own summer projects is that there would be more creativity among the students. Most of the projects we get in school is an essay or a PowerPoint slide. Very boring and basic ways to do assignments, but imagine if students got to control the way they do their project. People would be doing edited videos, speeches and maybe even bring in a tri fold, and that is not even half of the ways students can do their projects. Some students can be so creative when it comes to school assignments, but all the teachers wants us to do some boring essay or slide show. When students get to be more creative I think they tend to do better on projects. Also like I said before, it will be a summer project, which means it will be in the summer and students will have plenty of time to get the tools and everything they need to do the project. There are various ways a student can do a project.

Also some teachers might think why would they let their students do a project about topics that has nothing to do with the class their taking. Some people might think a teacher-designed summer project, the traditional way, is better to have than a student-designed summer project. I understand where those people might be coming from, but at the same time, I wouldn't just throw them course based assignments already when the class hasn't even started yet. The teachers have not even taught them anything or even seen them, but they want to give them a summer assignment about something no one has taught us yet. Getting to know how your students are and what they are capable of is more important, in my opinion. A project about how a student's summer went can tell a lot about the student and If I was a teacher I would want to know how my students are and how they do assignments so I would plan around that so I could make the school year be a whole lot smoother. I wouldn't just throw students an assignment about something they haven't learned about yet.

In conclusion, I think that student-designed summer projects are better than teacher-designed summer projects because students will actually get it done on time, there would be more creativity among the students and the students would have the liberty to choose any type of topic they want to choose. Yes teacher-designed summer projects might have some good points, but overall it is better to have student-designed summer projects. It wouldn't be no more boring PowerPoint slides all the time, it would be more fun, creative and interesting projects for when the school year begins.
