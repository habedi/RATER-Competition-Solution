Through new technology and innovation, distance learning has become an option for education.

Education is often one of the first fields to benefit from technology and this is an exciting opportunity for educational innovation.

Students are faced with lots of challenges and difficulties and distance learning is a solution to many of those challenges.

Students could benefit from distance learning since it would give students more options to take other classes through resolving schedule conflicts, it would relieve some student stress, and it would allow for more flexibility in inclement weather and emergency situations.

Distance learning gives students more options in class choice, allowing students to benefit from classes they are passionate about.

Especially in smaller high schools, many students are restricted in their class choices because of limited class offerings and scheduling conflicts.

Distance learning would allow students to work on their own time and free time for classes that are offered less frequently.

Giving students the opportunity to take other classes they are more passionate about is essential to student engagement and education as a whole.

Distance learning would also allow students who can handle it to take classes outside of the regular school day.

If students are not able to fit a class into their regular schedule, an online class would be a great solution to free up space.

In addition, if a class is not offered by a teacher at a certain school, an online course would be a way that students could take classes they are truly passionate about.

Online learning gives students the opportunity to take classes they are more passionate about and gives students many more options in class choice.

Additionally, distance learning would help relieve student stress.

Students are faced by lots of stress and pressure and by allowing students to work on courses in their own time, student stress would be significantly relieved.

When students are able to work on classes when it is convenient for them, more free time is available for students to work on other activities.

Time management is also an important skill that distance learning could help teach.

Strict class schedules cause stress among students and by allowing for students to work on their own time, courses can be more personalized to the students needs and schedule.

Many students suffer from learning disabilities and by allowing for students to work at their own pace through online courses, many challenges caused by learning disabilities may be overcome.

Online classes would help students through allowing them to work at their own pace, on their own time.

In emergency and inclement weather situations, distance learning could be extremely useful.

Many courses fall behind schedule in the winter when school must be canceled for snow or other weather.

Online learning could allow for courses to stay on track when it is unsafe to travel to a campus.

In rare situations in which schools are destroyed such as tornadoes or earthquakes, online learning may be the only solution for classes to stay on track while the school is repaired or rebuilt.

In the case of a mass virus outbreak such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak, distance learning may also be the only solution.

Colleges such as University of Georgia are already having teachers prepare online courses if classes must be canceled due to this outbreak.

Distance learning allows classes to stay on track and is often the only solution in case of a virus outbreak, inclement weather, or unsafe conditions.

Distance learning solves many of the challenges education faces at both the high school and college level such as student stress and difficult conditions posed by emergency situations and allows for students to have more opportunities to pursue classes they are interested in.

One of the problems that is pointed out in distance learning is the difficulty of getting one-on-one help from a teacher.

This problem can be easily overcome through "hybrid classes," which are taught partly in class and partly online, and office hours hosted by teachers.

These programs have been a huge success at North Carolina State University and have been able to relieve student stress and allow more class choice.

Distance learning is the the future of education and there is no reason that it should not be implemented now.
