In this article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" is about how the author describes new technology called the Facial Action Coding System which identifys the human emotions. This technology shouldn't read the students' facial expression. It shouln't read a students facial expressions because first off there's no reason to do it at a school especially. Second of all there's more other emotions than happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness to tell of your face or mood. And the last reason is there's other new technology that can copy the 3-D face plus it could be dangerous.

First off, there's no reason to do it in a school. Mainly because at a school you learn about different subjects like math, english, science, etc. I do not think this is some "lab experiment" either. Although the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, and has all the 44 major muscles in the model to move like the human muscles. Do we really need all that just to tell what your facial expression is saying.

Second of all there's other emotions than happiness,surprised, anger, fear, and sadness. Also there is lots of names on your face of what shows the emotion you are in. Orbicularis oris tightens your lip which shows anger, the zygomatic major lifts up the corner of your mouths,oculi pars palpabraeus make the crow feet, the zygomatic major is having your mouth stretched sideways while the risorius is a different muscle. According to the article you have to make those "fake smile" that has all those to test your facial expression.

The last reason is because there's new studies that basically copies your facial expression or movents to a thing on the IPhone X called the Animoji. Animoji is basically an emoji coming to life and it can talk, copy your facial expression , and if you move your head around it'll move it's head around. Plus it's also a 3-D model as well. If the Animoji see's that your eyebrows are up or down, the corner of your mouth is lifted, or that your eyes are squinted it will copy every movement. Its dangerous beacuse apparently once it captures your face, basically the government or polices will know where to find you or how you look like all because of that.

Those are my reasons why this technology should not be used on students is because first off there is no reason to do it at a school, second of all there's other facial expressions other than happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and my last reason is because there's new studies and it could be dangerous fo student.
