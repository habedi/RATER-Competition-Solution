At the end of the school year, students dread the idea of a summer project. This project becomes another assignment that students procrastinate until the week before school. When their teacher assigns a summer project, students tend to dislike the subject of the project. This results in the students not wanting to complete their project, which leads to students putting less effort into the project. Students should be able to design their own projects so that they can choose a topic that they are interested in and can design a plan that suits their needs. However, teachers should still be involved as mentors so that they can guide their students and provide useful resources.

When students are assigned projects, many complain that they do not like the project because it is boring. If students could design their own project, they would be able to choose a topic that interests them. This would benefit the student because they have the option to study something that could help them learn about something that would benefit them. For example, if a student is interested in pursuing a career in the medical field, they would have the option to choose a project that studies medicine. This is helpful because it allows the student to study something that will help them in other subjects. In addition, students would be able to choose a project that suits their strengths. When teachers assign one project to the whole class, the project might benefit some students more than others. However, if the student can design their own project, they will be able to choose a project that they can succeed in. Also, when students choose a project that interests them, they will be more likely to complete it. When a student does not like their project, they tend to procrastinate it until the last minute. If students were able to choose a project that they like, they will enjoy working on it and therefore be more likely to complete it. By giving students the option to pick a project that the are interested in, students will be able to do a project that is enhanced by their strengths and suits their needs.

Another common complaint students have when they are assigned a summer project is that they do not have the time to complete it. If students could design their own project, they would be able to design a project that suits their schedule. This would make them more accountable for it. During the summer, many students have busy schedules. Most are occupied with summer jobs, internships, and vacations. This makes it difficult for a student to complete a project that is not compatible with the time that they have. However, if students are able to design a project that suits their needs, students will be able to design a project that they have time to do. For example, if a student knows they they will work at their summer job on weekdays during the summer, they will be able to design a project that they can work on over the weekend. Also, students will be able to design a project that involves resources that they have access to. For example, some students do not have resources like WiFi, a computer, or a car. If a teacher assigns a project that requires the internet or transportation, students who do not have that resource will not be able to complete it. In addition, some teacher-designed projects require the student to spend money on materials. If that student's family does not make a lot of money, that student is at a disadvantage because their peers are able to produce better projects than they can. This issue can be resolved with student-designed projects because students will be able to design a project with resources that they have access to. When students can design their own project, they have the ability to design a project that suits their schedule and involves accessible resources.

Though student-designed projects benefit the student, students still need guidance from a teacher. Some students might not design an appropriate project, and others might need help coming up with an idea. Therefore, teachers should serve as a mentor to students while they are designing their projects. One thing that the teacher should do is help students come up with a good plan. If the teacher is not requiring students to plan their projects, some students might design bad projects. In addition, students should be required to get approval from a teacher before starting a project. This forces students to design a good project that covers topics related to their class. It also ensures that students will not design a bad project. Also, teachers will be able to provide resources such as books, materials, and database that the students do not have access to. If the teacher provides good resources to students, it allows the student to design a project that they can do well on.

In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects because it allows them to choose a project that is relevant to their interests and suits their schedule. It also allows them to design a project that involves resources that they have access to. This ability minimizes the advantages some students have over others. However, teachers should still be involved in summer projects by providing resources and giving approval for projects. Overall, if students are able to design their own summer project, they will perform better than if they are assigned a project that their teacher designed.
