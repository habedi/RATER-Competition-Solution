By centering the article around technology that that is able to read students' emotions, Nick D'Alto makes a great case that this developement would be a direct benefit to the learning environment. If this new technology is implemented in schools, educators will see test scores rise and see positive behavioral effects in children because of the use of emotion reading technology.

One of the most important aspects to consider when designing an education experience is whether or not it is beneficial, and more importantly, if it will keep students engaged. Dr Huang theorizes is paragraph 6 that a classroom computer could recognize when a student becomes distracted or confused, and the computer could alter the lesson and make it more useful. This could largely impact the education system by allowing each and every individual student to have a customized lesson plan based on their reactions to the origional one. With this new innovation, schools could become more efficient and churn out more successful students than ever before.

One of the many duties a teacher has is educating the students, but one of the most important roles a teacher can play in a students life is implementing discipline. As described in paragraph 8, this technology has the ability to screen people on whether they are being truthful or deceitful. Just like lying politicians, kids can get away with a lot. If bad habits continue to follow them throughout school, they will end up with a criminal potential later in life. Emotion reading technology could possibly save a students future if the teacher could read if the kid is being truthful or not. If a young child is found to be lying, the teacer could effectively discipline the kid and end the bad habit at an early age. Another example would be if kids are really telling the truth if they understand the lesson or not. If kids are truly confused and won't admit it, the emotion sensing technology would read their faces and the teacher would be alerted that the students don't undestand the lesson. These forms of accountability would instill morals and discipline in children and prevent them from forming bad habits at a young age, and eventually lead to a better and more just society.

Overall, emotion reading technology would be a strong benefit to society and specifically the education system. By being able to understand eachother better, the human population has the ability to evolve and become more intelligent, compassionate, and responsible. If it takes a new technology to bring people a higher understanding of eachother, than that technology should be implemented in not just the education system, but many other institutions around the world.
