There is a huge issue now and days with driving and cellular devices. There has been many reports of texting while driving causing car accidents and many deaths in the past 10 years. People should not be allowed to operate cell phones while driving. Operating a cellular device is a major distraction and does plenty of harm rather than good. These distractions are causing families to lose loved ones and to constantly mourning when these incidents can be avoided.

Texting is one of the main issues when using cell-phones while driving. "According to The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year." (edgarsnyder. com) Not only does cell phone use while driving cause crashes it also cause deaths. In the year of 2017 alone it has been reported that 3,477 people have died from distracted driving. These death tolls have only been increasing and it has to be stopped.

Teen distracted driving is even worse than adults. Teens are very distracted in general when it comes to school, relationships, social media,etc. This means that their minds are already running a mile per minute. This causes them to be in high risk of getting into accidents because their full attention is not on the road. On top of this when teens are texting and driving this completely takes their entire attention away from the road and not only puts their lives at risk but also leaves other drivers, pedestrians, and passengers in their cars at risk.

Driving distractions are not only caused by cell-phones there are other factors to consider.

These factors include cognitive, visual, and manual; Cognitive consists of taking your mind off driving. Visual includes taking your eyes physically off the road. Lastly, manual means to take your hands off the wheel. All of these things are normally done in a back to back sequence.

Which cause accidents to occur and vehicles to also become damaged.

Thankfully there have been laws passed recently that are now prohibiting cell-phone use while operating a motor-vehicle. Even though this law has been put into effect drivers are still using cell-phones. The consequence for not adhering to this law is a 100 dollar fine, a ticket, and a bad note on your license. Due to drivers ignoring this law people are continuing to become injured and worse lose their lives. To prevent these horrific things from occuring providers have made a system while driving on the phones that enables a person from receiving messages while driving. With these provisions we should see a substantial difference in the death and injury toll in our communities.
