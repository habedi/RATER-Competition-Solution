Would you like to lose the ability to choose what you do in your daily life? Well, most people would not enjoy losing their given right to decide, and that applies to students as well. Participating in an extracurricular activity has been a choice for the longest time, and it is unjustifiable to force students to engage in such tiring activities. It wouldn't make anyone enjoy school more, it would actually do the opposite, It would tarnish the awful reputation that most schools have and would justify the claim that schools are nothing but a large road block holding kids back. Thats why I disagree with mandatory extracurricular activities, extracurricular activities should always be a choice, and not forcibly be laid upon an individual, it would ruin the palpable relationship between school and students, and it would dramatically increase stress in a school environment.

Firstly, students would have to endure the retched activities that they don't enjoy, and it would tire these kids out to the point which they collapse on bed whenever they would return home, reducing the amount of time we have to work on projects, homework, and other things alike. This, in theory, would increase stress by a staggering amount. Oh, and have I mentioned that most students struggle to wake up and arrive to school at time? Well, having mandatory extracurricular activities would increase the amount of time an individual takes to sleep, making it even harder for us students to arrive on time. Multiple studies have also shown a connection between grades and sleep. This could mean the school getting lower and lower test scores which would be devastating to everyone involved.

Secondly, it would make students dislike our school more than they do already. it would also massively tarnish the awful reputation of schools and promote the rumor that a school is nothing but a massive nuisance to students. Considering the condition and cleanliness of our gym and field it's no wonder why they're both the center of mockery here. It's not hard to guess that extracurricular activities would also contribute to an increase in homework, as P.E already gives out homework and projects which can take up to weeks to complete. In short having mandatory extracurricular activities would tarnish the schools reputation by a wide margin and increase the amount of work both Teachers and Students do, and promote the false narrative that school is just a large road bump.

Lastly, I wish to reiterate that extracurricular activities are choices, and not privileges. You may think that extracurricular activities would make students more happy and fit, but no sir, it would instead be another factor contributing to the mockery of our school. The education system should always be seen with respect, but extracurricular activity and other unwanted principles of school is turning it into a source where people poke fun at. If mandatory extracurricular activities are retracted, it would promote individuality and open up more choices in an increasingly unique world. What makes school special isn't friends, classes, or teachers, it's the ability to choose, just like how we chose what classes to take, or choose what to eat on lunch, taking whats special to us is simply outrageous and unethical.

In conclusion, the decision to impose mandatory extracurricular activities is a massive mess up on the schools part, and it is an awful part of school that takes away our right to choose and inflicts a large amount of stress and anxiety upon the student. Extracurricular activities would also be used to mock our school and make kids dislike school more and more. I hope you understand now Mr. Principle. Reversing your decision would be the most plausible and well received decisions amongst the student community. Now, I'd like to ask, would you enjoy having your choices taken away? I believe the correct answer for all of us would be, no.
