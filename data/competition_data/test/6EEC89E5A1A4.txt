Dear Principal ,

I think you shouldn't require all students to perform in community service because some students may think differently from other students.

For Example some students like to work in community service but some don't. Some Students think that community service takes time away from there activities. I think that community service is for people that like to participate in there community activities and voluntear on them. Community service is a great thing because it shows us students to care more about other people and our community to make it better. Also community service helps us come all together to make our community a better place for the people that live in our community and that it helps us get along and work tall together to achieve something that we want to make better. I personally think that working in community service helps us a lot because we all come together and help each other to have a better place to live. Some of community services are really fun . For example you can help elementary school student or help the elderly people in the nursing homes because some of there families don't visit them a lot and there their in those nursing homes alone.
