Dear Principal,

I do think that we should have community service hours required for our school. It is the best moral thing that schools teach and It really should be a requirement.

One reason for this is because students would be giving back to their community. They would be doing something to help the community and make it a better place rather than just playing Xbox or just fooling around.

In addition I think that it is a good idea because the students could actually learn lessons from different tasks they complete and if they do something that hurts the community they can see what it feels like to be the people that have to clean up the aftermath. This is more of a moral understanding than anything else of your community, your friends, and your family and how it affects them.

Finally, I think that kids would have an opportunity to get to know what their community is all about in the first place. If your like me and you pretty only socialize with your group of friends and not with really anybody else, it'll give the person a chance to meet really nice people in your community! Usually, people doing community service are really nice people.

So in conclusion, I think that community service should be a requirement to graduate from school. This conclusion was based off of moral feelings toward the subject.

Sincerely,

Students
