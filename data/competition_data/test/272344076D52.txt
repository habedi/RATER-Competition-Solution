To get from point A to point B, whether it be from home to the park or from school to the movies, the logical answer that pops up in everyone's mind seems to be a car. Automibles such as cars and motorcycles are widely used and are integrated into every part of society. But do automobiles really need to be so rooted into everything people do as a society? Cars and motorcycles create a myriad of problems such as congestion and smog. Some societies even legally limit their community's automobile usage to attempt to correct some essential problems. Limiting automobile usage is important, because not only is it practiced globally with tremendous success, but it also largely reduces pollution caused by diesel fuel and brings to light issues within communities and accounts for their resolution.

Automobiles are thought of as a daily commodity in most urban countries, but there are some societies in which usage has been reduced or even eliminated entirely and the positive results may be shocking. In the suburban city Vauban, Germany, residents have given up automobiles for a chance at a life free of traffic sounds and stress. This experimental journey within the town has acheived these and so much more. Their streets are essentially car-free and the lack of garages and parking space allows for up to 5,500 people to live in a single rectangular square mile with any necessary stores within walking distance (Source 1 Par 6). Simlarly-yet on a much smaller scale, Bogota, Columbia has initiated a car-free day in an attempt to eliminate the area's pollution as well as reduce stress. The day is on its third year and has done as hoped. Additionally, Bogota's once pitted and uneven sidewalks have been since replaced and made much smoother, and the city has introduced parks and sports centers, new restaruants, and new shopping centers which are blossoming and thriving (Source 4 Par 28). these changes have created a society both happy and strongly bonded. As wonderful as these positive shifts in society are, limiting autombile usage can do even more.

A limit in automible usage can also benefit communities by reducing pollution-seeing as a large majority of air pollution is created through the release of diesel fuels into the air. Paris, France legally banned personally autombile use throughout the city in order to rid the city's air of harsh pollutants (Source 2 Par 10). France experiences a combination of cold nights and warm days that trap the emmisions from cars, scooters, and motorcycles (Source 2 Par 15).Â  By significantly reducing the amount of diesel fuels rising to the air to be trapped, the smog had cleared enough within mere weeks that the city was able to entirely lifted the ban. This is a major example of the advantages limiting car usage entails.

Altogether, limiting automobile usage is key to improving society and has myriad advantages such as creating a more bonded and pleasant community and reduces environmental hazards like pollution. Creating vehicular limits is a promising way to change the world as we know it for the better.
