I belive that the Facial Action Coding system reading is very accurate and can be used in the classoom might help. Theres many ways that if the teacher is aware she/he can might can help out that student. Theres a saying that states "you cannot read a persons mind" which is true but you can sense there emotions by the look on their face sometimes . The Facial Action Coding can help you read fully what this person is feeling.

For examples The Facail Coding System can tell if you're faking your smile to keep from showing how you really feel teachers wouldnt know how you feel unless you tell them whats going on with you. Using the coding system can tell the teacher your emtions that way they can deal with it and move forward in your learning. Not only just a happy and sad emotion the system can consist but when the teacher is teaching the lesson she can tell if the students get in by the expression on their face the sensor can tell weather or not the student is fustrated or confused on what the he/she is teaching. The teacher can get a percentage of the students emotions about the lesson if teacher gets the results and they show simlar patterns of confusion among the she can revist the lesson . In paragraph 6 it states when the compture predicts how the student is feeling it can "modify the lesson " I believe that it'll help the student learn the lesson like everybody else is in their own way because everybody has different levels of learning

In conclusion I believe that ther Facail dectection can be very helpful in the classroom setting. It can help teachers learn and create lesson for everybody to get a better understanding in what they are teaching. The analaysis can also help everybody to come more aware and understand facial expression.
