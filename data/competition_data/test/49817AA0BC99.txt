Most schools require student to do summer projects of various types, but should they be teacher-designed or student-designed? Some people may agree that summer projects should be student-designed as they believe it would be better for students to make their projects based on anything of the students interest and it would be easier for them to complete the projects, but summer projects should be teacher-designed because the projects will include restrictions that students would have to follow and can help student create their projects based on a topic.

To begin with, summer projects should have restrictions which may be easily given by teachers. If there were not to be any restrictions, then students would have the ability to make their projects about anything they would like. In addition, a student could put anything they would like into their projects, but if a teacher added restrictions, the student will make their projects based on what the teacher required them to do. Restrictions can also help students' summer projects to be neat and organized. For example, students could have no idea what to make their projects about, resulting in having a bunch of nonsense put on their projects, but when students are given restrictions, it can help them think of what the teacher would want to see on their projects and what they would not want to see. To summarize, teachers should have the ability to give restrictions for their students summer projects.

Secondly, if the summer projects student were required to complete were to be student-based, some students could make their project based on a topic that is coeducational; instead, summer projects should be based on what the student has learned in school and should include skills they have been taught. For example, if a history teacher asks students to complete their projects based on a historical event they have learned and are interested in, students will have an educational-based topic and could possibly add skills like critical thinking. This also gives students a subject to make their projects based on and gives students options. In addition, if a student needs to complete a project for their science teacher, they would be required to make their project science-related. To summarize, teacher-designed projects will help students make it educational-based and give student options.

In conclusion, summer projects required by some schools should be teacher-designed. I agree with this because teacher-designed projects can come with restrictions that will help students have an idea and be organized when completing their projects and teacher-designed projects will require students and give them a subject to make their projects on and give them options that are based on what they have learned.Â
