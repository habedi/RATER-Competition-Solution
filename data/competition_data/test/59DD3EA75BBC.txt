"Venus, somtimes called the 'Evening Star,' is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot." Venus is one of the planets close to earth. Venus is a plant that most often has the same weather as the Earth. The geology and weather present like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning that strikes on the surface. The author of this passage, "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is a good place to study. Many astronomers were fascinated by Venus of how it may once have been the most Earth-like in our planet solar system. In the passage the author states that "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could of had formed any various forms of life." Also at this time Venus still has some features of earth. Some of the features Venus has is that the surface are rocky sediment, they also include valleys, mountains,and craters.

Another point for how Venus is a good planet to discover. Some impressive things that could happen on Venus are "exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. by comparison, systemsthat use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat,and other forces." Also "modern computers are powerful, flexable, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."

At the end Venus is our sister planet. NASA has been working and planning other ways to aproach Venus. Most of their electronics had been tested and had lasted for at least three weeks. As the author has stated in the beginning that studying Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Worth the dangers that could happen at Venus there are other impressing things to find and discover.
