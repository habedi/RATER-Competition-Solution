Using technology to read students' emotional expressions is a very bright idea. Using this type of technology in the classrooms could get out of hand, but I believe it would extremely useful. All it takes is a little time to get use to then it would be a huge help. When working on assignments during class on the computers, or being assigned a video, the computer would be able to read our emotions and try to put a twist into the lesson, and not just any twist, it would help the students catch onto the lesson and learn from the activity. I believe that the Facial Act Coding System would be a great help, especially for teachers use.

When learning something new in class it can be a bit boring. Especially when reading articles on the computer or even watching videos. Students fall asleep or even get on their phones. Even if the teacher hands out guides during the videos, no one can catch on and keep their minds on the video. Teachers try to find the videos that give good lessons, but are also attention grabbers. In the article Dr. Huang predicts, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."

I believe that this technology would be extremely valuable and could possibly even bring students grades up. Even if it was just a little assignment here and there, the computer could recognize the boredem and help with the lesson. I feel as if students would concentrate more often and actually be doing good in class if the FACS would be set up on school computers.

Teachers I believe would want look into this technology, it could even help the kids remember more and do better on test. Test are always a big chunk of your grade and not everyone does their best, but with this technology it can help students remember information and actually keep the information well known in their minds.
