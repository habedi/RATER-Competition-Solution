Dear principal,

Community service is a great thing to do to help the earth. Some students feel that community service isn't right for them to do and it takes up their leisure time. It would be great to get things done. For example, cleaning up trash can stop pollution and make earth look more organized. Instead of laying around and doing nothing or going out with a couple of friends, you can always pick another day to do that. Once the trash man comes, that trash being picked up is eventually going to get polluted. It would be best to get it and recycle rather than having the worst done to it. In the end, you will be appreciated and it will benefit you in your future.

Tutoring younger children can be benefiting as well. When children grow up to be smart, they might be the ones who make the world better. Having extra help when they needed, showed that someone cared for their future and that can build confidence in what they really want to do in life.. I feel that if we do it now, things will change for the better. Some of us may not see it now but they will in the future. I believe that thinking ahead makes you plans go smoother. I plan for the earth to be clean. I'm sure everyone wants the earth to be clean as well. Maybe when they picture things now in the future, they will be proud of what they have done.
