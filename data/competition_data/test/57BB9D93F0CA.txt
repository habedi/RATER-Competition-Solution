Should Summer projects be teacher or student-designed?

Summer projects are a big thing for most schools.

It gives the students to do something over the long break and make sure their brain is still doing school work and thinking.

Some summer projects are packets that teach you what you will be learning in your next math class or an entire book you will need to read for english or even a 2 page essay for your history class.

No student wants to do these projects because they aren't fun, and they are supposed to be on a break from school, they shoudn't have to be doing homework that they don't want to do.

Summer projects should be student-desgined.

If they get to pick what they get to do research on and get to show it in their own creative way I am sure they will want to do it way more, than if it was a teacher-designed project where they would have to do it a specific way.

If you are on break you should be having fun, so shouldn't a Summer project be fun too?

There are so many different ways you can make a project fun, in the students interest and use the students creativity.

They can make a slideshow on google like most students do now, if they are an artist they can make a cartoon, if they like directing they can make a short movie, if they are writers they can make a mini book, if they like planning they can make a brochure, and if they like being creative they can make a poster.

There are endless options on what a student can make for their project.

If they are have other creative school appropritate ideas they can ask their teacher if they can do that instead.

Think about it, if you get a boring old project that no one wants to do then most likely they will throw it together last minute or won't do it at all;

especially if they don't do their school work anyways.

It is like forcing an artist to write or vise versa.

Doing their project in their own way, they like will make it so much more fun and interesting.

They can do it any way that is school appropriate and show their talents and interests while making it.

Like an inspring director can make a mini movie, or an artist can make a cartoon.

There are so many different ideas out there it would make the project much more fun.

People think if it is teacher-designed it will be neat.

I disagree, if they are forced to do their project a certain way they will make it sloppy, and not put a lot of effort in because they would be forced to do something they might not be good at.

Projects can be a pain, and be super hard or a lot of work sometimes.

Students will want to do the long, a lot of work project if they can make it their own.

If they are forced to do it a certain way they won't want to do it, and it won't get done.

"What if it is a grade and they have to do it?"

Some might say, well they can still throw it together and could possibly get a good grade on it, or the student might not care about their grade and might not do it.

Student love showing their creativity, it can show some of their cool talents.

If they can make their project their own and do it any way they want to, they would do it for fun.

Many students love doing projects their own way because they can show their creativity and cool talents.

Someone can do their project even as a song if they love singing, and their friend can make it into a music video if they like editing and directing.

They are so many fun and endless ways to make a Summer project if it was student-desgined.

Summer projects can be a lot, but if they were student-designed so many students would love to do their project.

They would be able to do it any way they want to and use their minds to make something amazing with their own creativity.

There are so many options like making a movie, making a slideshow, making a mini book, making a cartoon, making a poster, making a song, making a brochure.

There are so many more, I am sure students can make their hobby into a project and pull something together that would be so fun to make.

Summer projects should be fun since they are during the Summer break.

You are supposed to be having fun, and having a break from school.

This is why I think Summer projects should be student-designed instead of being teacher-desgined.
