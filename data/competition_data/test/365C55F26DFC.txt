Dear Principal,

I believe that changing the policy rules to having a B average is not a very good choice because most of the students in this school have a C average. If you change the rules then we wouldn't have anyone in the sports or any activities the school has to offer. These students with a C average will not be physically active if you change the school policy. I believe that they won't be able to wake up in the morning because they won't have anything to look forward to in the day. I think that they should be able to join any sport or activity they want.

If students with a C participate in joining the sport or activity they want and if they do really well on it, they might have a chance in getting a scholarship for college. They could be able to get into a good college if they participate. I think you shouldn't change the rules into only the students with an average of a B will be able to join. I also think that it will help them aim for a higher grade if they get a scholarship.

Furthermore, I also think that you should change the policy because it could help them stay physically active and fit. They will also get a chance to stay fit if they like the sport and if they also like the activity that they are doing. The students with a C need it to stay active in a sport. It will keep them very healthy and strong. I am against the policy because of those reasons.

I also believe that changing the school policy is a bad idea because we might lack students that can participate in the activities and sports. In this school we have more students with an average of a C so i think that it wouldn't help the school if you change the policy. Our school might not have enough students in a basketball or soccer team to compete with other schools. I believe that our school will be good if you don't change the school policy.

Sincerely, student
