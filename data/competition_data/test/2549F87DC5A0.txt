I personally think he is correct. Although i agree with his statement, not all children have to participate in an extracurricular activity, they should be allowed to choose which activities they do, if they wish to do any. I also think they should just enjoy their own hobbies, for example, music is a hobby of mine.

Alright, so let me explain this to you, some kids have special needs and arent able to do such activities. While others already have so much going on in their life and might get sidetracked from choosing an activity. While i understand some just dont want to do the activities, they should not be forced to. I understand that some people love these kinds of activities, however, some cannot do them. I mainly agree because

"exircise, is a mental health reliever".

Some kids have certain physical problems,so they should at least be allowed to choose less physically active activities, for example, chess. Chess is a game more for the excirsise of the mind, than the body. Coding is another good one for kids who cant do physical activities. It improves their sense of direction,and quick thinking, at least, that is how i feel about it. Quite frankly,

I understand what this principal is trying to get across , however, he or she may be going about it all wrong.

I personally think the activites that he or she has requested people do, is reasonable. For example, the yearbook club, a nice, peacful club that doesnt require too much physical skill.

I think these kids should be required to do less of the activities, mainly because they have their own hobbies, why shouldnt they get to continue doing them as often as they normally would? I say this mainly because it just makes sense. You know? In a matter of, "i like to do this over this". and etc. I personally have a musical hobby. I play guitar, sing, and play a few other instruments that i know alot of young people play. Some people give up on hobbies because they are "too hard" or certain quotes like "it's just not my thing", i think everyone should always keep trying at their hobbies, even if they are already good at them, or are very bad at them.

I have stated my opinon, now listen reader, i will include bonus information about musical, and genral hobbies, if you don't mind.

There are alot of hobbies for you to try that are out in the world, some even count as legitimate jobs. I'll give you some examples. Being a guitarist is an exciting thing to do, mainly because other people love to hear it, and once you get the hang of it, it's just so easy to do. Another good hobby is being a singer. While you think it is probably easy to sing, it is actually quite difficult, especially if you are trying to hold a note. It's nowhere near as easy as it looks.

Alright so back to my opinion on the activities, i will now conclude for you, that everyone shouldn't have to do the activities, but overall i get the principals standpoint, so i agree with him/her. However, that does not mean you should go around quoting me, mainly because you should use the words for your own benifit, so with that said, that is my opinion, have a nice day!
