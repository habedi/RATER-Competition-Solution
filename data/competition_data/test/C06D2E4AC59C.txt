Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. My opinion about if drivers should use a phone while driving, my answer will be no because your risking a lot of things.

Do you want to risk your life for your phone? The reason why I will say no is because you are risking your life and someone else's life. You can easily run off the road into a ditch, off a bridge, into a building, etc. You could be behind bars because you glanced at your phone to respond to a text, that simple. Many don't realize how dangerous it is to text and drive or even change your music.

What if it's an emergency? Some will argue about this, but if it's truly an emergency you can always pull over somewhere and fix the problem. Because you don't want to be driving and someone calls or texts you and tells you" your house is on fire".

You want to be able to think about the next step instead of trying to drive and text/call.

Your already worried and scared that you might not have somewhere to stay the next day.

What if i'm using GPS?

You can always bluetooth your phone to your radio. Or even go to walmart and buy one of the phone holders to set up in your car. There is always a way to use your phone safely.

Some cars already have gps so you don't need to touch your phone at all.
