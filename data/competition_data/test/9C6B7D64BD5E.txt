NASA noticed something unfimiliar on the Red Planet called Cydonia. Many people thought it was an old ancient civilization. There were many conspiracy theroies. Is there an actual head on Mars?

Some people may disagree, but the face is just a rock formation. There has been no discovery of aliens yet to think this had something to do with aliens. Phototgraphs show that its a rock formation.

In 1998 NASA took photograpghs of the "face" while orbiting Mars. They then posted the pictures online. When the image appeared on the website, the photo revealed a natural landform. There was no ancient civilization monument.

So, Is there an actual head on Mars? No, it is just a rock formation, and when light hits it, it produces shadows that look like eyes, mouth, and nose. Many people were upset because it wasnt an alien monument. NASA will always keep a close eye on "the Face on Mars".
