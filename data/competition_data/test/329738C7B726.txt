The author claims that exploring Venus despite the dangers is a worthy pursuit. Which it may or may not be. They tell us about the dangers in pressure and heat on the surface of Venus and how it may stop us from getting to there physically. The author also explains how we could explore our sister-planet, Venus in a couple ways and tries to put it into perspective for us.

The author starts with talking about previous missions to reach Venus that ended unsuccessful due to Its harsh surface and atmosphere. The atmosphere of Venus is almost 97% carbon dioxide and to add onto that the clouds carry highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Making it difficult already to get a human or anything really through just the atmosphere living. The surface of Venus can average over 800 degrees farenheit along with the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than our own. These conditions are far too much for a human to make it to the surface of Venus which can set back this exploration of Venus.

Moving on further the author states "If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?" He/She answers this question with the thought that long ago Venus may have been just like the earth we live on now. Covered in stable land and oceans, supporting many lifeforms, and maybe vegetation. Reason for thinking this is even today Venus has some features that are similiar to Earth. The rocky sediment surface, valleys, mountains, craters all show similiarity between Venus and earth. The author seems to want a return to Venus because we may be able to find more clues for this thought.

The author sees a return to Venus as indisputable, but questions, "What are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive." They answer this question by proposing an idea by NASA to send humans to Venus. This idea would be a possible solution to avoid the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus. A blimp-like vehicle that hovers over the surface of Venus keeping them from the harsh conditions. An idea like this may work but it still seems like it would still be almost too hot for a person to be safe in. Even 30 miles above the surface of mars the temperature is still about 170 degrees farenheit. Looking down at the surface of Venus from a hovering ship may not be worth it all because you are limited on sight due to the lack of light able to penetrate the atmosphere. I do not think this idea would be worth the time and effort it would take to get there.

In conclusion the author states a few good suggestions that could get us to Venus for exploration but there are also many ways that make this impossible to get a person there. The atmoshpere and surface of Venus just seem too harsh to get an manned aircraft there safely. Not only that I think that even if we did safely get a manned spacecraft to hover the surface of Venus, it would come out as not worth it over all to the lack of exploration that would be completed. I think that we should pursuit studying Venus through unmanned spacecraft simply because it would be too difficult with our technology now to get a person there and back safely.
