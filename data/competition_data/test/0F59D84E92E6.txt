It's a once in a lifetime oppurtunity like I knew for people to help others and explore around the world. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to take care on not just animals, but also people in need. As I said "Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China," I said. Also in Venice,Italy it was "A city with streets of water." As you travel to theese far away places you also haft to take care of animals along the way.

Caring for theese animals willl sure keep you busy, but it is quite easy all you do is feed them, water them, and clean stalls. This experience is also good with connecting with people on the ship. I had fun on board with games such as baseball,volleyball,tabel-tennis,fenncing,boxing,reading,and other games past the time. With this journey it made me aware of people of countries and there needs. So join not only the Seagoing Cowboys for helping people, but also the exsperience.

Even though on the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see cities and have fun, but it is also a tremendus amount of work. As you said taking animals is actually hard dependig on what animal. You need to clean,feed,and give water to animals every single day. Sure you have breaks but it is still a lot of work for one person. Not to metion this exsperince is on a boat. Most people either have sea sickness on boats as well you have a extreme chance of crashing,sinking,drowning,and also falling off board into endless ocean.

While travilling all over the word you haft to deal with climate and time change. It will take some getting use to constantly changing weather and sleep schedules. Also its very hard to even sleep on a boat with sailing on dangerous waters in the dark every night. While caring for people is a great deed to do it is aslo hard watching people suffer everyday even though your helping them you can still think of other people in that situation as well.
