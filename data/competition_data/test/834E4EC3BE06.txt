Do you thimnlk we should have a limit of usage for our cars? i think we should! my three main reasons why are because , so we dont /waste alot of fossi fuels,wont make lots of polution and so we can save money and tust me evryone loves to save money!!!!!

My first reason why we should have a limit to using our cars are because so we dont waste alot of our fossil fuerol. we go through tons and tons of fossil fuel. It's getting to the point were we might even  run out of it and wont have it anymore and wont be able to make gas and trust me we use gas for just about everything!

My second reason why we should limit the usage of our cars is so  we dont produce alot of polution. we produce tons and tons of polution every single time we drive our cars and thats very bad cause it polutes our air and it not good for us to breath it in!

My last reason why we should limit the usage of our cars is cause it will vsave us tons of money! i mean keep count everyday how much you pay for gas and at the end of the week add thewm all together and see how much you waste on gas each weeek. also what if your tiers are no good nomore just for a set of 4 its going to bcome up to like $200 dolars !And then what is you need new light or new windshield wipers. ust think how much money you put in to your car. if i were you i would just start walking or rideing a bike!

Just a few moments ao i eexplained to you my top 3 reasons why we should limit the usage of our cars because,we wont waste a tonb of fossil fuel,wont produce lots of polutio and it will save us tons of money!
