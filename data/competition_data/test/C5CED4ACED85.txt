Students should be able to bring phones to school and use them when not in class. If students were able to do this then they wont have the urge to do so while in class. They should be able to use them during Breakfast, and Lunch. They will still have to keep them on vibrate so they don't distract anybody or anyone. If they are caught texting in class then they will lose their phone privileges for the remainder of the day. If the students aren't allowed to use phones at school then they will try to act cool and do it any way and get in trouble. If they text in class then they wont know what to do on their homework or they wont care what the teacher says. using phones at school is a good thing because, 1:Kids wont do anything bad because they will be focused more on their phones, 2: It will cut down the schools phone bill. If students are caught texting in class they will have to read it out loud in front of the whole class. If a student forgot his homework or project at home, he can call or text his parent or guardian asking them to bring it to school without having to go to the office and calling from their. This will keep kids from fighting and from doing other bad things. This is why I think you should pick this policy.
