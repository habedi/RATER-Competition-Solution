Did you ever have a favorite sport as a child? Did you have a bunch of baseballs or soccer balls in your room? Did you ever run up to your parents asking for nothing but to play a game or basketball with you? Imagine you failed a math a test because you didn't understand the concept and your grade suddenly went down from a perfect A right down to a C. Try outs for the soccer team are next week and you really want to go. You've been waiting for it for the whole year, but then you realize you can't because of your grades.

Changing the grade requirement for sports from a B to a C is a big consideration. People with D' s or F' s obviously haven't earned the privileged to be eligible for sports, but what about people will C' s? The average letter grade for students are C' s. I think changing the average for grades to B is going to be a hard change for students.

A compromise that maybe can be done is looking at the students other grades. If a student has just one C and all A' s or B' s the rest, he is eligible for the team. If a student has all C' s, then he is probably not a very good candidate for someone who tries hard to keep up their grades.

I argue that students with C' s should be accepted on to the sports team because not everyone can get perfect grades all the time. Everyone has their moments when they didn't get the topic or were having a bad day on a test day.

What should be considered when trying out for a sports team is the effort of a student, their ability to try, and their skills. Of course it's important that students are doing well in school and that they can juggle both sports and schoolwork. For some people it's hard to maintain both at the same time and you can't always tell that from someone's grades. Students that have A' s could slip down to a D' s just by not doing their homework because they had a game that day. In that case, the students is not able to handle both school and sports.

I imagine that if the grade average was pushed up to a B to be on a sports team, students would try as hard as they could to get their grade up, but who says they haven't been trying already? What if a D student tried so hard to be on the school team, but could only raise it up to a C?

These are all some of my reasons on why I think that the school policy shouldn't be changed. Grades are can be very hard to maintain for students sometimes and a C is a good letter grade to decide if you can be on the sports team or not.
