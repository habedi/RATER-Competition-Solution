This is why I think the principle should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time because students should be able to have cell phones in school as long as they don't use it in the middle of learning things. Also as long as the ringer is off so that the student does not disturb anyone.

student should be allowed to have their phones in school because teachers hate when the students are loud when their not supposed to be talking, but with cell phones they would be occupied for a longer period of time. Also because most students who have phones already use them during school anyways so I think it would be much easier for you to just let us use them. Teachers hate having to take phones from the students when they have them out and some students may need with them at all times for personal reason. Maybe even for medical reasons. So that's why I think that we should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.
