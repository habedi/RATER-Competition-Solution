The school's policy on grade averages for students participating in sports should be at least a "B" average.

This policy makes total sense and I can see why the policy should be changed from a "C" average to a "B" average.

I have a few ideas that I would like to present to you, in order for you to understand my viewpoints and fully understand this concept.

The first idea that will help you to understand this concept is that it is often very hard for people to make it into professional teams or leagues in order for them to make a living off of sports.

Many students believe that they are the next big sports star, when in all reality the possibility and the chances of them becoming the next big person in the business of sports, is a very slim one.

While these students are in this mind-set of being this wonderful person in the sports business, they often forget about their grades.

When students are totally focused on sports, they drop the whole grades idea and focus on a career in sports.

Many of them truly believe in the idea that they will go into the professional leagues, and do not stop to focus on pursuing other careers.

The second idea that I would like to present to you, is the concept of the principles and concepts that having good grades teach you.

One of the practical lessons that having the dedication to get good grades teaches you is the concept of hard work.

We all know that in order to survive and thrive happily in the real world, you have to work hard and be dedicated.

If the students are not even dedicated to work hard enough to get good grades, then what coach would want them?

I don't think that a lot of the coaches would want a lazy person that doesn't have what it takes to work hard and get things done.

I know that sports are fun, but seriously, if you can't keep up the good grades, then you need to try something else.

Having a career in sports isn't like a golden ticket to happiness, you have to be dedicated and work hard.

If you can't stay dedicated enough to get good grades, then I don't think that you have what it takes to make it into the professional league.

The third idea that I have for you, is the fact that there are so many ways to live your life.

I briefly touched on the idea of other careers in the first paragraph, but I would like to explore this concept more fully now.

We all know that in order to get into a high paying career, you generally have to get good grades.

Without good grades, there are many colleges and occupations that will not except you.

If you can't get into the college that you want, or get into the occupation that you want, then you probably won't be as happy as you possibly could be.

Of course, money and a career can help you to do many things and help you to get through life happily.

Money and happiness are also important for finding a spouse, nobody would want to marry someone who can't get a career.

Eventually, everyone will want to get married and live their happily ever after.

Unfortunately, when you can't get a career and support a family, not very many people will be interested in you.

Happily ever afters don't just magically appear. You have to work for them, you have to stay dedicated and work hard until the end.

I think that getting good grades is a wonderful foundation and a wonderful start to your happily ever after.

Now that I have touched on a few of the bases about getting good grades in order to participate in sports, let me just remind you of the basic ideas that I have gone over.

First of all, while you may believe that you will make it into the professional leagues, the chances are very slim.

Second, getting good grades helps to teach you the practical lessons of working hard and staying dedicated.

Third, there are so many careers out there that require you to have a good education.

Lastly, not very many people would want to spend the rest of their life with someone who can't even support a family.

I hope that this paper has helped to shed some light on the subject of sports and good grades.

Students should be able to keep a "B" average while still participating in sports.
