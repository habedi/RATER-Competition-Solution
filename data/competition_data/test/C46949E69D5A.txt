The principal has proposed the idea that all students should participate in 1 or more extra-curricular activity. Participating in 1 or more extra curricular helps students manage time, try new things, and pursue future careers. This would help students as they get older and help build good habits.

Extra-curricular activities help students manage time. On top of homework, the students now have other things to focus and concentrate on. Students now have practice, private lessons, training, or research to do because of their new activity. This will help students to use their time more wisely and to have priorities. Time management is a good useful skill that many adults struggle with, so learning it in school would be a huge benefit to the student.

The new plan will also help inspire students to try new things. There are many kinds of extra-curricular and students would try things they have never done before. The students might find a new hobby or something they want to pursue professionally. The plan will force students out of their comfort zone and will help students to try different things. For these reasons, students joining activities will try new things and can be used as a skill in the future.

Extra-curricular activities help students pursue dreams and possible careers. Students have hobbies and decide if they like it to the point that they want to pursue it further. Extra-curricular are the way that they can pursue their hobbies. Extra-curricular are easy ways for students to use skills, whether its sports, science, math, engineering, or art. As they use these skills, they hone their talent so that they can use it in the future. Students can try anything and the new plan was a nudge for students to do just that.

The new extra-curricular program will help students manage time, try new things, and pursue dreams and goals. The new program will help create new habits as well as letting students explore what they enjoy. This new plan focuses on students using their time wisely and productively and that is why the principals decision is the right one.
