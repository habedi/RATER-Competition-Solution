Dear Mr./Ms. Senator,

I think it would be a good idea to change the election by popular vote for election of our president. It would be a good idea for a few reasons. One it doesn't fully represent the people, (or general population.) For example, Persident Obama in the 2012 election only recieved 51.3% of the population vote. However because of the Electoral College, he was able to become the president of the United States. And us, the voters, well we aren't even voting for our president. According to source two,

The Indefensible Electoral College , " Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." So us the people aren't even voting, do our votes really even count? Say i live in a state like Maine, then i only have 4 electoral votes, oppose to a big state like Texas, who according to the map in the third source have "38 electoral votes". My vote really doesnt even count. Because of the amount of votes your state gets in the upcoming election relys on the population. But every state only gets one final vote. so say Wyomming gets just as many votes as Texas, who represents 35 million voters. Do you see how this is unfair? And then theres the "Disaster Factor", This can destroy anyones chances at becoming president. It happened in the 60's it happened in the 2000 election, it can happen anytime. The Disaster factor is when repressentatives vote for whom ever they please. When this happened in the 60's rasists almost succeded in a plan to bump President Kennedy from the office. they were going to replace all the electors with different people to go up against Kennedy. The electors can bassically do what ever they please, considering we voted them in. They casn defy us as much as they please. In the 1968 election, just a mere 8 years after the would be catastropy of the segragationists, a tie, yes a tie, almost occured. It was about 10,000 votes away form a "deadlock tie". According to the second source, " During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all." They basically told the swing voters to take it off their hands and vote for who they pleased. These are just a few of the reasons why The Electoral College is Outdated and needs the be repalced.
