Distance learning

Some schools offer distance learning as an option students to attend classes from home by away of online of video conferencing; some students take this way to learn, but the purpose to learn is get it very well. That mean this is better when you go to school with people that is already qualified to teach the stuffs you need to learn in your process, and basically, they are there for everything you need to ask them. But what happen when you take the way to learn away? there are a couple things to talk.

First, you always need to ask questions, and I think this is the most important obstacle,for example: you do not have someone to ask immediately, that is a big benefit to be in class, some people need more than one time to understand a topic or an exercise. May be in a test you need an explication for a question that you do not understand and there is a big problem. This may work when you live far away from a civilization, or you are sick with something strong and is not easy move you body. If you have to work, that is another valid reason to take some classes in your computer because you need time to make money to pay your bills.

Second,you can cheat on the quizzes or even in the big tests that the school assigned to you. If must students cheat being in the school with someone supervising, you can do it at your home too; may be take some notes out, or search in Google some answers, or call a friend with the phone, even ask to your mom or your dad in your home. That mean you are not learning and you never going to learn if you are cheating. After this, you just getting a good grade bad nothing of knowledge and that is why we need some extra help, a person who answer our questions.

Third, the work assigned to the students from the school is not too easy, those are a couple pages and some exercises to do for just one class, so you have to read and understand all by yourself and answer the questions, send that to your teacher and wait until the next document with the exact same dynamic, and that is how you are ÃÂ¨ learning ÃÂ¨, reading papers, and answer questions. Must of the students does not pass the class, the arguments from them are that no one explain very well the way that they have to do the work and when the test comes they do not know nothing. As I said, you still can ask the teacher or look for help in internet, but is not the same thing.

Finally, most of the students has to take the class again, losing all their time that they been doing putting in that class. After all that process, they understand the important to be with someone helping you and not be away from the school. A lot of teachers say that is not a good choice take distance learning, they say is hard and be alone is more difficult, but as I said, I think is good for the people who really cant assist to school.
