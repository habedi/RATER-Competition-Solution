Students are lonely, lazy, and are in trouble more these days. With these things at hand depression and suicide percents are flying up. What can we do about that, extracurricular activities. Our principal has recently decided that we have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree that students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity because they can make new friends, be more productive, and it will keep children out of trouble.

Extracurricular activities will make adolescents new friends. Doing and extracurricular activity will expose kids to other children their age, this will expose them to new friends and new relationships causing bonding and friendship. Whenever I am exposed to new people i have fun with them and we share are similarities and a friendship is usually born. When children have friends they tend to be happier whether its one or many, and it cant hurt to have more friends. I think when children are around their peers they are happier and work harder.

When children engage in extracurricular activities they are more productive. They will have fun doing these activities but they will benefit too. Children can and will work harder after being exposed to extracurricular activities, it will exercise their brain more making them work harder and more efficiently. This will improve test and quiz scores because of the increased work ethic.

Participating in extracurricular activities will keep students out of trouble. Being in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of time away, when you do a sport you have to go to practices after school and games on weekends. Sports take away ten plus hours a week away from your normal routine. Ten hours is a lot of time to get away from bad influences and bad situations. You are less likely to get in bad situations if you are away from them, and doing an extracurricular activity is a perfect way to get away.

Participating in extracurricular activities is a good thing becauseÂ kids can make new friends, they can be more productive, and it will keep children out of trouble. Dont let depression and suicide take Americas children, have students participate in extracurricular activities instead.
