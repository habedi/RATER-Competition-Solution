Technology today is crazy. It keeps expanding and getting bigger, better, and faster. Recenltly scientist have made a computer that has the power and technology to read emotions in students and in other people. I feel like this shouldnt be used in a classroom.

I feel that a computer shouldnt be able to tell wether or not a human being is sad or mad, it shouldnt be able to tell our emotions. Our emotions is for us to handle. Yes, us humans can tell when people we know are sad or down, but computers should not. People would use the computer for somthing else, like to see others emotions. Peoples emotions should keep to their self. It isnt for a computer or other humans to now, because its your emotion.

Yes, this could be valuable for some things, like movies, and video games. THis is not something we could use everyday in a classroom. We could use the computer to see whats wrong with a student. Once we figure out whats wrong with the student, for instance lets say the child is sad. The child is so sad, he cant work or do anything, and us humans cant notice it because he is hiding it. We could use the computer to see what emotions he is having. Once we figure that out we could help him, by doing somthing that makes him happy.

This computer couldnt be valuable in a classroom. If a teacher assigned their students to make a project over the expressions of a human.

Then the coputer would take forever to load. Each human expresses their emotions in a different way. One could be hiding it better than the other. Therefor the computer could get the students emotions wrong, and the students could fail.
