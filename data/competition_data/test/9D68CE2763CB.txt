I do not agree with everyone being forced to participate in an activity. Many students have personal issues going on at home, they might not be athletically inclined or creative, or they have a mental illness or a personality that makes it hard to communicate and participate. There are many more reasons.

Some students might have personal issues going on at home. Kids can have parents that are getting a divorce. Some kid can go through a loved one passing away. They can have experienced a parent getting arrested. Some of them face many more difficulties.

Some students might not be athletically inclined or creative. Kids may dislike sport activities due to many reasons. Students might only watching the activities instead of doing them. They might also dislike the activities because they have to do them physically. These reasons can make a student not have courage to pick an activity.

Some kids have mental illnesses or personalities that make it difficult for them to communicate and participate. Many kids struggle with autism and become shy towards their peers and guardians. Some other kids can be antisocial or they might dislike having friends and be a loner. These kids shouldn't be pressured into something that will make them be uncomfortable. Everyone has a comfort zone and that should be respected by all.

I do not agree with students being forced to participate in an activity. I don't agree because students might have personal issues at home, might not be athletically inclined or creative, or they might have a mental illness or personality that makes it hard for them to communicate and participate. There are many more reasons that make this a terrible idea.
