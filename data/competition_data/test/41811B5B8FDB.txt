Growing up in today's society, it is known that public schooling is the main source of education. Children are introduced to pre-school at a young age to gradually familiarize them with their surroundings and the outside world. Although it is not an issue being talked about, some kids are not given that opportunity to attend school at a certain age, or they are not given the opportunity to attend school at all. There are solutions to that conflict, such as introducing them to kindergarten or first grade instead of starting with pre-school and day care, or having an at-home teacher for home schooling. In most cases, especially in high school, teens are given the option to take online classes that benefit them as much as attending class in school would.

Enrolling in an online class or completely committing to online school is not that different from waking up at 6 a. m. every morning and catching a bus. Being able to take a class online offers one the chance to choose what classes to take and when they want to attend them. For example, Generic_School offers mainly sophomores the oppportunity to take health and physical education over the summer, instead of taking it during the following school year. That way, any sophomore who chooses to take that class over the summer would be able to choose another subject that is in their field of interest or even a class that is beneficial to their future career. The downside of that could be often be a fee, of course, considering that it is a class taking place over the summer while everyone else is enjoying their time with friends and family; however, not all online classes would have to be paid for.

At Generic_School, not only do students have the ability to take classes online over the summer, but students are able to attend classes online during the school year as well. A well-known community college in Generic_City is the Generic_School, which offers online classes to seniors who plan on taking dual enrollment, advanced placement, or even honors. Dual enrollment and advanced placement is important because it gives the student college credit for their classes in college. It is common for upperclassmen to take on that given opportunity and enroll in a class online during the school year, which not only gives them the choice to choose what class they want to attend, but when they want to attend it. For a morning person, one would prefer their class to take place at sunrise, and if one is a night-owl, they would then prefer to take their classes during the evening. In conclusion, it gives students more freedom to expand their interests.

It is understandable that online classes and or schooling can be hard on students, especially if it starts at a young age. Most families would prefer their kid(s) to take on the world with public schooling, but others would rather keep them sheltered if they believe home schooling is a better form of introducing education; nevertheless, it is still education at the end of the day. Any form of education is helpful to society, whether it be online, in school, with a tutor, or family members. Everyone is constantly learning new things everyday, and technology is advancing as the seconds go by. It is all based on preference and what is comfortable with an individual if they want to be a part of an online class or not.

Online schooling and classes can be beneficial because not only does it give students a chance to balance better time management, but it could improve better education purposes with college credits, meeting new people, form new friendships from different schools, and is an overall wonderful experience.
