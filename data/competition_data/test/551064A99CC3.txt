Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars.

NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.

They call it "The Face."

The Face is very interesting.

Many people could have different opinions about how the Face could have gotten on Mars or how it was made.

Your opinion could be that either aliens created the Face or it is just a natural landform, but you would need to have reasons to back up why you believe so.

Aliens have been believed to be real, but others do not think so.

There is no real proof yet, but many scientists and other people are still trying to find clues and details about aliens on other planets.

This leads some to believe that if aliens are real, that they could have created the Face.

How could aliens create something as complex and interesting as the Face?

Aliens could not be that smart.

To think about it being a natural landform, it is pretty complex, but it may just be the way that we are looking at it and are seeing it.

The way we see the Face all depends on the way you are looking at it.

Scientists have named it "The Face" because that is what it looks like, but maybe if someone else looks at it, they would not even see "The Face" at all.

They may see something completely different.

If you think that aliens created "The Face" first see if there is anything else that aliens may have been thought to create or where they came from.

If there is no proof to aliens, then how could they have created something?

And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West.

It almost reminds scientists of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

If these are actually landforms that are naturally formed on Earth, then "The Face" is certainly a natural landform itself.
