Summer break is a time of joy for adults and students alike. However, for students their brains still need to be stimulated so that when they go back to their everyday school-lives they do not forget what they have learned. The means of producing that knowledge for students however, can either be from teachers or from their student peers. Although students should be assigned teacher-designed projects because their assignments are guaranteed to be curriculum based, summer projects should be student-designed because students are able to enjoy themselves over break, they are given the chance to be creative in their learning, and will not be stressed over the summer.

To begin with, students are able to design projects that will bring enjoyment to their fellow classmates. Pupils have common interest to one another, so they would be able to create a project that would be equally enjoyable to their classmates. As a result, this enjoyment will make students more willing to participate in their summer assignment because when someone enjoys doing something they are more apt to do it no matter the amount of time or work that goes into it. Furthermore, if an assignment were to be given over the break, that assignment should be something students enjoy doing. The reason being because summer is the season of enjoyable recreation and by allowing students, who are equally eager to have fun over the break, design said project they are able to stay true to point of summer.

In continuation, student-designed projects give students the ability to add creativity to their learning. On a regular school day teachers are the ones who decide how students will lean. Sometimes what the teacher chooses is only beneficial to a handful of students, and the others have to make due with what they have. By giving the students a chance to make a summer project, they can come up with a learning process that is geared towards their peers. Students feel more comfortable expressing the way they feel they learn best with their classmates, so by giving the creative liberty to students the product created will be something that benefits everyone.

Furthermore, with students designing their own summer projects they will not be stressed over the break. Students are aware of each others needs and their own personal needs, so as a result, they will create an assignment that will not overwork their classmates or themselves. The reason being whatever project is created by the students will most likely have to be completed by the creators too, so if they assign something that will take the majority of the summer to complete or cause a decrease in their mental health, they will have to participate in this assignment as well. However, if a teacher made the summer project they would not have to pay the same price. Which is why a project made by teachers will not be as mindful to the students need to de-stress and prepare for the upcoming school year as a student-designed project would.

Finally, students should design their summer project because they are able to create something everyone will love, they get the chance to think creatively, and they reduce the stress that comes with a summer assignment. If students are given the chance design the summer project the students will come back to school having better learned the material they were given. In conclusion, allow students to design their summer projects because the results would ultimately be very beneficial to all students.
