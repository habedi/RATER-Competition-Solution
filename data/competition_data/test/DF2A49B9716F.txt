Driving cars is a big thing for people now, but have we taken driving too far? Driving has increased major problems around the world. I think that we should limit our car usage sometimes though. It can help the environment, allow us to do activities outdoors, and decrease health issues.

Helping our environment is one of the biggest problems we are facing across the globe. Have you ever thought that a car is one of the leading causes of air pollution? In "Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog," Paris had to ban driving driving because the air pollution was so bad, they had to find a way to clear the air. Also, Bogota had to ban cars except taxis and buses in order to reduce smog, as it says in "Car-free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota.

Limiting our car usage will also allow us to do activities outdoors. We use our cars daily for work, school, visiting families, or for the park. Sometimes we even use it when we don't have to. "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," stores are placed near the block, so people can walk instead of using their cars. A media trainer, Heidrun Walter, even admitted that she has been so calm ever since she sold her car. People seem much happier and active without cars than with it.

Lastly, it can decrease health issues. Cars make a lot of pollution in the air, making it harder for people to breath fresh clean air. Congestion was at sixty percent in the Capital of France, as it says in "Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog." In all sources, it says that driving can even increase stress.

As a result, driving is a bad habit. we should limit our car usage so we can help the environment, so we do outdoor activities, and decrease health issues. We don't always have to drive in order to get to someplace. Decreasing car usage will help a lot of our problems we deal with each day.
