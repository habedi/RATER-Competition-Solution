Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do and do not believe that students with a C average should or should not get to participate in activities and sports.

I do not believe this because the student is not yet failing and should still get a chance to do something he/she may love. I think that it is almost like a punishment or a bribe to the students. For example, telling kids that the only way you can play sports is to keep a B average. Another example is telling them that if you get a B average or higher you will get to play sports and participate in activities at school. A third example is saying to them, "well you got a C on your report card so now you can not participate in sports or activities at school." It may also not be fair to the student. That student may be trying his or her hardest to get the best grades he or she can get but still might only get a C. I don't think that's fair for the student. I can understand a student with a failing grade not being able to participate in school activities and sports, but a C, i do not think that is fair at all. The student might be really athletic and be a good player on the field and just because of a C average, why would we take away the opportunity. He or she might also have A' s and B' s in all of his or her subjects except one and in that last one have a C.

That is only one C average, they others are all great. I just do not think this is fair for the student.

Reasons that i think this is a good policy to have is because it will help kids keep there grades up in all classes and help to get OMS on the list of good schools in MA. It will also make the kids, their parents, and their teachers at school be happier. They will know that their students/children/themselves are doing great in school, they have at least a B average and are participating in school activities.

I hope you enjoyed my letter about reasons for students with a C average to be able to participate in school sports and reasons for them not to be able to. I honestly would not really care which happened. This policy is your decision and i think you should do what ever you want to do.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
