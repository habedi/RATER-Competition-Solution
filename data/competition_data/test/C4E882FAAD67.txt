Dear Principal,

The matter of whether a student should or shouldn't have to do community service has come up and needs to be discussed.

I believe that it would be a good idea for students to take part in community service but i don't think they should have to do it.

Taking part in community service would have a huge effect on our surroundings.

More students would be out helping out those who are in need instead of sitting around doing nothing. This would also cause the students to get more active and they would come to know those who live around them.

Also, community service would look good on an application to college.

If you don't want to go to college, so be it. The fact is that community service is a good thing and students should be encouraged to take part in community service.

The encouragement of students to take part in community service should be increased.

If a student does not know where to take part in community service or how to do it, then the odds of them trying to anything will go down.

If signs or posters are hung up around the school then students mite pay more attention to their surroundings and get more active with their community. Even if they just went out side once a week to pick up garbage off the streets or even just around their house, it would make a huge difference to the community.

Other students might even see a student or friend picking up trash and want to go out side to help that friend or student out.

That would be causing the student to get active with their community and it would be helping out a lot of people.

So as you can see, if students just do the smallest things then they can be helping out the community.

The encouragement of the students toward community service would also impact the community because it would cause more students to get involved.

Just the picking up of trash would make an impact.

Those are my reasons of why kids should do community service but you shouldn't have to be forced to do it.

Sincerely,
