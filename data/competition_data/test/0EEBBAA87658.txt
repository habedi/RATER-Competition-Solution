The brightest point in the night sky, otherwise know as the planet Venus, is a very difficult place to discover. In the passage "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author talks about the dangers that exploring Venus brings along with it. The author supports this idea well by sharing the pros and cons of going there.

Although there are many risks, it could help scientists better understand how common Venus and Earth are. The author states that Venus' "temperatures average over 800 degree Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." These conditions are very extreme for any human because we aren't exposed to that type of heat and pressure at any discovered place on Earth. However, in the fourth paragraph, he says that Venus might have been "the most Earth-like planet in our solar system" and that it "still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth." Although these reasons are good for scientific purposes, the risk poses a huge threat for the way that NASA chooses to explore Venus.

The author supports this idea of exploring Venus very well by giving both pros and cons for exploration. They give facts about the climate there while also giving examples of how to avoid these dangers. He knows that Venus has value so the shouldn't stop them from finding out more from this cloud-draped world.
