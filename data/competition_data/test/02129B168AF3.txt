It was either I'm against or for the value of using technology to read students emotions. I happen to be against it, because yo uuse technology for working not reading emotions first of all. Two, we aren't lab rats.

I think that if you want to find out your emotions, you're pretty weird from my point of view. You should know how you feel, not letting a computer or any other technology ran device to find out your emotions. If you don't know your emotions that's because you have mixed thoughts. Your facial expression that you show to people as you walk around should tell them how you feel, for instance; looking upset shows many emotions, smiling could mean you're happy or just faking it because you're actually really depressed and don't want anyone to know. This technology that people are creating just to do that is a waste of time. Do something different, don't focus on something that people may not really even use. There are more reasons on way I am against it because all it did was just show a painting's emotions.

Therefore, that is why i am against this facial Action Coding Device. It makes no sense to me at all on why anybody would want to create this type of technology.
