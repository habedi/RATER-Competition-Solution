Venus is important to study because long ago it could of have supported life. But, now that there are dangers of studying the plant some call Venus, Earth's twin.

Studying Venus would be good for Earth because if Venus "could have supportted various form of life" means the somewhere in Venus curroded and if that it mite steer us away from becoming a secondary Venus. Do to Venus being very difficult to study because of the "pressure is 90 time greater than" Earth and it's temperature average being "over 800 degrees making it difficult to land on an stay living on for a medium period of time or enough time to gather sample for studying.

although that Venus would be good to explore for science sake. It would be a bad idea for the fact that Vence's atmosphere is mainly "sulfuric acid." We as a whole trying to do test flight to Venus was a good idea so that we know now is that going to Venus is a bad idea because in "three decades" "not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus." Do to these reasons I think it is a very bad idea to study Venus because of all the danger of it.
