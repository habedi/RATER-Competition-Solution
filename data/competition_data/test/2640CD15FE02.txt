What I think about classes online for kids who live far is that is not a good idea. It would distract tramandestly distract them from actully learn online. School should just upgrade transportation, and start school a little late.

Some schools offer classes online, for those students who trouble far distances to attend school. In my opion I think schools should not offer classes online. Do to the cause that now a days, student would prefer to hangout with their friends at parties, games, sleepover, and more. Student wouldnt pay as much attention as if they were in school. Student from short distance would probably argue about wanting classes online too. Some students might even want to wake up later then usual. I've seen some students who skip school becuase they wake up late, and they live far away. Some get late to school.

Student coming late to school, because they live far away. Schools should upgrade trasnportation instead of oferring classes online. Student from far away sometimes dont have any ride to school, therefore schools should invest in more capeable busses. The classes online would be fine for summer school. Since some kids fail classes during school year, they could retake the classes during summer, and the classes would be online. That is just my opion about having classes online for kids who live far.Â
