For some people a B grade average is too much. So they like to have a C grade average to participate in sports or other activities. Many student think that it would be hard work and that they would put hard effort to get a B grade average to participate in sports or other activities. Many students also think that at least a C grade average is a good grade. Student want to participate in sports or other activities because so they can gain more skills and so they can learn different things from different students and from different hobbies or activities. So what im asking you to do is for you to change the change that she made. Many students like to reach a grade average of a B, but they cant and it be wonderful of them to get a grade like that.

Students care about their grades but it is also very hard for them to work and work to get a B grade average. So what Im only asking for is for you to keep the grade average of a C for students to participate in sports or other activities. Thank you!
