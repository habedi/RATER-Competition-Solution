The idea of driveless cars would be a brilliant invention because of 3 big reasons. These three reasons are less accidents, economy could get better, and more work.

The rate of accidents could go dramastically because the people that drive irratically would no longer be behind the wheel.

There would be a computer sterring the wheel. People could not speed unless tey were in controll. SO therefore less speeding tickets.

The economy could get better because more money would get made from saling these cars. The junkyards would make more because a lot of people would scrap their old cars so that they could get those new carss. So that would be plus to all of these too.

More jobs would open up to statr selling these drivless cars so poverty would go down. This be a great thing so less people would be homeless.

Some people have been dreaming of cars like this for a long time.

This would mean a lot of great things happening in this country if this were tpo happen.
