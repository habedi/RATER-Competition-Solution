If you have to have a B average to play in sports, activities, etc. I think it would be a great idea because the students that like to play sports and such will or would try to get there grade average up resulting in good grades and a higher G.P.A. If my hypothesis is true, then with better grades you could get chosen to go to a good college like Yale.

Sports is good for exercise and fitness. If students cant increase there grade average, this would result in problems in the future like lack of fitness. Also if students want to try out for a sport such as Football, Basketball, etc, they cant. This would result in emotional behavior.

What i would like to ask the principal is "What is your proof that many students get a C grade average? what is the possibility of getting a C grade average?"

What i think should happen is that they should try this policy out for a year or two and see what happens, If students grade average goes up, down, or stays similar and then move on to keep the policy or to dismiss it.
