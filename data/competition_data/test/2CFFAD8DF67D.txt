Dear principal,

I think cell phones should be allowed at school. I think they should be allowed at lunch and all the other free periods. So I agree with Policy 1.

What would a child do if they had an emergency and they needed to call or text their parents for help? If cell phones are banned they couldn't do anything or risk having their phones get taken away.

On the other hand they should be off during teaching times, so that they wont be distracted. Also if the child is using their phone during school and someone takes it or they lose it, that is their fault. I also think if they are caught with their cell phones, they should lose the privilege of having it out during breaks.

So in conclusion I agree with Policy 1. And I think cell phones should be allowed at school, but at your own risk.
