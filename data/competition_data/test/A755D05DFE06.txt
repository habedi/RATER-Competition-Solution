Everyone has dreamed about aliens living on mars at least once in their life. As exciting as it would be to discover living beings on mars, there is no evidnece today that would support that theory. Here at NASA, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years. The Face could not have been created by aliens because there are no alien markings and there are landforms very similar to the Face here on Earth.

When analyzing a digital image, you can dicern things 3 times larger than the actual pixel size. If aliens had created the Face, there would be some kind of marking that the aliens would have made. On our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute maximum resolution. The images that we took showed no sign of any martian markings. This proves that aliens could not have created the Face on Mars.

Here on Earth we have many different types of landforms. One of which looks very similar to the Face on Mars. This landform is called a Mesa. These landforms here weren't created by living beings. They were created by natural causes, like erosion. So, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on Mars have been made by creatures? There is no evidence that proves the Face could have been created by alien life forms.

In conclusion, although everyone here on Earth would love to discover that the Face was created by aliens, there is no evidence that can prove that theory. There are not any alien markings and there are landforms on Earth that look very similar to the Face on Mars.
