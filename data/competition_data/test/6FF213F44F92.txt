if schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, they should be student-designed projects because students get more creative, wide-range of ideas, and just a higher chance of students completing their project during the summer break. if it was to be teacher-designed, students can follow the rubric created by their teacher.

Student-designed projects creates more creativity for students. there are so many things a students can project on. students already have such creative minds; teacher-designed will only limit that.

Also, We would have a wide-range of ideas to choose from. they dont just have to follow the teachers rubric and instructions.

Lastly, Students will most likely complete their project during summer break if it was something they came up with. during the summer the last thing im worried about is doing homework for school. im going on vacations, trips, parties. it be student-designed i can implement my project into my summer hobbies, making it fun to do.

In conclusion, schools should create student-designed projects rather than teacher-designed projects.
