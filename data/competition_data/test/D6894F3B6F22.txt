In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" they introduce new techonology, but it's not like our phones or computres this techonology will be able to detect any emotion you are fealing, rage,love,depression anyhing that has to do with emotion. They are predicting that this technology will be able to tell wheter or not a kid is confused or bored class. This could be good because the teacher might be willing to make up new and improved lessons intsead of the same boring old thing.

The reason I am against the Facial Action Coding System is becuase not everyone should be able to know what I am feeling. My facial expressions might show that I am upset over something so drastic but, its really i didn't get any pasta for dinner last night. Your expressions can read into to much. Then what, what are you suppose to when you find out everyone in your class either bored or upset you cant talk to everyone about their emotions not most people would want to open up, Which is understandable because you didnt come to school to have your teacher read your facial expression and start to anaylze everything about you.

Although I am glad we are able to make so much new technology and such high technology like FACS. It is not right to use the technology on students everytime they come into a classroom. The Facial Action Coding system should not be used in the classroom.
