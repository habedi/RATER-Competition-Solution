Throughout human history, education has been evolving and advancing. From textbook studying to using online programs, the education system is constantly adapting for the future. One of the numerous options of learning is by taking online classes at home. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it is safer, more comfortable, and better for their well being.

Students would benefit from online learning, because it is safer. At school, students come in contact with hundreds of people by force. The crowded hallways make it easy for diseases to spread. However, by taking online courses, students will be safe from any sickness, because they will not make physical contact with others. Going to school could also put a student's life in danger. School shootings are not rare, and it is difficult to protect every student from being harmed. Students will not have to risk their lives to learn if they attended class through video conference or online courses.

It is beneficial for students to attend online classes, because it is more comfortable. Most students would agree that they would rather be in the comfort of their own home than be at school. During school, students face needless stress from the environment they are in. Staying at home would not only be more relaxing, but it would also create the right headspace that is fit for learning. Ultimately, attending school from home would benefit students more, because it decreases their stress level and provides a more comfortable environment for them to learn.

Taking online courses or video conferencing is beneficial to students, because it is better for their health. For example, many students have to wake up 2-4 hours earlier than the school start time, because they must get dressed and catch the bus. This lack of sleep will cause them to be more likely to sleep during class and will make it more difficult for them to grasp the information. Most students also skip breakfast; they simply don't have the time to eat. Being hungry makes them lose focus on what is being taught. Students are starving and becoming sleep deficit because of school. However, students will be able to wake up at a more comfortable time and eat breakfast if they didn't have to leave their home.

It is understable that many say students will not benefit from home learning. Some reasons may be that they will slack off or cheat. Although these may be true, it is undeniable that it is more beneficial to learn in a place you are comfortable with than to learn in a place which you are forced to be at.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend class at home because it is safer, more comfortable, and better for their health. The hardest part of going to school is leaving your house. By taking online classes, they are in an environment that they enjoy. This method of learning has been invented for a reason; it is time to put it to use.
