Dear Principal,

I understand why you are reconsidering our school's cell phone policy. I know it can be extremely distracting to have someone texting or talking on the phone behind you. I believe that cell phones should not be completely banned from the school, but to let students use them during free time or lunch periods.

Students should at least be able to have their cell phones in their free time because of many reasons like athletics or extracurricular activities. If cell phones are banned from the school, students that are members of teams or clubs might need to call their parents to tell them what time to pick them up or even to tell a parent or guardian that they have a game or meeting after school.

If students have a study hall then I think they should be able to have their cell phones. Many students just roam the hallways during their study halls. It would be just as beneficial to have them sitting at a table texting or checking their e-mail online.

Lunch periods are a time for students to talk to their friends. If they could have a cell phone during that time they could talk to other friends from different schools. They could also be available to call a parent to ask for lunch money or a project they forgot at home.

There are many benefits to having cell phones during students' free time or lunch period. It is important to kids to stay in touch with all of their friends and if cell phones were available, they could do that. I do not think that having cell phones in certain times of the day would distract students from their studies. I think it would just give them a time to take a break from studies for a few minutes. It would help them focus more on their schoolwork during class instead of wondering how many new text messages they have received. I hope this letter has made an impact on your decision. Thank you.

Your student,
