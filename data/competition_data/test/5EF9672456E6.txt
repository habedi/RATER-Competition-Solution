Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I'm a student at your school. I understand that you are contemplating the idea of initiating community service requirements for the students to perform. In my opinion, this is a strong idea.

Community service performance is a good habit to get involved in. It can teach many life lessons such as; workmanship, hard work, taking initiative, being independent, being kind and generous and even learning different areas of help and work. Knowing these things can help anyone of any age in any area of the country with any task. community service can teach us to be better, more mature students and people. We will grow up with better life styles and we will be respected by many more. These lessons can teach us many things and with that we can apply them to our everyday lives. These skills can assist us during job interviews, school presentations, our future careers and even social events.

Community service can also help with college applications. Though we may not be old enough to be applying yet, community service can help with future applications. If we are accustomed to this idea at a young age, when we get older and are ready for that, we will have no problem completing and exceeding all necessary college application standards for community service.

Community service may not be enjoyable to everyone, but it is greatly appreciated by those around you. Many of my own friends do community service and apply that happy, kind nature to those around them. I also have friends that don't do community service and though I like them as friends, they don't like to get involved, and the "selfish" attitude they get when asked to head off to do something for someone else without anything in return makes community service seem more like a chore instead of fun, helpful activities. I'm not always one to jump up and say "Hey, let's go mow someone's lawn today!" especially not when I want to hang out with friends and hit up the mall and maybe a movie, but the good, accomplished feeling I get when I do something for someone without payment makes up for the hard work I do.

It may be a difficult decision for you to make being in the position you're in and all, but I believe whole-heartedly that each and every student, though they may not realize it, will learn a lot from this community service requirement. I think it will be a GREAT skill for all of us to have. Morals such as these will follow us through our whole lives and improve us, not only as students but as individual people.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
