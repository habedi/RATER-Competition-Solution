I agree that you should have to do extracurricular activities. Because its good to go out and do something. And you dont have to do justÂ sports you can do the yearbook, or do band and orchestra. Plus I think all kids should stay active. All in all I agree with doing extra curricular activities.

I think its good to go out and do something because. Kids have more energy than adults. And they need more exercise. And kids can become obese from doing nothing all day. Plus doing extra sports could be fun.

You dont have to do just sports. You could do band and play in the town parade. Or you could do orchestra. Plus, theirs always new stuff you could do if you dont like the thing your doing now. All in all i think kids dont have to do just sports.

Kids should stay active. One reason is so they can stay in shape and it wont be so hard when their adults. And most kids already do sports so maybe they might be able to convince their friends to do it with them. Allot of kids should stay active because its good for their well being. Thats the reasons I think kids should stay active.

In conclusion kids should do extracurricular activities. Its good for them. And it gets them out of the house. Plus it keeps them from being on video games all the time. All in all Kids should have to do extracurricular activities.
