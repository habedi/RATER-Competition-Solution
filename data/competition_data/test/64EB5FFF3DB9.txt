I believe that students in our schools should do community service. One reason is because it helps or makes the world a better place. It will make our schools look disgusting to everyone else. It also makes them think about the future in areas.

We are helping the world so much just by doing one little thing. Anyone can do this but people today are getting lazy. This will help so much if everyone picks up at least one or two pieces of trash a day. It is not hard to do this task every day. It will also help out animal such as squirrels, cats, dogs, and other things as well. Because to them every thing or anything that smells good is food so they will eat trash and other things.

Another reason is that it changes the look of the school, or other places. No one wants to go to a school that has trash everywhere on the floor. It would just make the school look bad that no one wants to go to that school. I think that everyone does not want to see trash everywhere they step.

Last thing is that it open young peoples minds. If they see someone picking up trash, it may give them an idea. One of the idea is them thinking about the future and how the earth will look like in a few years.

We can't change the world unless we change the thing around us. If we don't start soon our schools will look awful. So can we start or do we have to wait?
