I think the Facial Action Coding System can bring some help into classrooms. Most students, like myself, get bored when working on the computer. If the computer can read our face expression to see that we are bored and change what's on the screen to something more appealing, then maybe it would brighten the mood.

There's no doubt that most students don't like school and fine it incredibly boring. Working on the computers brings a sort of excitement because we prefer technology over standard teachings. Personally, I would prefer to sit on the computer, like I am now, and learn and do assignments. In fact, I'd rather be able to sit at home and work on school work and be able to take breaks whenever I feel like it.

School is like work, I hate it. if this FACS technology can brighten things up at school, then just maybe it wouldn't be so boring. Maybe I wouldn't mind getting up at 6:30 every morning to get ready and go somewhere I don't even want to go. I would love for a computer to read my facial expressions and change what's on the screen to something more suitable for me.

Like I said before, it's no surprise that the majority of students do not like school. This FACS technology could really have a bright future. If it all goes well then it just might make school a place where children and young adults would actually look forward to going to.
