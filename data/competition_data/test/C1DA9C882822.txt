Schools give many projects and homework assignments to assure the student knows the information, and it also gives them a chance to learn something new. Schools give projects during spring break, winter break, and even our longest break during the summer. Many of these projects are made or designed by a teacher, while some have a basic outline and are mostly designed by the students. Projects should be designed mostly by the students, and many agree with this statement as well.

Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this makes the students strengths and weaknesses easier to indicate. This allows the teacher to understand what his/her students need help with. They can guide the student on how to perfect their strengths and improve on their weaknesses. An example of this would be if a student is bad at giving examples in essays. If the student is given an essay on "What was the most impactful battle of WWII" , they have many examples to choose from and many reasons those examples would be chosen. But if the student is given an essay on "Why should video cameras be used" , their mediocre examples will be easier to notice as not as many facts back up the opinions on if cameras should be used or not. Some may say since student-designed essays show the students flaws, their flaws could cause them to get a poor grade. While this is true in some cases, it is better the student's teacher see his/her mistakes now and help them improve on them, rather than before the big test. Although this is indeed one, there are many more examples of why summer projects should be student-designed.

Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this allows more creative freedom and ideas on the essay/project. A student has free range to think of new ideas if they are not put on a metaphorical leash by the teacher. They can explore new ideas which in turn could make their essay much better and even teach the teacher something they never knew before. A satisfactory example of this would be if the teacher assigned an essay where the student could write about whatever they want, but they had to relate it to racism. The student could write about slavery, the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and they could even write about hip hop. But if the teacher tells the student to write an essay about " Why we read books" or " Why we eat food" the students will all have similar responses. They will say something along the lines of " We read books for the knowledge and information they give us" or " We eat food because food is a necessity our body needs to function properly". These essays/projects are very linear and do not bring anything creative to the table. A few may say that allowing full creative freedom on essays will cause students to drift away from the central idea of the essay and dive into personal opinion. Of course it is inevitable this will happen to some, good writers will know to not do this and will stay on the topic of their essay, while the writers who went astray will get some help from their teachers on how to improve that.

Summer break projects should be mostly designed by students because this will encourage the student to do better on their essays/projects. Allowing freedom on a project allows the students to try as hard as they possibly can, while if they were given a project on something that disinterests them, they will only do what is required. If a student that is a fan of Lil Uzi Vert(rapper) is given a project on " The Evolution of Classical Music" , they are only going to do the minimum requirements of that project, while if they are given a project on Effect of Old Rap on New Hip Hop" , they will be more interested as it relates to something they hold dear. Some people may say that the students should already be encouraged to do the project since it is an important grade at the beginning of your school year, which is true, but some students need to be motivated in order to want to go the extra mile, and doing a project on one of your favorite artists is the right motivation.

Summer break projects seem to have a negative vibe around them. Not many want to do them, and some think we shouldn't have them, but if we are going to have to do a project over the summer it should be about something e like or something we hold dear. Our families, our friends, our hobbies, our music taste, etc. Doing summer break projects on things that relates to us encourages us to do better, shows our flaws, and gives us freedom to run wild.Â
