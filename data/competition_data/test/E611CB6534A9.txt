Most cities are banning cars I don't think thats a good idea but limiting the usage of your car is better . Some people drive just to drive with or without license and thsts not safe . Also there are some people struggling and are only doing what they can.

To most people safety always come first in a automobile. Its not safe to drive without license , it might seem cool but its really not. Its putting your life and maybe someone elses life in danger. Driving without license will always have you at risk because if you get stopped you going to jail . If you were to be driving a car without license and its not yours you and the person who car it is , is going to get in trouble. Limiting car usage isn't as bad it saves you from getting into any trouble or even saves you from getting hurt . Riding a bike or getting on the bus will get you from one place to another safer than driving without license .

Furthermore , we have people in the world that say they need there car to get from one place to another. Cars are not really need it , it just get you to where ever you need to go quicker. The bus will get you from where ever you are to where you need to go just not as fast as a car will. A bike will do the same thing . They both also saves you money because with a car you will need to put gas in and if it mess up its really expensive to fix it .

Limiting car usage isn't really a bad thing but banning cars is . Like I said before cars are not needed but it need to be taking good care of because its expensive to fix on the other hand, the bus cost but not as much as a car do and the bike just takes up a lot of energy and can cost some money but not as much as a car so yeah to me limiting car usage is not as bad as people say or think it is .
