I know you may think that the face was made by aliens, but it isn't. How I know? Well in the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" NASA lists a whole bunch of reasons against this alien conspiracy. Number one, it is probably just another Martian mesa, which are common around Cydonia. Number two, it looks like a regular landform due to comparisons to Earths landforms. Lastly, number three, sometimes the face isn't even there due to its missing shadows. Conspirators would probably think that NASA would hide evidence of alien acts but NASA is so confident that this is not aliens that they showed the face to the public. You're probably thinking: Why should I believe you? Do you have evidence? As in fact I do.

Number one, it's probably just another Martian mesa. Scientists have proven that there are a lot of mesa's around Cydonia, a region on Mars where the face is located. "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." In this quote from the text it reveals how the face, if it is just a Martian mesa, is actually rather common on Cydonia. In that quote it also reveals that the face only has "unusual shadows" that give the face an effect of looking like an "Egyptian Pharaoh".

Number two, scientists claim it just looks like a regular landform. "What the picture acually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin." In this quote a man named Garvin has compared the face to some landforms on Earth. By comparing the face to a landform, it makes the face acually seem more like its just a regular landform.

Number three, sometimes the face isn't even there. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." Before this quote had even happened a man named Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture of the face only to realize it was just a regular landform. When the face was not in the picture that was supposed to be ten times sharper than the original Viking photo's proves that maybe the face is just a landform with unusual shadows for a face afterall.

Conspiracy theories believe that the face was made by aliens, but scientists have proven with research that that the conspiraters theory has a very big lack of credibility. Scientists have proven, number one, it is most likely just a Martian mesa with shadows for a face because Martian mesa's are common on Cydonia. Number two, its most likely just a regular landform due to its comparison's to Earths landforms. Number three, sometimes the face isn't even there because the shadows are gone. All of this resarch by NASA just proves that these conspriacy theories about aliens are wrong. Who do you believe now? NASA's research or a conspirators theory?
