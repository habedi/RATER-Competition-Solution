Continuous engagement is an indispensable component of student learning. Though, during the summer break, students are typically left to their own devices and whether or not they review information from the previous year or explore topics on their own is an entirely personal decision. Some schools, however, require a summer project to ensure the learning process of each student does not abate or stall during the summer. In these situations, a dilemma arises: is it more beneficial to have the teacher design this summer project or provide this opportunity for the students to undertake? Summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed because this allows students to effectively manage their summer schedule, create a personally engaging project, and develop creative and critical skills.

A student-designed summer project can properly adhere to individual students' summer schedules to allow enough time to relax and successfully complete the assigned work. Ultimately, students desire rest and time to enjoy personal activities during the summer; they are more likely to create a manageable project for themselves, since they should know how much personal time they allot during school and a summer completely free from obligation and can create a balance between them. Although, in high school, students may take up a summer job or continue a job begun during the school year (often in fast food or retail) to earn some personal expenses or aid in financially supporting their family. Students will be able to account for the time and effort spent during work if they design their own project. With a student-designed summer project, the assignment gains an inherent leniency to conform to each student's summer schedule to a greater degree than a teacher-designed project.

The subject matter and presentation of the project will likely be more personally engaging in a student-designed project, since they are provided more liberties to explore a topic in a manner they choose. Generally, final assessments cover a wider range of topics and allow for investigation or elaboration into an area of interest for the student. A summer project functions similarly, as students have an increased involvement in the choice of topics and the manner in which they are explored. With this freedom, students are capable of delving further into a certain concept of interest and, as a result, conduct the project with a greater level of enthusiasm. The higher personal engagement a student has in any assignment, the more readily and more thoroughly they will accomplish the task.

When students are able to design their own projects, they develop creativity through the design process of the project and critical skills as they assure the project aligns with all the set requirements. Many students typically view creativity as directly and exclusively related to the arts, but creative thinking is any "outside-of-the-box" or innovative, developmental thinking. Through the design process, students are able to develop their creativity by reimagining how to explore a topic in a unique and interesting way. However, the project must also be examined critically, as it must meet any criteria set for its assessment and be a sensible demonstration of the assignment. Creative and critical thinking are essential in problem solving and expanding on the ideas students manifest while designing their projects.

The idea of a teacher-designed project does have advantages, however, and should not be overtly discarded before giving the concept due consideration. An assignment created by a teacher will likely match the presentation of subject matter students have encountered in class. Although this creates a level of consistency in structure, it also limits the forms of information the student is exposed to. Additionally, the teacher would be able to address any questions or concerns about a project they designed more accurately than those of a student-designed project. However, teachers are not completely barred from assisting students with issues they experience with student-designed projects, since they still have knowledge on the subject matter and any requirements established for the project. Despite the involvement a teacher has in students' learning, they cannot know every detail of each student's situation during the off-time of summer and design a project which can be equally applied to every student during this time.

For a summer project, a student-designed assignment provides more benefits than a teacher-designed project. Students are able to consider their summer schedule, design a personally engaging endeavor to undertake, and develop creative and critical thinking skills throughout the design process. Although a teacher-designed project aligns itself with previous presentations of the topics, this is inherently limiting to the students' exposure to new ideas. Teacher aid remains available, however, even if the project itself is not designed by a teacher. Personalization and the development of thinking skills are key benefits of a student-designed project. Even during the summer, there is no reason for the learning process of any student to cease, and a summer project is a useful tool allowing independent study. Learning is a life-long experience and the exploration of new ideas should never be restricted by unnecessary boundaries.
