When was the last time you participated in a school activity? Participating in some extracurricular activities is actually a great way to represent your school. Things such as playing a sport for your school, working on the schools yearbook, writing a school newspaper, or serve on the student council are some great ways you can participate in school activities. Although, some activities can be a stress reliever for some students, others can also cause stress to some pupils that already have a lot on their plate. That being said i believe that it should not be obligated to participate in a extracurricular activity, but instead it should just be left as a choice.

As I mentioned before, sports are a great way to participate in extracurricular activities. Not only is it good for that, but participating in sports in general relieves a lot of stress, helps with exercise so it's good for your health, and a great way to practice partnership and communication. If you are on a team for your school, college coaches can come to your school and see how you and your team play. If they like how you play and want you on their team you can get a scholarship become a professional and make a career out of it, if you really love playing that sport. You never really know what the future holds, and a lot can come out of one choice and or decision you make. I believe participating in a school sport is the activity that most students would choose because a lot of pupils love sports and it is a fun activity to do with your friends and others.

Other activities that I mentioned were helping on the schools yearbook, writing a school newspaper, serve on the school council, and etc. Things like this can maybe give students extra credit though it would depend on what you are participating in. This might also look good in college interviews because it is showing them that you were interested in school activities and were well managed with the things you had to do in them. If you are a person who is well managed these activities would be great to join. They can also, help you improve on your photography, writing, and managing skills. Even though these activities are great, and good to show on college interviews it is still not a good reason to obligate this choice for students, because some can feel like they have way to much things to keep track of and adding an extracurricular activity on their hands is just too much for them to handle.

In conclusion, i believe yes that these activities should be free for all, but should not be an obligation. Instead of obligating it as a must it can be left as a choice and or option for students who would like and enjoy participating in the school activities. I disagree in the fact that making students participate in extracurricular activities should be a must. Some students have too much on their plate and just do not have the time to participate in these activities. Some scholars can also feel stressed out and or pressured by having to see or choose what activity they like that interests them so they can join. In my opinion i would not obligate this option, and would just leave it as a choice.
