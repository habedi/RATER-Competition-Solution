I am going with Policy 1. This policy allows students bring there phones and use them during free time. I believe we could bring our phones to school and keep them because if you play a sport you have practice after school. If there was something to happen or go wrong you could call 911. If you are walking and you fall and break a bone. This is some of the reasons i think we could bring our phones to school.

If you play a sport you have practice after school. If your mom and dad get off after school and they go home you have to have a way to get up with them so they can come pick you up. If we could bring our phones to school we could call them and tell them that it is time for them to come pick us up. We could only do this if we could bring our phones to school.

The next reason is if there is a problem like a teacher getting held a t gun point. If this happened the teacher could not do anything because he is at gun point. If we did not have our phone we could not do anything until the bell rang our someone heard a gun shot. If we had our phones we could call 911 and tell the what is happening and the would come an d take care of the things that was happening.

if we where go to run an aron for a teacher during class and on our way up there we fall and break our leg we could call the school or the nurse.
