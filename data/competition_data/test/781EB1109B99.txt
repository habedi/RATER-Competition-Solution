Dear Principal,

I do believe that community service is important but I do not support the idea of forcing students to perform community service. Yes, it cleans up the environment but not all students or kids are interested in doing community service. Most children believe that that's why we have Garbage men to pick up our trash on a certain day of the week. Those who have time on their hands and perform community service to help our world become a better place that's good for them and we are pleased to know that we have citizens that care about the kind of world we live in. Some or I'm sure that most children do not care to help the environment, they might choose to go hangout with friends or play video games. As for the children who do not perform community service, you should at least conserve water, recycle plastic bottles and aluminum cans. When you litter , you're not making the world you live in a better place. You are polluting the own world you live in and breathe from. The principal should create a program to help save the environment and to keep our oceans and the oxygen we breathe, clean. This program should not force students to join the program or perform community service, If the students wish to go green and help the environment, then they will join the program make our nation pollution free.
