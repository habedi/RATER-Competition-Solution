Studying a planet called Venus is worthy pursuit but it is dengrous. As we have seen in the paragraph exploring Venus can teach us alot of things and there is alot of things that we can learn in Venus like if there is a life in there or if we can grow something there but no man have put his foot on it because it is too dengrous and too hard to go over there.

As we seen in the first paragraph Venus, sometimes called the "Evening Star" because it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is also known as Earth's "twin" since it is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus is sometimes right around the corner and humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each pervious mission is no man which mean just airplane or robot because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, that is the reason the no man have ever step on it. For others reason it is too hot even though Mercury is closer to our sun. The averange on the planet surface is 800 degrees which can kill us and it has greater pressuer than earth. It is 90 times greater than earth. The others reason is that it has powerful earthquakes,erupting, and frequent lightning steikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. To get over there NASA is trying to make thing that can land on the planet and stay for a very long time, so that they can explore.

So alot of our people are trying to go to Venus but it is challenging. They are trying and become stronger. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited b dangers and adoubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
