Imagine it was a hot summer day and a student is at home complaining to their parents that they want to hang out with their friends. Instead, their parents refused and they had to stay home to do their summer project that was assigned by their teacher. This will result in the student becoming really stressed and sad because they won't be able to spend time with their friends during their summer break. Summer projects should be student-designed because students can choose what projects they are interested in, they will be able to retain the information more easily, and they will be able to have fun with their friends while doing these projects.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students can choose what projects they are interested in. My friend Generic_Name, who is a high school student, wants to becoming a pharmacist when she gets older. She has been telling me that she really wants to volunteer at a pharmacy for her summer project. This is because she is interested in helping others, while still learning about the health science aspect of medicines. This shows that Generic_Name is spending her summer wisely by choosing what she is interested in doing, and learning the information while at the pharmacy. It is important for Generic_Name to choose what she wants to do with her time during the summer since it could be beneficial for her. This is because she would rather learn useful information that will help guide her career path in the future, instead of making a poster about chemistry vocab terms that was assigned by her teacher, since she would probably be bored and not enjoy it. Furthermore my cousin Generic_Name, who is a junior in high school, wanted to make a sculpture that could be displayed at her school for her AP art class. She feels that choosing to make this art project could help her learn about the major concepts of building sculptures. This shows that Generic_Name is spending time in the summer doing what she loves to do, while still learning relevant information at the same time. Some may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed because some students might be indecisive when choosing what they are interested in and want to do for their summer project. However, summer projects should be student-designed because even if they are indecisive, they will eventually choose a project that would definitely help them in the future and will enjoy doing as well.

Furthermore, summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to retain the information more easily. My friend Generic_Name, wants to become a math teacher when she gets older because she loves being around kids, and doing fun math problems. During the summer, Generic_Name wants to volunteer as a math tutor for elementary school kids, and create a poster on what she learned from this experience for her summer project. This shows that she is choosing to do something she is really passionate for, so Generic_Name will most likely be happy to do this project and will retain the information easily. It is important for students to be able to retain information while doing something beneficial, like a project, because they could learn more things that they haven't learned before when they choose their own ideas for their project. Some may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers will organize these assignments in a certain way for students to understand and memorize the information more easily. However, summer projects should be student-designed because if students enjoy what they are doing and learning over the summer, they are most likely to retain that information. This is because they tend to be more interested about the information they choose to learn, instead of a teacher assigning students to do a research paper of a famous math person for their project.

Lastly, summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to have fun with their friends while doing these projects. My friends and I are interested in volunteering to become Chinese tutors for kids. We love the the language and helping younger kids, in order for these kids to expand their knowledge in Chinese. We decided it would be fun for all of us to do this summer project together, because it would be enjoyable for us and be a good learning experience. If we volunteer to become Chinese tutors, it shows that we are demonstrating our Chinese knowledge in the writing and speaking areas to these kids. It is important that we have fun in the summer, while still learning information that could be useful in our futures. This is because we only get a limited amount of time to spend time with friends and have a break from school. Some may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed because they like when students work on projects by themselves, since students tend to be distracted if they work with friends. However, summer projects should be student-designed because students tend to like spending summers with friends, since during school they have less time to hang out. As a result if they get to choose their project, they will be able to have a chance to work with friends while continuing to learn in the summer.

Ultimately, summer projects should indeed be student-designed. After all, students can choose what projects they are interested in, they will be able to retain the information more easily, and students will be able to have fun with their friends while doing these projects. Many students should take action and let everyone know why it's best for students to be able to choose what they want to do during the summer, in order to continue learning, enjoy their summer, and benefit them in the future. Do teachers really understand the stress and anxiety they put on these students during summer from these projects they choose that will most likely not even help them?
