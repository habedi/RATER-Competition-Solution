Was it aliens or was it a landform? Many people think that the face on Mars was created by aliens but there is a lot of evidence to support the fact that it is just a landform. For example, the fact that the Face looked like a rock formation, the use of a different camera to show every little detail, and the point that the picture actually shows the landform which is a butte or a mesa.

First off, when NASA first found the picture they unveiled the image to the public to catch their attention. The caption of the picture read "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This example shows that it looked like a human head but it was a rock formation.

Second, in paragraph eleven, the author says "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added. "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" Clearly this example proves that if aliens were the ones that created this face, their would be proof because with this camera you would be able too see any trace of anything that was there or footsteps of aliens.

Lastly, paragraph twelve states what the "image" was. "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms commond around the American West." This example says that what it was in reality was landform.

To end this arguemnt, right now in your head you might be thinking "Pheraps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze." Well, that is why the NASA used a three times better camera to reassure the public of the landform. In conclusion, there examples, rock formation, camera quality, and the fact that NASA said it was a landform, that aliens were not the ones who created this face but it is a natural landform.
