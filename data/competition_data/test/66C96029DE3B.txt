Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard you are making new rules to the students of SCHOOL_NAME about how every student must participate in community service. I think that is a very excellent idea on the hand i have a few disagreements with it.

First, some students may not eligible because they need more help than others do and they can only do so much, but after a few hours or days they wont be able to do not as much anymore.

On the other hand is that they would still be able to do work when they feel better. I know this because one of my friends are like this and when I go over to her house she is unable to do a lot of things.

Secondly, when students might be doing community service they never know if one of their family members has passed and wont know till they get home. People has made my dad do community service, and when he got home he didn't have no clue his mom died. He wasn't able to go to the funeral because of community service.

Lastly, Some kids miss school and they miss class work and what they were supposed to learn that day. Kids can do community service in their yard and anywhere else they can think of. I believe students should do community services but only for the ones who has been disobedient toward their teachers and their classmates. The students who have been obeying and not acting up while in class should not have to do it unless they choose to.

I would like to thank you for giving me this time to speak with you and see my point of view of it. Community service is a good way for unpleasant kids should do and see if they learn their lesson. Have a good day sir

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
