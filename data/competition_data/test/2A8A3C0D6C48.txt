In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", explains how technology created by Prof. Thomas Huang and his colliague Prof. Nicu Sebe have been devolping better ways for humans and coputer to communicate. Almost all people can read someone's emotion through the expression they give even through a fake smile, and some over look this. Say it's chritmas and your parents get you a bag of grape fruits, you probably are going to be unsatisfied or annoyed, angry even. If it was from your parents though your going to put on a show and smile and and probably say things like "wow, this is awesome". Faking an expression like this will most definently fool your parents, but with this new technology you would simply be able to know how you child is feeling.

The question is though whether or not the use of this technology would be useful in students classrooms be valuanle. To some teachers it might affect them to the fact students keep falling asleep or not doing homework, and maybe just maybe with this technology you would be able to change your teaching style to create a more fun, interesting time in class. Honestly though It doesn't need to be used in classes. Why would you need to use it in the classroom. People have different emotions everyday, heck every second. Why would you need a device that reads emothions for school. This technology would be much better used in a game or a useful tool for phsycologist. There is no reason for it. If you had it would you use it to change the way a student is feeling probably not. Just cause there is technology that can determine somene's emotion doesn't mean it can change the way that person is feeling. Sometimes people need to fake the truth anyways.
