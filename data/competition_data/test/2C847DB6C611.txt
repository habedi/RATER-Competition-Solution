In 1976, NASA was taking pictures of Mars and found what looked like a human face looking at them. When the news got to the public they emediatly jumped to the conclution that it was an alian artifact. I can reasure you that it is nothing more than a natural landform that looks like a face.

When NASA went back to retake pictures on April 5,1998, it showed that there was nothing at all but a nautral landform. The public still were not agreeing on it just being a landform due to them taking the pictures on a cloudy winter day. So the NASA team took pictures yet again on April 8, 2001. This time a cloudless summer day.

Garvin, a NASA worker, says,"If there were objects in this picture like airplains on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" The 2001 pictures showed the "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa."

So I rest my case. Even though an alian civilization on Mars is a really awesome thought, its proven to be not true. The face on Mars is no alian arifact, but just a really cool natural landform that looks lilke a face.
