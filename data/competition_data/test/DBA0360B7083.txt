I feel like it would be a good idea to have one of these in schools because, it can one tell how a student is feeling on any certian day. Along with that it can possibly predict how a student or a teacher will react to something that happens in the school or what another person says.

It can also help the students with their work if the computer can tell that a student is struggling with their assignement, it can give them easier question but still get the point across for the class. I also backed this from the article because it mentions that a classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoing confused or bored.

Another reason I think it woud be a good idea to have these in classrooms is, there are some students that learn better on a computer and this will help them if they do not understand a subject. There is also other students that can not learn if most of there course is online and to difficult for them. So this system could possibly tell a teacher or another staff member that this student does not work well on a computer.

These are my reasons to as why I feel like it would be a good idea to have the Facial Action Coding System in a school. I feel like it can benefit some students off the jump and, I also feel like it can help some students get to where they need to be if they are struggling.
