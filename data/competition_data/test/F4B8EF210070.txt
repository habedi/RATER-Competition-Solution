Dear Principal,

Community service can be very rewarding to a students life. Many think of it as boring or stupid, but it can have a lot of positive effects on a persons personality and social life. Community service can create, in some students, respect and responsibleness that was not acquired before. In the end, it could help them learn the skills they need for their dream profession. It also makes the student more of a possibility for scholarships to a certain college or university with service hours on their application.

Very few teenagers actually participate in community service, and most who do don't do it often. This is because most students believe that it is a waste of time and takes away from the time they could use to play video games or hang out with their friends. In my opinion, if you make the service seem fun more students will get involved. Also if they are allowed to be with someone they know or are friends with they are more than likely to want to participate in whatever community service is being performed.

I believe community service can become useful and I strongly agree that it should become required of all students.
