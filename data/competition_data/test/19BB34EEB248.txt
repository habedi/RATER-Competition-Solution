The advancement of technology during the last few decades has made learning and education much easier for students; from using Google to find answers to watching videos on YouTube that explain learning topics thoroughly. Some schools have began to use apps such as Google Classroom as a teaching and learning platform for teachers to teach students and for students to turn in their completed assignments for scoring. There are also some schools, colleges and universities that have made distance learning an option for their students to attend classes from home by online and video conferencing in order to give them the opportunity to learn under almost any circumstances. Schools should continue to make it an option for students to attend classes from home because, it creates a new learning environment for students, it helps students have a more flexible schedule and teaches them new skills, and it allows students to take multiple online classes that will help build them for their careers.

Schools should continue to make it an option for students to attend classes from home because, it creates a new learning environment for students. Instead of forcing students to stay in school for a long time in a day, they should be given more opportunities to learn from home through online or video conferencing. This will help them learn effectively in their own comfortable space from home. Some students tend to not feel entirely comfortable in their classrooms. The tension they feel from being in a class they are not fully comfortable in may cause them to not fully participate in all the class activities as they would want to which may hinder them from learning what they are required to learn. If students are given the opportunity or option to learn from home, they can find themselves a comfortable space where they can stay and easily understand what they have been taught. An example being a coffee shop. Studies show that when one stays in a particular place for a long while, they get tired and bored which may begin to affect their work ethics. Students are required to stay in school for about 6 - 8 hours for 5 out of 7 days in a week, with some even staying after school for a few more hours which makes their situation even worse. The fact that students are required to stay in school for long hours through out the week is the reason why some students tend to not do too well in classes like they use to as the year progresses.

Thus, students should continue to have the option to take classes online or through video conferences because, it may help students attain a more flexible schedule and teach them new skills. People tend to work much better when they are under less stress. For example, when a student who plays sports is forced to spend long hours in school they loose the time that can be used to do homework, attend practice and hang out with friends, which puts a lot of unnecessary pressure and stress on the individual because they are given very limited time to get all their work done and together. It causes them to be sometimes sleep deprived which affects their learning skills. If students are allowed to take classes through online and video conferences, they can create a schedule for each day where they can have their days and plans laid out clearly to make life easy for them. With all these opportunities, a student can get their homework done, attend sport practices, hang out with friends/ or plan study times with them and get other personal things done such as going to a doctor's appointment without missing hours of school or class. Through all these opportunities, students can learn time management skills and even build healthy relationships with others that can benefit them in the future. They can also acquire new learning skills where by they won't always need to have someone standing in front of or by them to tell them what to do. This will force them to learn how to figure things out on their own which will also be a great skill for the future.

Furthermore, online courses should be made available to all students because, it will allows students to take multiple online classes that will help build them on their career paths. Students will be much more privileged if they are allowed to take classes through online and video conferences because they will be able to take all the courses they would need to take before going on a higher academic level. Due to the mandatory schedules the schools have set for students, they are usually unable to get some credits needed to attend college, which at times slows the students down when it comes to building their career. The availability of classes through online and video conferences will help them build schedules that will open doors for them to take the classes they need and want that will help them build their careers. They will be made able to take as much classes as needed that will yield all the credit they may need for college. Online classes make learning easier for students but then may affect their communication and social skills in a negative way, causing them to loose certain manners when it comes to communicating with people face to face.

Although others may still think allowing students to have the option of taking online classes may not be very benefiting, making online classes available for students will always be the best and smartest option. The option of taking classes through online and video conferences is always best for students because, it helps create a new learning environment for students, it enables students have to create a more flexible schedule that benefits them and teaches them learning new skills, and it allows students to take multiple online classes that will help gain credits for higher levels of education in order to build their careers.
