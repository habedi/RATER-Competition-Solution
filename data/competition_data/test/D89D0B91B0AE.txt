I am both against and for this new techonology device. It has both good and bad things to it and I will explain both why I think its a good idea and why I think its a bad idea, Here is why I think its a good idea. It can be a good idea for the guidance office of a school if a student is there for help. They can tell if the student is happy, sad, angry, or disgusted. It can help them understand what kind of emotions that practicular student is feeling, It also can be good with the example the author provided where if you smile on your computer a web ad appears but if you frown the next ad will be different. These examples are great ideas of why this technology device can be a great and helpful device.

This technology device could also be a bad idea and here is why, The device could be used on a student that doesn't really feel comfortable about giving their emotions to another person. If students have so much freedom with this device to read anyones emotions it could result in someone getting uncomfortable. Not everyone is going to want their emotions to be exposed. So if you give this device to some people they could easily humilate someone by exposing their emotions at the wrong time. For example, it could go wrong if a boyfriend was to use it on his girlfriend without the girlfriends permission and could ruin their relationship just like that.

In conclusion to these arguments supporting the technology and going against it. The device should be used in hands that are supposed to have it. Someone who has experience with the device and not anyone who is new. Someone who is mature enough to use it with polite manners, Not someone who is going to use it on each and every person they see. But use it with permission and not without someones consent.
