With the technology that we are capable of using to create a spaceship to have astronomers study Venus from a distance and gather information is a massive jump leading to a future where more than likely NASA could get a better understanding on our sister planet.

With deeper knowledge of a planet so similar to earth, it could really boost us and lead to bigger andvancements such as creating rovers or spaceships that can sustain Venus' enviorment for more than just a couple of weeks. With an ability to have rovers or spaceships that can sustain the enviorment, NASA can get a better understanding and get more evidance so that deeper, and more complex studies on Venus can be taken part in. With an advancement in technology in spacecrafts, scientists can achieve better understanding of the planet and its atmospere, Scientist can get more complex answers and evidance on the age of the planet, and its atmospheric pressure. Due to so little data or lack of technology to get more advanced studies of the planet, it has been difficult to get more answers than what we already have.

In conclusion, although the trips to study gather information on our sister planet, Venus, more information and evidance on the planet could let sicentists find a find a way to maybe inhabit Venus or if not, just get deeper knowledge on it.
