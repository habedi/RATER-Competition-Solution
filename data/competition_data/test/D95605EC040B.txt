In "The Challenge of exploring Venus" the author very well suggests that study of Venus is worthy despite the dangers. The author does this by stating the dangers and the way NASA is trying to over come these dangers. NASA is doing reserch and test to try to find a way for a mechion to last up there. There is a lot of reason why the author very well supports the idea studing Venuscis a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

A reason why the author supports this claim is in the texts its states,"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." We can maybe learn more about Earth by learning about Venus because they are simlar in a lot of way. That is why it is important to try to find a safe way to explore Venus.

Another reason is beacuse in ghe texti s states,"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." If Venus only could have supported life if we explore it we could find fossles of creatures we mever knew exsited. That is why that is another reason.

These reason and so much more is why this is worth the dangers to explore Venus. The author put reserch into this artici to bake it up and they did it good.
