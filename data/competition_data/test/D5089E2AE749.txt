I am for the driverless cars. I beleive that these driverless cars will help decrease car accident rates, some driverless cars use less gas fuel. some people believe such cars would change our world, and i agree.

Driverless cars can help decrese car accident rates as i mentioned earlier. In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming", it says in paragraph two " Google has had cars that could driven independent under specific conditions since 2009." These cars has driven more than half a million miles WITHOUT a crash, then again Google cars havent truly been driverless.

The driverless Google cars modified Toyota Prius have lots of sensors that are located on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror and many more. Theese cars are safe they have to be safe the driving law focus on saftey for the passengers, drivers, and pedestrians. some cars have sensors in the front and back that will break for you so you wont hit another car. That will help the drunk drivers fromhitting teen drivers and killing them.

Driverless cars will come in handy they are safe, and harmful. Drivers will still be able to control their cars. These cars will alert you when you need to take control , when you need to stop or they will stop for you. Cars that can drive themselves and keep drivers from hitting others equals a safter raod for young drivers.
