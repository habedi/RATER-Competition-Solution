Venus a. k. a the Evening Star is one of the brightes planets when you look into the night sky. however it sometimes is accidently named wrong and Venus is simply easy to spot from earth but is more safe away from earth. It's sometimes often refered to as earth's "twin" because its the closes't planet to earth. some missions were unmanned because most of the spacecrafts never survived the landing for more nan a fiew hours the issue probably eplaines why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus for more than 3 decades numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. even though we are trying to get to Venus and make sure the spacecraft landed and survived it. it's gonna take a long time to get the suplies for that. astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in the solar system. Long befor it Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and clould have supported various forms of life just like earth. today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.
