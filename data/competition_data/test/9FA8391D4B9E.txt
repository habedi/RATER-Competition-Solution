Dear Mrs. Principal,

I think students should have at least a B average to be on a sports team or participate in any other activity.

Here are the reasons why I think that and why it's bad to let students with bad grades join a team or activity.

The students might need to pay more attention in school, and sports or activities might distract them from doing their work.

I think the best solution is to only allow students with at least a B average to be on a sports team or do any other activity.

They shouldn't be allowed to unless they get their grades up higher than a C.

Kids might think that sports or activities are more important than school work, so they would just start to forget about school and not care about their grades.

They might start coming up with excuses for not doing their homework or being ready for a test saying, "I had practice," or "I was really busy last night."

And then they are going to stop caring about their grades and how they do in school.

Students should only be allowed to be on a sports team or in any activity if they are trying their best in school and getting good grades.

You don't want kids to slack off and do poorly, do you?

I think not being on a sports team or doing any activity can hurt your school work and it will be harder for the kids to stay on task and focused.

Also, if you tell the students that have less than a B, that they aren't allowed to be on any sports team or participate in any activity unless they have at least a B, they might want to be on that team or in that activity so badly that they change their grades and do better in school.

Did you ever think about that?

And then the students can have fun and also have good grades.

I think that it's very important to get good grades because it depends on your life ahead of you in the future.

If you don't do well in school, it might be hard to get into a good college, or you won't even get into one at all.

And usually kids that start slacking off in middle school, don't do much better in high school and might even drop out which isn't the answer.

They could change into bad students and they won't know how to make the right decisions and they would fall into the trap of peer pressure.

When people grow up, whether they are good or bad, a lot of peer pressure happens and it might be really hard to say no.

I think that if you're well educated and you try your best in school, get good grades, and make good choices, you won't need to worry so much about peer pressure.

The kids that are the opposite and don't do good in school, don't care about their grades, and make bad choices, are going to get themselves in trouble.

Thank you for your concern and please think about not letting the students be on any sports team or activity while their grades aren't at least a B.

I appreciate it.

Sincerely,
