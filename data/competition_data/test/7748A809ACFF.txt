Hi i'm Generic_Name and I hope you enjoy my essay. I disagree with this decision because I think its to hard on the students. I also think that this principal is to hard on the students.

One reason I disagree is to much stress. Because the kids already have more classes. And practicing out of school for this activity would be to hard considering they already have homework. And it would either shorten or make the day longer for the student's. And it might narrow down the students classes, if that happens then they probably wouldnt get everything done which would leave it for homework.

My second reason is to much practice and work out of school. So if you signed up for a sport then you would have to practice out of school to get better. Or if you signed up for art you would actually have to practice drawing. And if you do a extra activity and a instrument one of them would be practiced less. On top of all of that you have to study for classes out of school.

And my third and final reason is that the kids would be to tired. Because some kids have to do chores after school. And because they would have to practice and study. And if a kid is already doing a sport out of school they would have to go to that right after the extracurricular activity. And they would have to do homework.

In this essay I talked about how kids would be tired and how it would be to much stress. I also talked about how it would be to much practice out of school.Â I disagree with this decision because I think its to hard on the students. I hope you guys enjoyed my essay on why I disagree with extracurricular activity.
