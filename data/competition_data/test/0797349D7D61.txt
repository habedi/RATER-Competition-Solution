I think the students should take part time in community service so the students can help out and do what they want too.

Its perfect but some might try to shorten the part time, although it not much a serprize.

Kids tend to take an advantage on things like that which brings me to put full time.

I am not going to tell you what to do but I would like it to be part time so kids won't get angry and hate it less.

I would also put in that kids might like to have it to be fun and so the work would go fast and so it will be fun.

Maybe soon we could put in full time so the students will hopefully learn that work is important.

I think only a certain amount of students should be selected who need it.

I hope that some of my friends would know that they have to let go to make things better, make a sacrifice.

I also think my friends in community service should show my other friends how fun it is.

Also with saying all students, I think most students should choose besides the need one otherwise it is forcing.
