There are many schools that require students to complete a summer project. Most of these projects are either student designed or teacher designed. However, these summer projects should be designed by students all of the time. The projects should be designed by students because they would show each students creativity and passion but also show their ability to work on something independently.

First, the ability for students to design projects would allow them to express their creativity in unique ways. If each student designs a project there would be countless different creative and unique versions. For example, one student might make a movie for his project while another student creates a podcast. This creativity would not only make projects more interesting but students may also enjoy them more because of the creative freedom. On the other hand, if the project was teacher designed there would less variation and a lot of of the same boring and bland projects. Clearly, summer projects should be student designed so students can express their creativity.

Secondly, if students designed their projects they would have the ability to do projects about something they're passionate about. If students did their projects on what they were interested in they would most likely do a lot better job and put more time into it. For example, a student who is interested in cars would put more effort into a project about cars rather than if a teacher assigned him a project about wildlife. In addition, this project about wildlife would probably end up not expressing creativity and lacking information because there would be no passion for the project. Also, the ability for a student to do research on a topic that interests them allows for them to learn about something that could be a potential career choice in the future. While researching a student may learn that the topic is not quite what they thought it was or may learn that it's something they wanna continue to gain more knowledge about and make a career of it one day. Obviously, summer projects should be student designed, so students can learn about their passions and be motivated to do a better job.

Lastly, a student designed project would show their ability to work on something independently. If student designed more of the workload falls onto the student than the teacher. The ability to design and complete an entire project without any teacher help would take massive amounts of independent work skills. In addition, the ability to be independent is very important, and one day students will be out on their own without any teacher or adult to show them the way. This project has potential to teach students how to do things independently. However, if teacher designed the students would have everything laid out for them but that is nothing like the real world in, which a person will have to do everything on their own. All in all, the potential to learn how to do things independently is massive with a student designed project.

Many schools have summer projects that must be completed over the break and some of these projects are teacher designed. Although, when teacher designed these projects lack creativity, interest from students, and independent work skills. Therefore, these summer projects should be student designed so that they are creative, interest the students, and teach students how work independently.
