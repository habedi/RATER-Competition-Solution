Venus is called the "Evening Star" although it is a planet not a star. Venus is the secound closet to the sun and the closet to Earth. Venus is a challenging planet to studay because of its features. Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Venus is also hot enough to melt many metals. Venus temperature is averge 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 90 times hotter than Earth. A spaceship that lands on Venus could not last for more than a few hours because of the conditions. Even under these dangerous conditions scientists today are studying ways to safely study Venus.

Venus it is the closet we have to another Earth. Like how Venus use to have oceans and supported some type of life. Even today, the article claims that Venus has things like valleys, mountains, and craters. Since Earth is becoming older and weaker because of human activities, we would need something that is more Earth like. Other than Mars, Venus is the closet planet to Earth. Venus has the weather that Earth has like earthquakes, volcanoes, and lighting.

Even though Venus is dangerous it will still be the best thing to go to since Earth is getting older and weaker because of how long Earth has been living and also because of human activities. I think if scientists researched Venus and found ways to put technology on Venus to discover its features. NASA has made simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. Then scientists even suggested hovering over Venus, but it would still be hot at 170 degrees Fahrenheit. They could find ways that humans could adapt to the planet or they could find ways to make Venus even more Earth like.
