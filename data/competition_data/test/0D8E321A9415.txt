Do you think that every student should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Well, in my opinion I don't think that students should have to be forced into that. Doing that could cause a lot of stress on many of people. That being said, the parents of those students would then have to worry extra about any activity their children is participating in. Now, think about all the trouble the kids that are disrespectful would cause. That would mean more trouble-making kids to deal with all the time. I disagree with this decision because not all students have the extra time, permission from their parents, or they might even abuse this privilege.

First off, have you ever thought about how much spare time another person has on a day-to-day basis? Many students have a set routine that gives them a plan of what they do everyday. Whether or not that includes chores, time with their family, or even a job that gets them some money. Putting that responsibility on the kids and parents will cause a lot of chaos. This would mean working parents struggling to find a ride for their kid, or even the kids who might already struggle with time management with the stuff they have to do everyday.

Now think back, has anybody, even your parents, ever told you no, that you can't do something?

All children face this answer everyday; It may be about going to their friends house, or asking to stay home from school. Just imagine a pair of very busy parents, or even a single parent, having their kid ask if they can participate in a extracurricular activity. Their first thought could be, "This is going to affect my work schedule and I can't loose anymore money." If they get told no by their parents, while this rule is enforced, it may cause them to get in trouble by their principle or teacher.

Lastly, have you ever hosted or attended an event that a lot of people showed up at? If so, you know there are some people who don't care about anyone else and will cause trouble wherever they go and whenever they want. If that were to happen at a school, and the children who see it go home and tell their parents, the school would get a lot of complaints. After a certain amount of complaints the school would start to be questioned by higher authorities and they may even be looked down upon. Some students will get that type of opportunity and abuse it. They will cause as much mischief and chaos as they can. They may cause fights, be disrespectful to their mentor, or even damage school property.

If you haven't already realized how this decision could affect a school, then hopefully you understand it now. There may be a handful of students that care about participating in school activities or sports. But not every student is that way. Making all the students at a school participate in a extracurricular activity could cause a lot of problems, with the students or parents. This decision would be a big problem because some students may not have the time, they may cause a lot of trouble and are disrespectful, or they may have parents who are too busy for any extra activities.
