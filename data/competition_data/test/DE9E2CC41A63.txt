dear principle , i think that it is not okay for people to always text of use their phone during school . it can be unsafe for those around and those that are texting or calling on their phones. I think that we should have a look out for people that are texting or calling in class. a lot of people one day are all gowing to get caught with their black berrys and smart phones , and by the looks of it ,a lot of people are gowing to get their phones taken away.

i just hope one day that people are gowing to realise that its not safe .

and its not part of the school rules to use a phone at all. its okay touse a cell phone as long as its outside the school campus and not seen by an teacher.

Phones are okay , but not okay when you fake reading and use your iPhone 4 to talk to your friend in class. and usualy in class a guy would be texting
