The world as we know it is quickly and frequently changing. Everything is now digital in at least one aspect. We are in now what one might call the Digital Era. Although the times are changing some things need to stay as analog as possible. An example of this is driving. New technology allows for driverless cars, but this could possibly be one of the most dangerous enhancements that has been created.

The idea of driverless cars has been fancied by visions of the future on televison and movies, but that is where they need to stay. Engineers at Berkeley tried to develop a similar smart car to the one Google has created, but they quickly found out that, "these smat road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was too expensive to be practical,". The upgrades that were needed to help these cars functon were, " electrical cables that sent radio signals to the front end of the car,". These simple adjustments to the roeads could cause cities to purchase the cables, consequently causing that city's government to dig deeper into the taxpayers pockets to pay for them.

Even with the advancements in the driverless car technonlgy, the car can only perform, " at speeds up to 25 mph,". This would the require the driver to still take control of the wheel. This simple fact make the driverless vehicle irrelevant anyway. The whole point of a driverless car is not have to be dependant on humans. With sensors that operate up to a limited speed, " the human driver must remain alert,". Although in support of the driverlass car the question, " why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver," comes up in the article, proving the uselessness of this type of car.

These new cars also could allow for texting and driving, which is one of the number one killers for teen drivers. Driverless cars may have slight warning signs for when the driver has to take over but they can go unrecognized. most traffic laws, " are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times,". In the new cars the human driver is only available for small amounts of time.

All in all, driverless cars are neither needed nor necessary. They are not truky safe and they never will be no matter how many advancements are made to it. The idea of driverlass cars may seem to be the next big thing, but they need to stay in the world of science fiction and never see the light of day.
