Phones & Driving

Now in days, many people know how to use a cell phone and even own a cell phone. Many people tend to use their cell phone while driving and many states have placed in a law that has prohibited cell phone use while operating a vehicle. Yet regardless of the law, many still question if this law should be in place.

I feel that people shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while behind the wheel because it's dangerous overall. Studies have shown that more than 3,000 people have been killed and 416,000 have been seriously injured because of a distracted driver. It has also been proven that cell phones distract a person by 37% while driving, meaning that you aren't as focused on driving and you are more likely to be holding a device with one hand. This limits the maneuverability of your other hand while driving. In 2006 a study was released by the university of utah which said the drivers that use their phones while driving are as dangerous as drunk drivers.

Many states have made a law that bans phone use while driving due to the increased danger. For example, in georgia it's prohibited to even hold a phone while driving. If caught, you could be given a primary offense. But then again, it depends by state and in fact, your insurance can go up if you get a ticket. It ranges from 4 to 30%. Many states like Florida, Tennessee, and 19 other states have a similar law in place. Currently, cell phone tickets don't go down as a dmv point but that might change on January 2021.

There are many stories of horrible accident that happened while using a cell phone and driving. For example, in minnesota a 17 year-old killed a 10 year-old and her father when she ran a red light because she was texting. She is expected to serve 4 years of probation and over 200 hours of community hours. In kansas state university, a 19 year-old died because of a one letter text. And now her older sister educates teenagers on the risks and dangers of texting and driving. In reality, these drivers aren't just putting their life in danger but they are putting others in danger too.

With all this information, I stick with my decision that people shouldn't be able to use their phone and drive. It's just a very dangerous decision. And even though there's a law in place to help improve this problem, people still tend to ignore it. They're putting everyone, including themselves, in danger. Innocent people shouldn't be in danger and it's not just grown ups but little children. Nobody should be in danger over something that can wait. I feel like people should just follow the law because it's only for their safety and everyone else'
