Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service should not be required. It should stay optional to those who have the time to actually do the things that will help. Some people are too busy or feel as if they don't get enough free time. Others just want to have time for themselves without any stress. They shouldn't be required to do something they either don't want to or don't have time to do. For example, someone might have to work on a project that is due in a few days. They need all the time they can get to finish it on time and get a good grade, meaning they don't have an opportunity to go outside and do some work. However, I do think people should take into consideration the fact that helping your community in a positive way makes you a better person. If you have a lot of extra time to do anything you want, you might want to do community service.

If students were required to do community service, you might see some do it half-heartedly. They won't really enjoy it, and they might even mess some things up. It would be more of a job than service. The people who don't want to do it will be more likely to do something that gets them out of it, like skipping or leaving early. They might accidentally or intentionally harm or insult people who do like working for community service. They could encourage people who do it willingly to stop.

To people who do work with good intentions, there should be some kind of reward for their efforts, like a small treat, such as a piece of candy. That alone would help people see they are doing a good job by the fact that they are getting a little compensation. Now I know it's called community service because you are helping the community out of the kindness of your heart, but it would encourage them and make them feel good about doing it. They would bring friends and family to help them, people who wouldn't normally want to do it.

Thank you,
