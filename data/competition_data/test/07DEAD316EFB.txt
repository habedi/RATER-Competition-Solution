To the Principal,

Sir, I do not believe that the students at the school should be required to participate in community service. Although it would serve as good character building for some, many students simply would not have the time to do the allotted amount. I do believe that it would make a great extra credit opportunity, but it is simply too time consuming to be a requirement. the simple fact is that the average student nowadays has a lot more to do than just school. In this economy many are having to take care of siblings while their parents work so they don't lose their house. While not everyone is unable to do the tasks, I do not believe it is fair to make those who are already stressed work even harder. Perhaps an alternative type of program could be set up, such as a reward for doing a certain amount of volunteer work or points added to a grade, but it should not be required.

Another reason I believe community service should not be required is because if it is required, it somewhat loses the character building aspect. Instead of feeling proud for volunteering to help out, students would more than likely resent being forced into the work. they would more than likely not work as hard and just finish the job just for the purpose of finishing it, rather than being happy to help the community and working as hard as they can. All in all I believe that community service should be kept as volunteer work, and not be required.

Sincerely,

A Student at Your School
