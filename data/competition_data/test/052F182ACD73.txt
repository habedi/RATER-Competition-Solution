Dear Principal,

I think that making students do community service is a good thing, everyone should do community service wither it is cleaning up litter in there neighborhood or helping the elderly. Community service also looks really good on a collage application. I am actually trying to help out at the animal shelter, I feel so sorry for the poor dogs and cats that were neglected and are now trying to find a loving home.

I don't think it matters what they do but as long as the students do something to make our community a better place to live. The students don't have to do much to do community service, all it takes is a little time and they can help many people, and even improve the look of the neighborhood. Or if the students want they can do a lot more then just picking up litter off the road and parks, they could do something more challenging like helping out at a pre school or elementary school.

Thank you for reading my letter to you and I hope that you take in consideration to what I have mentioned in the letter.
