"Sorry Generic_Name, I wont be able to go to the concert, I have to finish doing the summer reading project and its due by next week." Imagine having to do a summer project on a beautiful sunny day,I know it seems horrible. Most of us can agree that summer projects have interrupted something pretty interesting. When it happens to me it makes me feel like a flower in need of water, all sad and gloomy. "Why do we have to read out of this list all these books, they are all

BORING." Generic_Name exclaimed. Its always hard to understand why we need to read out of a curtain list and have so much requirements .But we can only imagine how much of a ciaos it would be if everyone was to pick a different level of books ,some challenging and some below their standard level of reading. Although students can make a project of their own its always better to have something organized by a teacher ,in my opinion it sets a more serious setting in the students minds. I believe that teachers should design the summer reading project because it avoids confusion,is more organized and it shows the way the class will be taught in the upcoming year.

In our lives most of us can agree that we have a felt some sort of confusion while completing a task. Thats the reason why I believe teachers should design the summer project that way Its simply to avoid confusion. We all know teachers have more experience in making things sound a lot more simple. They could make a confusing paper full of instructions very simple for students to understand. Students could always contact them via email or by Google classroom for more clarification. As a student I have been stuck and confused many times and by experience I can say that contacting a teacher always helps me. For example last summer I didn't understand what types of connections I had to make in relation to the book that was assigned to me. In that moment,I thought to ask the person who assigned the assignment , I quickly sent my teacher an email and she replied with a more clear and helpful paragraph.

Another reason why I agree that teachers should design the project is because everything would be more organized. Although students could make the assignment a lot more fun I believe it would not be organized .Teachers could make a packet and ask for specific things that are more beneficial for students to look over. Some of those things could be main topics that will be taught during the year. Since a teacher is far more experienced then a student at knowing methods to reach success, teachers could design the project to be more efficient for the students learning. That could mean picking from a curtain verity of books ,the type of genre, or the type of reflections that the teacher wants the class to focus on.

Summer projects can always be a good way to dive in to the new school year .With a summer project many things can be set clear, Like the way the class will be taught. This way the student can realize and understand if they will be struggling and that also makes it clear to the students on what they need to focus on studying. Its basically a good way to introduce the class to things they will be taught during the year. Although teachers are good at making a very well strong structured project students could make the project a little more fun and interesting. Its always fun to see the creations that students have in mind. Instead of having a boring lesson a student could have a way to reach the attention of the students. Overall Making the class be more engaged in what they must learn to be successful.

Many teachers often find summer as a break line in the students learning. Here in Virginia the summer vacation is about 3 months without the teachers assigning a project the students would not mind touching a book. Summer projects are really not for the teachers sake its for the good of the students. I believe teachers should design the project because its a way of keeping things organized ,and structured in a way that is not only beneficial to the teachers but also beneficial for the students.
