Summer projects are a good way for students to learn and retain information for the upcoming school year. It lets the teachers know that the students took the time out of their summer and learn material. Summer projects are usually teacher-designed however, I believe that student-designed projects are more beneficial. By letting students design their own projects the student will have better time management, skill set, and self-esteem.

To begin with, if a student were to designed their own projects they would have better time management. In order for the project to be beneficial, the students will have to prepare everything. For example, if I was given an assignment by a teacher, I would wait until the last minute to complete it. However, if I had to design my own project I will have to do it on a time schedule. When a student is required to design something, they will take their time to make sure everything is right. That is not the case if they wait last minute. If a student designed something they want everything to be perfect and presentable. When a student has better time management, they will be able to improve their skills.

Letting students design their own projects will allow them to sharpen their own skills. I believe that if students are allowed to design their own project, they would learn more. The students will have to take the time to do the research on the topic before completing the task. They would learn from their mistakes and try to understand where they went wrong to fix it. Also, if a student were to design their own project they would be able to think outside the box and enhance their knowledge on the topic. For instance, if a student were to design a project about Generic_City, they would be able to do an in-depth research about it and learn more than if a teacher were to gather questions from an online textbook. The student will also improve organizational skills. By organizing the project they would put more time and effort into it to make sure everything is correct. When a student has organized their project, complete it, and have a better understanding, they would have a higher self-esteem.

When a student has a better understanding on a topic, their self-esteem will improve. The student would be able to appreciate the hard work I have done to get me to where I am a. If a student did not have a grasp on the topic before, but now have an understanding, their confidence will be boosted. For example, if I was to be asked if I understand triangles in eleventh grade the first time we learned it I would not be confident in myself. However, if I took the time during the summer and do research on it and finally grasp the concept, I would be more confident when it is time to take quizzes and tests. Consequently, if a student is not really confident on a topic they might have a negative attitude on the matter. They might have a fixed mindset and think that if they did not get it the first time, they will not get it the second time. By having a fixed mindset, the student will probably not care and avoid the subject. However, if a student truly wants to get better they will grow out of that mindset and learn.

All in all, students that designs their own projects are receiving more benefits. The student's time management will be better. They would have expanded and improved their knowledge on topics. Also they will have better confidence when doing something. When the students come back from break they will be ready to go the old material and learn new material.
