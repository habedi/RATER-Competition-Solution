I am against the development of these cars in the article, ¨Driverless Cars Are Comming¨, because they could be dangerous. I say this because the driver has to stay alert and ready to take over the vehicle if a situation pops up. Yes, there are postive aspects to this article such as: the driver would not have to drive unless needed, it could drive the driver if they are tired (but they must stay awake), the car steers, accelerates, and brakes itself, and it displays heads-up warnings like the vibration of the seat when it is going to hit something. But hose positive things could turn ito disasters quickly. In these disasters i am about to explain the driver coould be hurt, killed, or have a lot of dept due to car dammage.

One of the many disasters that came to mind when i read this article were, the driver getting hurt or critically injured, have lots of dept due to car dammage, or even death. I say this because it is true; these things could happen. One of the examples i thought of is the situation a am about to explain. So here is the situation: The driver got tried, so they set the car to auto drive. The car taakes over and the driver is still awake. Doesn´t sound like a bad situation so far does it? The driver´s eyes start to droop, the driver tries hard not to fall asleep but fatigue wins the fight. The car does not relize this yet and it keeps driving. Then the car senses two crashes have occured just down their road. The car vibrates the seat but the driver is out light a light bulb. The car then goes for the next displaication of giving the driver a heads-up by turning the flashing lights on the windshield. Nothing. The driver is still fast asleep. The car tries all the displays to try to get the driver awake and alert again but to great avail, the driver does not wake up. The car cannot brake yet because it is not near the accidents yet; so it keeps driving.

The car then senses the accidents and breaks; but the car starts to spin out of control of black ice. It had been snowing for weeks there and it had rained the night before and it all froze. The car goes spinning out of control towards the river near the accidents. Then the worst thing happened. The car and the driver went diving into the ice cold river. The driver finally wakes up only to scream with terror right before they hit the water. The driver? head hit the stearing wheel with such an impact that it nocked them out cold. The car sunk deeper and deeper till it hit the river´s bottom. People are above them watching in terror with horrified expressions upon their faces. Some are calling for help, but the help that was there for the people in those accidents had already left. The others are just frozen with terror, unable to move.

The car begins to fill with water slowly, the water is trinkling into the car in every crack it can find. The driver still knocked out does not expect this to be thier last day to be alive, to see thier family and friends, or take a breath of air; but it is. The windows begin to crack from the pressure of the water. Up above them on the road help finally arrives, but it is only the fire rescue and the police. They do not have the right tools to go into frigid water and smash the window open or get the door to open, unbuckle the driver and break to the top of the river´s frigid waters.

The people then see small bubbles, then they become bigger and more faster to break the surface of the water. The car´s windows broke inward and the driver is dead within minutes. later the right toos were brought to the place of the new accident and they bring the car up with the dead driver inside. The driver was a huspand that had just came home from the military and was going to visit his wife and kids as a surprize. Now the family gets to see thier huspand and dad; but he is laying on a table. His skin ice cold to the touch. He is bloated some from the water, he is bruised, bones are broken, and he is dead.

I do not think that anyone who read a story like that in a newspaper or in a book would want a driverless car to be made. Anyone that has a heart would see the dangers in a driverless car coming into this world. This is why i am against the article, ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨.
