I think that this policy will make kids that want to play sports be forced to get better grades & keep a higher average which will be better for the school & the children that are in the school that play sports. A few supporting details are that this new policy will help the school have more activities because if a school has a good overall average then the government will be more willing to give them resources & it would make parents have more faith in school & the parents will know that they're sending their kids to a good school that will insure that they get good grades. It would also reflect to the community how good the school is & how they make sure that your kids will get better grades.

But this policy still isn't perfect because it says in the article that the majority of kids in the school have a C average and if they want people that are playing sports to have a B average there should be a way to help kids with a C average get better grades so they can play sports.

My conclusion is that this policy is a good way to make kids get better grades if they want to play sports but there should be a way that will help the kids with a C average to get a B average so they can play sports
