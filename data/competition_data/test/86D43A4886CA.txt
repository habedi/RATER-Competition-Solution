The author suggest that we study Venus because if we study Venus alot then one day we could possibly get a probe or even humans up there on Venus. That one day we might be able to get close enough to take a sample of rock,gas or anything else. Even though there are risk,like the author states,we can get through the challenges and still get the information we need about Venus.

The text states,a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere(3).The text also states,on the planet's suface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.(3)

In conclusion, if we study hard enough about venus and work around the challenges then one day we could get some answers. We can also finally get samples of rocks,gases, or other thing on venus by the help of a probe that can get close enough to the planet. We could also study more and more about the dangers of the planet to get humans on the planet to see if Venus is livable for humans.
