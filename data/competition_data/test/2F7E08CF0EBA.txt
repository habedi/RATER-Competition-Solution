"Mrs. Generic_Name, I didn't finish my homework last night. I was with the marching band all day," said Generic_Name. "I'm sorry Generic_Name, but I have to give you detention," said Mrs. Generic_Name. Many students want to complete their homework and earn good grades, but extracurricular activities make it very difficult to successfully finish all the work given in a day. Clubs and sports do help students connect with each other, but sometimes at the cost of thoroughly completed homework. Also, this rule would increase the need of after school bus drivers, if all the kids in our school joined a club, transportation home would be a necessity, and many bus drivers would be busy with elementary schools.Â I do not agree that the principal should force us to join an extracurricular activity because students will barely have time to see their families, homework and projects will rarely be completed, and students might not have any interests.

Students are forced to wake up early to get on a bus for school and return home at around 4:00 pm, if we had to do extracurricular activities many students who live far away would not be able to get home until very late in the afternoon. When I get home after school I get to see my mom, my sister, and my dog, Scout, but my sister occasionally stays at school to do Mock Trial, a club for future lawyers, when she gets back she is worn out and usually needs to take a nap. With all the effort that goes into school many students do not have time to socialize with friends or even family. The implication of these clubs would, without a doubt, lower the morale of our school by keeping us away from our homes.

With the long hours of school, the seemingly infinite amount of homework, and clubs, some people find it impossible to stay on top of everything. For example, participating in sports clubs forces you to stay after school for hours and ride the activity bus home to do more work from the school. Some believe that it is easy to continually do your work and keep good grades. For instance, my sister is a perfect, yet rare, example of clubs benefiting students. My sister is a courageous, hardworking student who always finishes her work, unfortunately she is not like many students; some students already do not do their work, and with the addition of mandatory clubs, I believe, the grade point average of Generic_School will drop significantly.

Many people like to relax after they finish their work, maybe read a book, watch television, or take a nap; these are all things that are predominately done at home, in the safety of our rooms. Though there are a wide of assortment of clubs at Generic_School, some students, like myself, find that nothing suits them. The choice of having fun or to getting good grades is a very difficult one, sadly, too many students in our school have already picked the former. Many of my friends that have joined clubs, only joined because their friends told them to. Sports teams are by far the most tried out for, but students join them simply to become popular or well liked, not because they have a real interest. This, of course, is not something we can judge, but something that gives us an insight to why students join clubs. Many adults enroll their children in clubs to give them a place to express themselves, but instead clubs assist in the build up stress, anxiety, and in rare cases, depression.

"Ahhh," Generic_Name sighed, as he relaxed on his sofa reading his book, as comfortable as he could be. Extracurricular activities are the reason some students are incapable of completing work. In contrast, students who are able to take their time and finish their work are the students who have enough time to correctly and carefully do so. Also, extracurricular clubs create separation between groups, clubs like the gaming club and the football team are on different ends of the extracurricular spectrum, making a social divide between them. In conclusion, I do not believe students should have to participate in any form of extracurricular activity because it will cause them to be distant and antisocial, give them less time to complete work for school, and they might not have any interests in school based clubs.
