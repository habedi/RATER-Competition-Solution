Texting While Whipping . .

Driving a car doesn't take that much IQ but then you couldn't say that because why would there be so many crashes per minute. No, driving is hard if you're bad at concentrating on more than one thing. Driving is a whole nether set of skills and it's not as easy but then knowing that your bad at one thing collides with your crazy fast texting skills makes you comfortable doing something dumb like texting and driving. That doesn't really level out with your driving skills but not everyone knows that! But then your mom texts you while you're switching lanes on i85 then BAM! You find yourself playing bumper cars at 79mph barely ending it all! Driving while texting isn't good for everybody but it certainly ant for everyone!

Some of these newer cars have addressed the fully automated phone utilizing Siri or even Alexa! This is probably one of the best things cars now days have to offer. Say you're driving and your mom text you, instead of playing bumper cars you could just tell your car what to reply back to mother! It's actual against the law not to have that feature in your car, not really but it should be. When you are doing your driving focusing is a level you have to raise the bar in and the more help you get on avoiding distractions the better.

Driving while texting is very, dangerous, bad, stupid, fun, and life threating! Being fun because we like to get that rush of sending a whole paragraph while still not playing bumper cars with other drivers on the road. Getting that excitement that you were texting and driving and totally avoided a bad accident or even someone's specific instruction that told you texting and driving was bad gives some people a little additive rush! However, just because you got away with it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, who's to say you won't get away with it on Sunday?

More than 50% of car deaths comes from distractions and more than 50% of those distractions comes from cell phones. Cell phones are nice to have but not while driving. Driving should have a way for you to put your phone down in a slot just for you to start driving. It is very dangerous and you could be risking your life and others as well around you. Driving with your phone out isn't good but when your eye sight goes to your phone instead of the road there is almost always something bad on the verge.

When on the road your attention has to be there as well! You have to understand that you're not the only one on the road and that individuals with families and kids that enjoy living want to keep living. When it's hard enough to concentrate on the road it gets 10 times harder to do so when having another screen in front of you. If you get caught with a phone in your hand while driving by and police officer they should react the same way as if your seatbelt were off! Safety and living will always come first. Phones are not needed at the wheel, your attention is!
