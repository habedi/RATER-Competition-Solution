Dear Principal,

In my opinion I say that Policy 1 is a whole better than Policy 2. Why? Well because if were allowed to use our cell phones during any free time or lunch it would make maybe stop us from using our phones in class because you will already be giving us a little bit of fun, and also because we are teenagers what fun can we have in school if we cant use our phones. Most of the time we don't even use them to text with, we also use them to play games or even listen to music or take pictures. What I'm trying to say is that if we are able to use our phones during free time and lunch and have them turned of during school it would be better instead of having to take away cell phones away from a student everything time they get caught for using a cell phone.

All the student will be glad to have Policy 1 just for the fact that we will have time to use our phones during school and I'm sure students will like school a little more. Hopefully the students will not take advantage of the policy. Just think about we will have fun during lunch and pay attention in class, because when we are using our phones in class we don't pay attention because we are to busy texting or making sure we don't get caught using our phones. And if you feel that you are giving us to much freedom then we cant have our phones on high volume or just give a certain amount of time to use our phone during school, we will be glad to be using our phones. So hopefully you think of the students and make the cell phone policy a whole lot better.
