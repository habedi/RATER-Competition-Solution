Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I agree with your decision on making the school body perform community service because sometimes in life there are things that you are not going to always want to do or agree with, however we still have to do it. As children, if we do not learn to make those wise decisions on our own then that may corrupt our future.

For an example, what if you decided to always let us have our way and we got use to that. Once we became an adult and get a good education, life is not going to be that simple. Like the saying "What ever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger".

By doing something we do not chose to do wont hurt you, it makes you grow and become a bigger person. However, learning this method doesn't occur over night. It takes time and a lot of "Laying down the law".

Most parents do not teach this to their children, so who will? As their principal it is your duty to teach them the right and wrong ways in life. Some children look up to their principals, so wouldn't you want to be a good example for them? Even when you make bright decisions like these, they will not always understand and become furious with you. However little do they know you are helping them and at the end your hard work will pay off.

In conclusion some ideas are worth it, maybe not in the beginning but at the end they show not only the children's success but your as well.

Once they grow up and walk across that stage they will indeed thank you and you will then realize it for yours
