Dear Principal,

I think that students should not be required to perform community service because it should be their choice if they want to do it or not. Community service should be done when someone voluntarily wants to do it. Some people may like to do it while others may not. However, there are some students who are too busy to do any community service work. It shouldn't be a requirement. It should be a choice.

Community service is a great thing to do and its very kind, but there may be some students who do not like to do community service. They could be too busy to do it or they just might not want to do it. There are some students who do community service already. Other students might just think community service is lame and don't want to do it. Nothing is wrong with that. It's just how some people are and we shouldn't try to force them to do something that they don't want to do.

Some students are just too busy with school and trying to keep their grades up that they don't do community service. They also may be involved in other clubs and in other groups that keep them busy so they may not be able to do community service. Another thing that may keep students from doing community service is their families. Some students may have responsibilities that they owe to their families that keep them from being able to do community service. Students have lives outside of school and this may not be the way they want to spend it.

There are some students who already do community service, as I have mentioned before. They may be learning important lessons by doing community service. It may be something they choose to do rather than something they are forced to do. However, they might be doing it only because another group they are involved in may be forcing them to do it. For example, my older cousin had to do community service for her hula halau. They forced her to do it and she did. Other groups that kids may be involved in may require them to do community service as well.

School should be a place where kids come to learn and to gain valuable life skills. We should not be forced to do community service. Although, I do believe it is a great thing, I don't believe we should be forced to do it. School is a place where we learn to gain social skills and academic skills. Community service only benefits the community and not the person doing it. So, I believe that we should not be forced to do it. It should be a choice and not a requirement.
