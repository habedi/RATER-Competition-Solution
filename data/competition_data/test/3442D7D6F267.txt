I believe this could be valuable in classrooms because now in days students use a lot of computers for work. The possiblities this could open up are huge, like making learning more fun for each student and making them enjoy learning. It could also take away advantages and give each student an equal oppertunity to learn and succed.

Lets face the fact, teachers can't make learning fun for every student. But this computer software can. It can use the information about whether your bored or not as stated in the article "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This could adjust to a students particuler need and make learning more effective and fun for students. By molding to each students particuler way of learning and interests, it could make learning easy.

How this could make learning more fun exactly is it can read your emotion and change how it approaches teaching you, untill it finds your not as confused or bored as stated in the article "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." Eventually it could make it to where each student is enjoying how it is teaching them and they can become more interested and interactive with there learning and studing. If every student had this they could all enjoy learning and studing and it could give each student equal oppertunities to learn and be as smart as possible, one day maybe ending people not graduating.

In conclusion if we had this in school today we would see a giant difference in the amount of students at school and the test scores would blow our current scores out of the water. Why, simply because it would make learning fun for every student not just a handfull, it could make things fair for each student and making learning less a chore rather a hobby.
