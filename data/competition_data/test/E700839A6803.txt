Should students in your school be required to perform community service? Well, i think they do.

Even if you don't know what to help with there are so many things that people in the school that needs help. What if you wanted help? Not a lot of people want to do recycling, tutor, even though you don't want to do those things, they still have to be done. helping people might also interfere with your favorite show, or the sports you play, but would you want to look back and be happy that you did something productive?

Everyone needs to think about that sentence, would you be happy if you helped any other person or would you think about, but that takes time, or i don't feel like it. Not everybody thinks about if you help somebody then you can change a life. For a lot of people that is good enough for some of them.

The main reason why teenagers need to help people now, is so they can know it better in the future. And if you help someone you aren't only going to make them feel better, you might feel better for doing something right. Kids have to realized that they have something not everybody has, some kids don't have two parents living with them, some don't have phones that they can afford, and I think that is something that people should understand.

At this school, we do have those things like tutorial time, but that is optional and not everybody uses their time doing what they should be. Sometimes everybody makes the wrong decision, but that shouldn't be the case for someone not to help someone in need. So it is a good thing to help in community services, and kids should be recognized for things they do to help in a positive way.

Whether the next time you don't want to do something is it worth to leave it alone? Or will you try to help in make it better in the way that can help the community. If you don't want to do something, like do the laundry, or do the dishes, or take out the trash, just realized that you are just making another life a lot more better. I hope that you realize that whatever you want to do is not always the right thing to do. And do something because you know that is right. Everything is a choice, and based on it is how you react to it, help your community.
