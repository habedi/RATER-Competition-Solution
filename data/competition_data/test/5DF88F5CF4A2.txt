I do not think that diverless cars should be a thing. It allows drivers to not pay attention. They could cause more acciddents. The driver might not feel or see when the car is trying to get them to pay attention because it needs human feautures. I believe that driverless cars should not happen.

If somebody had a driverless car they would probably not be paying attention at all. They could be on their phone the whole time or who knows maybe even taking a nap. If the car needs them for their human features and their not paying attention then most likely they won't be able to assist the car with their human features.

Diverless cars could cause more accidents. The car could have a malfunction and go crazy. If they need the human features and the human isn't paying attention then that cauld cause an accident. I think driverless cars are a really bad idea. The risks of them causing more accidents are very high; and the risk of the human not paying attention is very high also.

In my opinion I think driverless cars are not good for the safety of other humans. I think that driverless cars will be more harmful to all of us. Diverless cars have so many hazards that everybody needs to be aware of. Maybe if they work out some of the kinks, like it needing human features; then maybe it wouldn't be so bad. As of now though I think that they are a really bad idea.
