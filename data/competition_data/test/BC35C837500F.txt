I believe that in this passage Luke becomes a seagoing cowboy and travels all over the seas and Luke really wanted to see China and Europe, Luke takes trips all over and thye author of the story chose Luke and showed us what Luke did as a seagoing cowboy. Evidence from the passage to support my answer is the author talked about what Luke did as a seagoing cowboy. Another peice of evidence from the story to support my conclusion is it was World War II and it happened in Europe duing that time so Luke helped his friend out and helped him with saving people with food and money and also, a shelter. These peices of evidence supports my conclusion by being stated in the text.
