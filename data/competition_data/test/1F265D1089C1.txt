Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I honestly think all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME should have too participate in collecting community service hours. I think that because our community needs things done and kids could get fit while helping the community. Plus its like a bonus because the community and the students get something in return. While the community is improving the students are getting community service hours. For example the community has a lot of trash and other objects needing too be cleaned up. If the trash is cleaned up then maybe it could even reduce some of the pollution in our community.

They could also help by helping kids in elementary with what their seeking help in. That would Increase the community's education level. It would also keep some kids out of trouble. Instead of kids getting into trouble and wasting there time they could be helping the community out, and getting community service hours. They also wouldn't be wasting there time because their helping the community they live in out.
