Technology is seeming to make a break through almost every day as we can now use a computer to tell us how we're feeling. This could help us in many ways as to avoid miscommunicatiom often seen in classrooms and help teachers understand their students better. Let me show my thought process on why this new technology should be used in schools.

As said in the passage "Most human communication is nonverbal, ,including emotional communcation." This shows that having another source to either confirm or challenge your preception of what a student is feeling can help when dealing with situations that need clear communication. Many problems occur through miscommunication and this new technology can help us disyper what a student is feeling. This will allow for us to create a better atmoshpere in which students will feel understood and supported.

While people may say this could be an intrustion of their privacy as many students don't want people to know thier feelings and may feel exposed and as if they wouldn't have any privacy. " We humans perform this same impressive "calculation" everyday" this new technolgy is only helping us prove what we may already know as we can tell by looking at a face what feeling they're most likley feeling. Studies have shown that adults and teenagers use differnt parts of the brain to figure out what a person is feeling and casues huge miscommunication as they both may precieve a different emotion on eachothers face.

These are the reason why I believe that this new technology can be useful in schools by clearing up a lot of nonverbal communcation.
