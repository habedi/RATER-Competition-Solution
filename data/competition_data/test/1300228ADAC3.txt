Dear, school principals

I believe students should be able to bring cell phones to school. Students should be allowed to bring them during lunch periods. We as students understand we should not bring them to class. So we should bring them during lunch because, it would be less of a distraction. When you are in class the cell phone could be on silent so it will be less of a distraction to other students. Cell phones could go off but it wouldn't be as loud on silent. Also, if the cell phone makes a sound and distracts you, we can turn them off. If we turn off our cells phones then you wouldn't have anything to worry about. Therefore you would not have to take our phones, or you could give us another chance and just silence before you start to take our phone away.

When you take our phones away, we probably will try to take it back somehow. If we try to take them back you could give us a detention. Or if we take them back you could give us a warning about not to do it again, then after three warnings you could call our parents then if they agree to detention, or any sort of punishment, then you give it to us. Also, when you don't know how to read a clock you could check you're cell phone, or ask the teacher, even though it could be embarrassing at times.
