So your principal is making your whole school do an extracurricular activity. You haven't chosen which activity that you want to do. So then your principal chooses for you and you really hate the activity that your principal gave you. How would you feel if your principal gave you an activity that you didn't like? Would you just go with it or would you try to get out of the activity?

I agree with the principal because I feel that it is important that kids do extracurricular activity for school. Most kids don't do sports or a extracurricular activity after school because they are to lazy to actually do something active. The average kid after school and when they get home will start watching videos on their phone or they will get right on video games. Extracurricular activities could help students make new friends or the activity could be a learning experience. Say you just moved to a new school and your new school is making you do a extracurricular activity. The extracurricular activity could be a good way for you to make a friend at your new school. Some people might not like doing the extracurricular activity that they choose because they think it is a waste of time, but in the long run they might actually enjoy doing the activity after a while. The activity that the student has chose may not be fun at first but they might start to like it overtime. Extracurricular activities may be more fun for others but overall your getting out of your house and being active and not being a couch potato.

Some extracurricular activity maybe more interesting then others like you might have robotics club and your friend has homework club. They both have different benefits like robotics you get to build things like robots, moving vehicles, and stuff out of legos that you can program. Benefit of homework club is that if you need help with a certain part of your homework someone at school could help you. When you get home you don't have any homework so if you like playing video games you are able to play video games when you home without having to worry about having homework that is due tomorrow. Some students when they get home from school don't do anything, but with the extracurricular program that your school is doing. The students will have something else to do after school instead of just hanging out at home doing nothing. With extracurricular activities going on you have more time to hangout with your friends, but when you are at home the only way for you to communicate with your friends is through Facetime, a phone call, or through text. People that do after school clubs have a better chance of actually trying something new then someone who doesn't do after school extracurricular activity because when you do after school activity or club you are trying something new that you might not have ever tried before. Say you join robotics you are trying something new and trying new things will then make you want to try other new things like other clubs or activities.

Some people might already be busy or doing other activities outside of school. So they might not have time for a school extracurricular activity because they maybe doing a sport and then when they get home they have to do homework then by the time all that stuff is done they have to eat dinner, shower, then go to bed. So a school extracurricular activity maybe to much stuff for that one person to do. What if a student doesn't have a ride home or their parents won't be there in time to pick up the student. The student will just be at school even longer if there parent isn't able to pick then up in time.

Some student may not have time for school after activities because they might have other activities that are more important then school activities. People that have activities might not have them everyday so they could go to the after school activities the days they don't have there sports practice going on or other clubs that aren't related to school.

Even if you have a sport going on you could still try to find time to at least do the extracurricular activity once a week, but if you want to do an after school activity and your sport that great but the principal shouldn't be in charge of what you do after school because the principal is only in charge of you in till that last bell rings for dismissal.

The principal made it where everyone has to do at least one extracurricular activity. Most the students like that the principal did that but some students are mad that the principal is doing that because some students don't want to be at school any longer then they already have to and some students like having free time after school. Having to do extracurricular activity can be boring for some, but fun for some people. I feel like the extracurricular activity after school would be a good idea for schools to do. So they have more active students instead of having a student that just don't want to do anything and just want to go home and watching videos and be a couch potato. The program would be a good thing for student but not all student like to active and I feel that if they don't dont want to do the extracurricular activity then I think they shouldn't because when a student doesn't want to the activity then they are just hurting them self by not being active and just being lazy. When a student doesn't want to do the active they are just failing them self because they are choosing to not participate in the activity but when you do participate in your activity that you choose you are being successful because when you start something you should always finish. Overall if you like the activity your doing or not don't complain about it just be happy that you get a chance to have a extracurricular activity. Some kids are unable to because they have to do other things. So be grateful that you get a chance to have a extracurricular activity provided at your school.
