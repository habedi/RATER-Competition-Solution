Students should not be allowed to take distance classes at their schools. Being at home, taking classes on a computer all day is not good for you. There are many problems that occur when you get no social interaction in real life. It is important to make coversations with people in person, the amount of work completed would decrease, and there would not be as many memories made.

The importace of in real life interaction is huge! There is a big difference between talking to someone face to face, and talking to someone over the internet. Many people are not scared to say whatever they want on the internet, while in person they are very timid or hesitant to express themselves. Making students go to school and interact with people helps them slowly break out of their shell and become more willing to talk to people. But if students stay at home and take classes and never talk to people, it would be nearly impossible to break out of that shell.

The amount of work that is completed and turned in would drop dramaticly. If you think about it students hardly do their homework, so why would they do classwork at home? They would not and this would lead to a drop in grades. A person that is for the distance classes could say that they could attend class even while they are sick. But even if that is true if they are too sick to go to school they will probably not pay attention to the class thats on their computer.

A big thing they would miss out on is the memories. There are so many times where someone messes up something and the whole class starts laughing, or the teacher assigns a fun class activity that makes the whole day better. You just can not get that same excitment of having fun in person through a computer screen. The worst part would be making zero memories with your friends in school. You can not talk to your friends in between classes and joke around because you would not be in the hallways. You would be behind a screen waitiing for your next class to start which is no fun.

When you think about the importance of social interactions and then think about distance classes it is really a no brainer what the answer is. Students need that interaction in order to develop important skills that they will use for the rest of their lives. So students need to keep going to school and take normal face to face classes.
