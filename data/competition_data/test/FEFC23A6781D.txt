Over the summer some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning during their break. The projects have to be turned in at the beginning of the school year normally for a grade. Since summer projects are meant to keep students on task for the next school term, it is important that the projects are teacher- designed. These assignments being teacher-designed will facilitate a meaningful comprehension of the subject, keep students on task, and challenge students.

Teacher-designed summer projects will create a deeper understanding in students because they will have already seen the material once before relearning it. Being able to look at the material before just diving straight in to a subject yields a higher success rate. For example, if you had a test you would most likely score higher if you were able to review it before hand. This is the same with these projects. When being able to review the material before hand it create a different type of understanding rather than learning it for the first time in class. This allows students to learn on their own pace. Ultimately, this will help the student put the material they are learning into their own words, making it easier to comprehend. Summer projects give the student the bases of the subject. This is why it is important for the projects to be teacher-designed because they know what the curriculum is.

If teachers make the projects it will be the easiest way to know what will be happening in the next school term. This will also help the teacher because all the students are coming in with the same amount of knowledge. During the summer students will be able to stay on task with the curriculum made by the teacher. The structure will help the students in the long run because it provides a way for the students to stay focus. Being able to stay focus is important when it comes to learning because the students will be able to get the most out of the assignments when there is structure and organization. When people have plans they tend to end up being more productive and leaning more. However, when something is not planned they tend to go with the flow which could lead to procrastination and stress. For example, when writing papers it is best to make a plan before you start writing because the organization helps keep you stay focused without stressing.

Students most likely do not want to do these projects. Therefore, if they were able to make them they would cheat themselves from learning. This is why if teachers designed them it will not only challenge the students but help them understand. Since the teacher is the expert in that subject, with them making the projects it will make students strengthen their weaknesses. The only way students can overcome their weaknesses is through practice and repetition. For example, when you do a sport the only way to get better is to practice and challenge yourself or you will be stuck in the same spot forever. Just like athletes the only way students can get better is for them to be challenged. Moreover, the teacher knows what is challenging in that subject so even if the students may not want to do it, it is preparing them for the better.

In summary, teachers being able to design the summer projects will ultimately help the students succeed. Teachers are the master in the subject they teacher, so it makes sense for them to be the one who is making the projects so they can better the students. If they make the assiggnments they will be structured the way the ciruculum is which would help the student not stress and stay on task throughout the summer. Students will be able to come into the new school term prepared for the subject with an understanding that they would not have had if it were the other way, this is crucial for the success of the students. Teacher made projects in all, will be the most beneficial to students whether it be in challenging them, helping them process the material, or keeping them focused.
