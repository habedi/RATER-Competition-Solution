I believe that the use of facial Action Coding System technology is useful because it assisits the students and the teachers so that the students better understand the subject and that the teachers have less work explaining to the students how to do the work.

In the article Ive read that this technology is actually quite complex, considering that this technology can read SIX basic facial expressions meaning that it can tell whether a student is happy, sad, fearful etc. I believe that if this technology is improved and developed to a point where every country in the world uses it, it can one of the most useful piece of technology mankind has ever created.

Ive explained why i think this technology is useful for students across the world and how useful it is also for teachers. Considering that they dont have to explain the work to the students. Hopefuly i can use this tech one day also.
