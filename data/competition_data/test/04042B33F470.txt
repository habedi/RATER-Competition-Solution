Dear principal,

I believe that policy 1 is a better policy because cell phones will keep us busy at times and in the free time we need to still be busy. As long as we don't have them out in class, we should be able to have them, but if any student tries to text or even just have their phone out in class the teacher has every right to take it away. When the teacher takes a phone away she can determine how long she takes it and she can make it were the parents have to come in for the students to get it back. But if we are at lunch the teacher can not take them away. And if we hear about a club or a sport that we want to do while we are at school and if we wait until lunch we could text or call one of our parents so they know about it and we don't have to go down to the front office to borrow that phone.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
