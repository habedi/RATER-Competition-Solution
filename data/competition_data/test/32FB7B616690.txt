My Opinion on Electoral Vote, is that we should have a direct vote with all americans to be able to pick not just other people that are with goverment it is not fair, we vote.. yes? but we don't get anyhting out of it. They say we can vote but that vote never counts, only Electoral Votes do. We are like basically thorwing a vote to nothing.

We should have us Amercians to be able to vote. Not just politicans, it should be the land of the free, not something that is keeping us from changing or helping are country that we think it's right. Well not I like it should be are turn. Over 60 Percent of us Amercians want change in this and I think we should have it, you must be 21 years old or older and it should just be U.S.Citizens only, you have to be born and rasied here.

Popular votes don't even matter now because to be honest there not even counting them. So really what is the point here? Direct vote for U.S. Citizens or have the Goverment choice for you in a way they choose there Politicans. The most votes should be able to have a a goat voting and so on. The Electoral colledge has plenty of problems like, People in there get the wrong Electoral votes mixed up which is a big issue and needs to be fixed right away.

The majority of the Electoral votes are 270 there are 538 electors its required to elect a President each state has an enrollement of which each state can have or obtain pretty much if the state is bigger the Electoral votes proceed to be higher and higher, which isn't excalty fair we wanna go with our own votes etc. We deserve to makeour lifes easier not the goverments or anything like that we are equal and it should stay that way.

The president election is held every 4 years and a big deal and which is a problem is, voters cannot vote for who they want vote for, but the state electors, can make the president and give him this so called power, anyways that's a state issue, change should be here soon but, thats a little of my input on here for which Electoral votes or Directs are right, change will be soon so just keep your hopes up and keep your head up straight.
