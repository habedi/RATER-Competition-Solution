Imagine you are in the middle of a wonderful summer break. When suddenly, you received an email; you opened it, and it happens to be from your teacher. There it is, your summer assignment; after glancing through the rubric document, you let out a big sigh. The requirements and tasks on the rubric were super complex, and it does not interest you whatsoever. You thought to yourself that if this summer project was to be a student-based assignment, then you would enjoy it a lot more. Thus, this lead me to believe that summer projects should be student-designed because it expands students' creativity, give students motivation, and students will have a more likely chance to succeed.

Student-designed projects give students a sense of creativity. Students will be able to express themselves, and show their teacher their fullest potential. Student-designed projects allow students to be more creative through learning by thinking outside of the box. This is because students will have the freedom to go above and beyond their limits, due to the fact that there won't be any certain requirements. Students can also be themselves, and create a final product that meets their teachers' standards. Without realizing it, students can end up creating a masterpiece that they would never have thought they'd be able to create before.

Not only will student-designed projects give students a sense of creativity, but it also give students more motivation. According to

The National Education of Youth Institution , a student stated that he was completely stressed while completing his assignment, which was teacher-designed. Since he did not know what to do for his summer project, this gave him lots of anxiety and stress. This shows that teacher-designed projects will not benefit students, but rather do more harm to the students' health. However with student-based projects, students tend to be more motivated and dedicated to completing their work; as a result, this will provide a positive atmosphere and mindset for students. Motivation is an important concept in learning because it is what strives students to go above and beyond. By having the motivation to complete the assignment, students will have more interest in their activity, and will enjoy it more.

Furthermore, students will have a more likely chance to succeed. Student-based projects will ultimately benefit students because they will be more confident in obtaining a good grade, due to them originally creating the project with their own ideas. A study at Harvard University shows that 86% of students received above an 80%, a B letter grade, on their graded student-designed summer projects. After looking at the statistic, we can conclude that students whom had the opportunity to complete a student-designed assignment, were more likely to succeed and earn a decent grade.

To summarize the totality of the argument, students will have a more beneficial and practical effect when completing a student-designed project rather than a teacher-designed project. Summer assignments should be student-designed because it gives students a sense of creativity, motivate students to do their best, and more students will succeed in the end. Student-designed projects will not only have a big impact on the future of education, but on the students as a whole.Â
