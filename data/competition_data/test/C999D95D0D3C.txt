I thing more people should join in the Seagoing Cowboy program because we get to visit diffrent places and help people out witch always makes me fell better about myself and it makes that person you are working for happy too.

There is also an unbelievable opportunity of a small-town boy, or antone who wants to join and has a little expereance with animals. I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China. I also got to see the Acropolis in Greece witch was realy cool.

Traveling the hight seas was hard sometimes but i got over it. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. But caing for the animals kept me busy, they had to be fed and watered three times a day. But there are also other jobs you could work.

The fun things you could do on board is play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed, but the only way you could play is after you have returning from trips after the animals had been unloaded.

So i hope that after you have read this you are thinking adout wether you should do this or not. I personaly think you should do this because it is sometimes fun and diffrent and not everyone has this opportunity. But make sure that you ask your parents first before you go sailing off without them knowing were you are at or going, that would be bad and you dont want that to happen. I hope to see you here next year.
