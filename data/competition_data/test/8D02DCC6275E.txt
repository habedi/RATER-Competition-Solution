I think kids should be able to use there phones for lunch and other free periods because, instead of sneaking them and getting caught we can have fun and not be so worried about it. We don't do a lot at lunch or in passing periods, so a phone might be a fun and entertaining way to make time fly.

Sometimes we have emergency's and we need our phones to call our parents, because the teacher doesn't always let us use the school phone, and we need to be able to bring our phones to school, for transportation reasons such as we might not know how were getting home, or other reasons like not having lunch money, or needing to stay for tutoring. There are so many different reasons that we need our phones at school, sometimes there might be an after school club that starts that day and you need to make last minute calls to your parents to let them know your going to stay for the meeting. Sometimes we forget our lunch or lunch money at home and we have no way to eat , we would really need to call or text our parents to bring it. If we were allowed to bring our phones to school and use them for our free time, we will respect the fact that we need to turn off the phones during class, and do so.
