My teacher said that "Projects in the summer should be student designed." Students should get to do whatever they wanna do on this project. There should not be any requirements to no project unless the teacher gives out the directions. Summer break projects should be student designed because they can have fun with it, they can come up with different ideas, and do it on their own time. Ideas can lead up to many different outcomes and change what you are in the future. That's why students should be able to do student designed projects.

First, summer student designed projects should be a thing so that students can have fun with it in a way. They can come up with their own ideas and make the project interesting and filled with information. Even if they're having trouble, they can call up a close friend or family member to help them with it too and have fun at the same time. They can even look up the information online if needed. Students should have fun in the summer so that's why they need this.

Second, student school designed projects should happen because a lot of students can come up with different ideas for the project. Like I said before ideas can lead up to different creative ways and get your project done as fast as you can. These ideas can get their projects into school science fairs and stuff like that. Maybe they can learn some new stuff while coming up with ideas for the project. This way, they can keep learning during the summer.

Finally, designed projects for students during the summer should happen because they wouldn't have to rush through it. Summer should be a time for relaxing and not trying to overwork yourself. However students should be able to get some learning in that's why summer school exists. People can go there and get all the learning they want to and get their projects done in a short period of time. They are a perfect way to get time to yourself and get what you need to get done.

i prefer student designed projects over teacher because i'ts just a lot better in common. I like the idea of it and it sounds better you can get information in your mind like you haven't already had. It's sad that some schools don't have this because students need to get some learning in the summer even if its a little. All schools should have it, plus students will be able to thank their teachers and people in the school for doing this so they can have a better future. That's why i like it.
