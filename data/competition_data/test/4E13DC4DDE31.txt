The facial acting coding system that is being used to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can tell exsacaly how somone is feeling rather they are sad or happy just by their facial expressions . In the text its states that the whole process bgins when the computer contructs a 3-D computer mode of face;all 44 major muscles in the mode move like humans muscles. It also staes that six basic emotions was classidied happiness,suprised, anger,disgust,fear,and sadness. It associate with each characteristic movement of the facial muscles during the process your frontalis pars laterails muscles above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you are suprised ,and the orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips to show that you are angery.

They do this by weighting the different units,also the software can identify mixed emotions. It is hard trying to decribe each facial trait that conveys happy or mad so dr huang observed that artists like vindic studies human anatomy to help them piant facial muscles enough to convey specific emotions. His software stores anatiomical information like electronic code the technology can always reconize when a student is bored or confused it also can make computers animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.

I think this technology to read the emotional exspressions of students in your classroom is really valuable because we dont know or have any technology that can read every emotion that you are feeling and that others around you are feeling
