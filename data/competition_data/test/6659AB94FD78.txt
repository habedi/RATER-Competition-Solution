Imagine taking a simple stroll through the neighborhood that you can't even enjoy because of pollution in the air. Limiting the usage of cars has many advantages. Some would even say cars can add unnecessary stress to your life. There's no need to worry about gas money or the cleanliness of your car. There are many perks that can come with not using cars.

Source 1, which is written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, tells us that there are "efforts to drastically reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...". Experts believe that reducing the use of cars will help decrease the percentage of gas emissions. The exhaust from the tailpipes of cars are harmful to the enivronment. We can save and protect our communities by not relying on cars as much as we do.

In Source 3, Andrew Slesky quotes a businessman saying, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." Having cars can cause unecessary problems such as, gas money, oil changes, and simple break downs that cars sometimes have. By using this type transportation less, we can also lower air pollution that's damaging the environment in our communities. By reducing the usage of cars, we can all stress less and enjoy the outdoors like we should be able to.

Source 4, also by Elisabeth Rosenthal, tells us that "transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions." These carbon emissions are very much harmful to the environment. Cars can actually be a danger to our society, and limiting the usage of them will be beneficial to everyone.

Using cars is very helpful for some people, but they are not having the greatest effect on our environment. If we limit the use of cars, people will stress less and the air won't be as polluted. Reducing the usage of transportation will be for the good of most people.
