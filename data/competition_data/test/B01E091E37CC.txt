Dear Mr. Principal,

I think you should require community service for at least half off the school year. Some kids can't afford a tutor so why cant the older teens take hold of the that problem , we have already learned this stuff so why can't you teach it too. It is our responsibility to become the leaders of this nation when our time comes why can't we start young. There is many different things you could do such as volunteer at the local soup kitchen, got to the local homeless shelter and help out there, you just help out in your neighborhood. I think that this should be apart of your final grade. There are some many people out there that needs our help. You can raise money for a family in need because we know the economy is down and here in Michigan there aren't a lot of jobs I know how it feels to go with out but we need to stand up and take hold of this problem. A lot people may only need someone to talk to and if that's what they need then be there for that person. When I see a homeless person in the streets, i seat there and wonder why our community has not done anything. We need to step up and take matter in our own hand. I don't like to see people in pain or hurt or anything. But when other people put that person hurts someone else it makes me madder. Why cant we just suck it up and help other and treat that person with respect not just to get it done. We should be so happy when that person is happy because of what you have done.

Stand up and take responsibly.

Thank you , STUDENT_NAME
