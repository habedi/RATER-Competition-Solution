What would you think if you heard "Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity?" I agree with this prompt because kids wont get in trouble as much Also, Some kids dont have many friends, It can also be a good life trait.

Firstly, Kids make it look like they love being in trouble. If we had an after school activity they liked to do, They would have a reason to stay out of trouble. Generic_Name, was always in trouble in school. Until, The varsity coach asked him to play football for him. In return he would have to stay out if trouble. Now he is making big money to this day because of that extracurricular activity to keep him out of trouble.

Secondly, You know that there is always that one kid that people pick on because he like playing cards. If there was a card tournament or something that he or she could do. Therefore, they could make friends with the same interest as them. Also, They wouldn't be that lonely kid no more! And another thing, There grandparents wont be the only ones winning the cards games anymore.

Lastly, You can also, Learn a good life traits from the activity you choose. What if they have a building club you can become a construction worker. Therefore, They can make some good money to take care of there family. Another thing, what if your good at a sport but, your to scared to try out? Your principal is making you try out, and who knows they could become a NFL player who makes millions!

Conclusion, I agree with the prompt I was given because, kids will have a reason to stay out of trouble Also, Some kids dont make friends easy, It can also be a good life trait to a job. I hope you have enjoyed my paper, have a great day!
