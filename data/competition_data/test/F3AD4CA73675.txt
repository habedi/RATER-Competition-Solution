THE ADVANTAGES IN LIMITING CAR USAGE ARE VERY DRASTIC. IN THIS NEW APPOROACH STORES ARE PLACED A WALK AWAY, ON A MAIN STREET, RATHER THAN IN MALLS ALONG SOME DISTANT HIGHWAY. ANOTHER POSITIVE ON PUTTING LESS TIME IN YOUR CARS IS THAT THE POLLUTION LEVELS WILL DECLINE VERY MUCH SO. CONGESTION ON THE STREETS WENT DOWN BY 60% IN FRANCE AFTER 5 DAYS OF TESTIFYING IN SMOG. "THE SMOG" WHICH IS BEJING,CHINA WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE MOST POLLUTED CITIES IN THE WORLD. WITH LESS PEOPLE AND COMMOTION IT LEFT THE ROADS CAR-FREE AND DEVOID OF TRAFFIC JAMS. THE MAIN GOAL ON PEOPLE USING LESS OF THERE CARS IS TOO PROMOTE ANOTHER WAY OF TRANSPORTATION INSTEAD OF SOMEBODY USING THIER CAR.

IF PEOPLE WERE TOO USE LESS CARS THAN IT WOULD BE A GOOD OPPURTUNITY TO TAKE AWAY STRESS AND LOWER AIR POLLUTION. IF PEOPLE USED THERE CARS LESS THAN THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE TO CREATE A PLACE FOR THE PEOPLE TO BE SAFE ON WHICH MEANS MORE SIDEWALKS FOR THE KIDS AND ADULTS THAT WOULD BE USING THEM. RUSH HOUR WOULD BE NO PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE LESS PEOPLE ON THE ROADS BESIDES ALL THE TAXIS AND BUSES. RESTURANTS WOULD BE INPACTED GREATLY BECAUSE ALOT MORE PEOPLE WOULD STOP ON THERE WAY HOME FROM THE JOB TO GET A BITE TO EAT. IF THE POPULATION KEEPS GROWING THAN THAT MEANS THE POLLUTION WILL TOO AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE A STOP AND BETTER THIS EARTH BEACUSE BEFORE WE KNOW IT WE WILL BE BREATHING IN TOXIC GASES AND DYING! SO HELP SAVE THE EARTH AND DRIVE LESS IN YOUR CARS PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF US ALL!
