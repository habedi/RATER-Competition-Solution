Community service is important and I think that you should have everyone in our school do at least a couple of hours of community service as a all year project. For some students community service is a big deal because they will say i don't want to do this its a waste of time. I don't think that. Community service is something that will make you feel good after your done because your doing something that gives nothing in return. My brother has gone and done community service at OTHER_NAME. which is a store that people take used things that are in good shape and the people at the store sell them for cheap. this helps family's in need get things they need. I think that the students at our school could go to places like OTHER_NAME and help out. The students would only have to do a couple of hours work there and it would help people out a lot. Who knows maybe if the students at our school do some community service it might help them to become better people. I think when its time for the projects to be done maybe the students could write a paper about how the community service affected them and the people they worked for. If students do that paper maybe they should get a little incentive party after words because of all there hard work. all in all I really hope that you decide to have the students of our school do community service because I think we can all benefit from it.
