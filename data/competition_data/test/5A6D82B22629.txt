I think that driverless cars could be very very dangerous and could cause lots of harm among the people on the road. i feel as if people would get to comfortable in the cars and wouldnt really pay attention to the surrounding traffic pedestrians or other roadblocks then you have to think of all the other possibilities and the consequences and all the legal fees and laws for anyone hurt.

the car companies are trying to have the people in the cars always have their hands on the wheel but people would end up taking advantage of their new found freedom in the car and it could turn into bad horrible disasters the cars are able to drive and what not but they cant navagate through difficult things the cars are also supposed to have heads up displays but i find that, that could prove to be a terrible decision in the endbecause if people get to comfortable they may end up sleeping at the wheel not tpaying attention or just being dumb.

so thats why i think we shouldnt have driverless cars becuase i dont think that everyone would use the cars as safely as the manufactorers wanted them to be used. Then you have to factor in the driving of people without the driverless cars will the driverless cars be able to react quick enough if the other people are driving eradically we dont know yet and thats what could cause lots of problems legally with the companies and individuals.
