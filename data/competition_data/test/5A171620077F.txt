The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because some computers can give you wrong information. you cant always rely on a software. In Paragraph 7 , it says " your PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. but we can write down some simple instructions that "encode" different emotions, i really think technology is doing the work for us.

We need to take time and do it ourselves and expressing our own feelings because sometimes when you actually happy you got a natural mean mug. The software is going to get the wrong information when it tries to figure out our feelings. moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. making faces cant reveal so much about the science of emotions. You gonna spend your money on something that might get your feelings wrong . That will be the waste of your money.
