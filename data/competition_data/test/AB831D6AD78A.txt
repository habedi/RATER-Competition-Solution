Once a year Summer break comes around, the time of year every student is looking forwards too from the moment it end till the minute it begins. Yet some schools believe that their students need to continue to study, and learn over this long break. Summer is a time that has always been advertised as a time to go on vacation and put down all the books for a series of weeks to have fun. Yet for some students this isn't an option some teachers assign rigorous assignments for students to complete which can completely control and ruin theirÂ time off. By having students plan their own summer assignments, students can still excel and be ready for school when they return, and have that ideal Summer that isn't behind a book or keyboard.

Giving students the opportunity to create, and design their own Summer work opens endless opportunities and can actually inspire learning new things inside and outside of the standard curriculum. By having majority of students elect a certain amount of peers to create these assignments for them, which would give a students insight on how much work we should be given, and how flexible it should be. Teachers still will have to approve of the work created and revise if, and as needed to make sure it is adequate and follows the curriculum to prepare students. With all of this said and done, many arguments can arise about how elected students could give minimalist work because they feel pressured by friends and other peers to make it easy, which is all more reasons teachers should still oversee the process, and decide if it is fair or not.

If schools eventually decide to let students design, and assign their own Summer homework this could still come with much skepticism, being a new concept means it could come with some minor flaws to be discovered. Yet with the proper determination and open willingness to change both students and teachers can benefit and be ready for the new school year when they return with the newly founded knowledge they need to succeed in their new year, while having their ideal vacations and spending time with their family instead of being behind a book or keyboard.
