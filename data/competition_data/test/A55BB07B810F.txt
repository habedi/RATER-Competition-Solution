TEXTING AND DRIVING ESSAY

Today, a lot of car accidents are caused by distracted driving. Texting while driving caused a lot of deaths and injuries Over the last few years. People confused themselves when it comes to texting and driving and they don't realize it's a mistake until it's too late. In my opinion I think its best if people turn their phones of completely before they leave their location. Texting and driving is against the law so young drivers and older adults should take it serious.

It doesn't matter who's texting you that notification can wait. Taking your eyes off the road while driving should never be acceptable. Me personally, I don't think it's the smartest decision to pick up my phone while driving for any reason. Another reason why it's not safe to text and drive is because it's against the law. Breaking the law against texting and driving results in you having to pay money out your pockets. So just try your best to avoid the situation.

Statistics are rising fast for car accidents caused by texting and driving. We all know the love ones at home wouldn't want us to be a part of that statistic. We can change our ways and lower the statistic by simply obeying the law and being patient enough to wait to check our phones. If you don't care enough to avoid a simple mistake, then so be it. My purpose for writing this essay is so people understand how risky texting and driving is so let's make it easy for one another and not be a part of that group of people who partake in texting and driving.
