Their are three reasons why Luke's point of view convince people that they should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason was that it was an expirience of a life time,he does what he likes to do,and he gets free time to do fun things. Thoes are the reasons why Luke's point of view convinces others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I can support this answer that the Seagoing Cowboy's program was an expirience of a life time when the passage says "but the Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger"."It opended up a new world for him". I can also support that it was an exprirence of a life time when the text says,"I'm greatful for this for this opportunity,"he says."It makes me more aware of people in other contries and their needs."thats the reason that it was an expirience of a life time.

I can support that he gets to do what he likes to when the texts says that "Biside helping people ,I had a side benifitt of seeing

Europe and China. I can also support that he likes what hes doing when the text says "Luke also tored and excavatede Crete and marvoloues at the Panamna Canal on his way to China."

I can support that found free time to do fun thing when the text says the cow boys played baseball and volleyball table tennis and more fun things. They also boxed read whiting and more those are the reasons how he got to do fun things

In conclusion he did alot of things to inspire people to be a Seagoing Cow boy. If mre people were like hime the world would be a better place.
