Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system and is extremely dangerous and deadly, but is also the planet that most like Earth. The author of the article supports his idea that going to Venus is a great idea reasonably well, although he doesn't use that much information to prove his claim. The author states a lot of the dangers of going to Venus and then addresses his points of wanting to study Venus more closely.

The author tells the reader that many Astronomers are fascinated with Venus because some people have a theory that Venus was once like Earth. He states that in Venus's past it might have been covered largely with oceans and could've had life on it, just like earth. The author even states that Venus still has some features on it that Earth has such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author also decribes that Venus could sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. The author uses examples of technology that could help us research more about Venus, such as NASA's blimp-like vehicle which could allow scientists to float above the carbon dioxide littered atmosphere, but most of his points about technology wouldn't work because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, which would make most forms of photographs and videos ineffective.

The author of this article claims that Venus is worth the cost and risk just to learn more about it but doesn't support his claim well enough to presuade the reader to agree with him. He backs up technology that wouldn't work because of the atmosphere surrounding Venus and doesn't show ways how we can get past the deadly atmosphere without risk. The author doesn't show enough reason that scientist should study Venus besides that it might have closely resembled Earth in the past.
