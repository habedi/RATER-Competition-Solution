Dear Principal,

How you been? I hope you say good because I am going to tell you why you should go with policy 1. You might think you want to go with policy 2, but u shouldn't. Say you was a student and you have your cell phone in your pocket and somebody called you during class.

Instead the you getting in trouble you should tell them who called you say they should get in trouble. It wasn't your fault for having your phone and someone calls you. That person should get in trouble not you because probably was waiting for lunch and it was next period to text your mom or dad. If go with policy 1 people have there cell phones off and they can turn it on at lunch. What if something happens to your parents like they got into a accident and they are badly injured, but you would find out at lunch that your parents are hurt. It would be your fault if you go with policy 2 because that means we can't bring them to school at all. Then you get home and expect to see your parents sitting on the couch waiting for to get home. If you go with policy 1 you can still keep in touch with your family but at lunch and not class. That is way better than leaving your phone at home and not being able to call them, then calling them. It is still up to, you heard why I think you should go with policy one, now time to choose which one to pick.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
