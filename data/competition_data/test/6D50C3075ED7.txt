Dear principle, work, work, work, you say you want us to try our best on projects but it is had without phones. There are clubs and plenty of other things to do after school. Without a phone if a club meeting is canceled we can still get a ride home. I think it would be sensible to let us bring phones to school.

A lot of kids are in clubs, if the club meeting is canceled then how are we going to get a ride home; the solution to that is to let us bring phones to school. If we can't bring phones to school then a lot of parents wouldn't let kids join after school clubs. You say that you don't want kids on the street, so if we have a phone we can join after school clubs, and not be on the street.

So without phones we can't join after school clubs. I learned that phones can be a problem, but can also help us out a lot to. So that is why phones should be aloud. So I believe that it would be in the best interest of us to let us have phones at school.
