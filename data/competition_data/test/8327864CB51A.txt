Dear Principal,

I understand your concern on the growing cell phone use at school. It interferes with our learning and it distracts us from our responsibilities. Cell phones were given to us by our parents or were payed for by us so that we can interact in healthy ways and can communicate. They help us learn how to talk to other people our age and older, or younger, and they help us learn responsibility for our belongings.

My response to the cell phone use at school is, let us have them at school, but, let us have them out at free time. Those times include: lunch, in the halls, in the locker rooms, outside, after class, etc. If we are not doing anything productive at those times then why can't we have them out anyways? They aren't being used as cheating methods. They aren't being used as ways to be distracted because we aren't doing anything but talking anyways. A way to make sure we don't have them during class is to make sure, by watching them turn their phones off while class is in session, then they can turn them off when class is dismissed.

Also, another good reason we should be allowed to have cell phones at schools is because it would be an easier way to call our parents if need be. We wouldn't have to get up go to the office and call from that phone. We could just text, or call, from our own cell phones, because sometimes parents think their child is in trouble if they see the school number pop up on their phone.

I thank you for taking time for reading my letter and I sincerely hope that you will think about the option of cell phone use during free time at our school. I understand it is a growing problem and I understand that is distracts us from the whole reason why we even come to school. Again, thank you!

Sincerely,
