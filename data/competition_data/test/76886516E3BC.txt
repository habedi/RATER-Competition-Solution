Drivers and Cell Phones

Although there's laws against it, people on the daily use their cellphones while driving. They'll check social media, text, call, and use its other functions. While it may seem like this doesn't uphold any problem or threat, this can be very distracting to not only the driver, but other drivers around them. However, some still think it's harmless, despite all the news stories and other tales of accidents while drivers were holding their cellphones.

One might argue that drivers using their cellphones aren't always dangerous, and that they most phones have voice command features and others like that which can allow the driver to use their phone without even touching it. And while this can be good way to use a phone while driving, the voice commands aren't always accurate and the driver might be tempted to fix any mistakes it makes before sending their message or going through with whatever they used the voice command for. In this case it makes using the voice command at all completely pointless. In other words, the phone would still be distracting to the driver.

Most of the people who use their phones while driving are usually of a younger age, such as their teen years or early twenties. Since younger people are usually around their phones more often, it's easier for them to become distracted more easily by it, and in turn they could cause a car accident which could harm not only them, but the other people around them. All of this could be avoided if certain laws were put in place to prevent people even touching their phones while driving.

While there can be ups and downs to having phones while driving, it's typically not a good idea. There have been countless tragedies related to cellphones while driving, most of which could have been prevented. It's one thing to have been holding a phone if it were a case of emergency, but that's usually not the case. People tend to disregard the safety laws regarding safety while driving, and it can be a danger to everyone involved, which is an issue that could be fixed by putting laws in place in order to keep drivers safe.
