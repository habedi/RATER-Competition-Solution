The policy that is better is if we can bring normal clothes not uniform and to bring electronics to school like I pod's and cell phones as longer they are turned off during class. But we can use them in lunch period and in another free period. Because if we cant use them that is boring we cant do anything just learned and learned we need to have fun in school too and watch movies too. Like go to more field trips like the movies and watch a cool movie like scary movie. We are turning off the cell phones in the classes and in lunch period we can use them. We don't like bringing uniform to school because we can not put whatever we want to we need to bring the school colors we cannot bring colors that we want to. And to let us bring games such as nintendo ds, psp etc.... Let us bring things like that .
