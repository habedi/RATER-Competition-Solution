What I think about this emotional expression technology is that I don't think it's too important. The reason I think this way is because there isn't a point to having one in the classroom why would the class want or need an emotional expression. Yes I do know some of the classmates would like to use one but it wouldn't be so important, but

Sometimes you can know how your friend or a person feels just by asking them or just by the look on there face. I know this because in the story it also say's "For instance , you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." what this tells me is, another reason why a class dosen't need an emotion expression I feel like it might just take up there time just by using that type of technology and the class might not have much care for the class.
