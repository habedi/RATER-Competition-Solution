Yes, I think "students should be in community service at least 4 to 5 hours according to the weather it should helpful to most of the students according to their grades" or something like that and some students think it takes up to much of their "time" and some of the little children wants to pick up any trash around the community just to help the older kids but some of them don't want to "pick up any trash" to make their town or community but the principal should make all of them do it don't matter if they want to or not because our "community needs all the support and help they can give most of them don't care about our community or how it look our government needs all the help and support you can give just to make it look good" but i would help the community out a little bit it don't make no since for our town to look a mess and all you have to do is pick up the trash that you see its not that hard to do that for our community not for us for them its a "crying shame" that our community look like a hurricane came over and knock everything off and just made a mess but i cant worry bout it cause i do what i have to do to keep our community in "good shape and good condition" but some people "don't care" we have litter all over the town what if someone from way across country and see our town is a mess they gone say "they don't know how to keep stuff clean around here" and who can make people pick up trash but someone needs to help pick up all the trash they see in every place but the principal needs to make them older kids out there to clean up the community our town would be a nice looking place if we would just keep it clean for "we can set a example for the other people maybe they will keep they community clean and looking good set a example for the good not the bad keep your community clean looking good for others." "KEEP OUR COMMUNITY CLEAN"
