I think that students should be required to do community service. Some students may think it takes up time but i think that we should start committing some of our time to community service. I think we should commit some of our time to community service because our community would look and be better, it would help keep some kids out of trouble, and it would provide us with a much healthier environment.

First of all i think community service is a good way to keep our community looking and being better. One reason i think that is because no trash would be on the ground because kids are helping pick it up. The community would be better because it would be kept up and would be looking better because we are committing some of our time to make sure our community is at it's best. When you put in a little time to keep up your community it could really reward you in the end.

Another reason we should keep up our community is because it would keep some kids out of trouble. I know that some kids act up to get attention but by doing work for the community and others they can get attention in a good way. "Kids will be kids," is what some say but they can be kids and have fun and help others by being just their self. I think that by helping the community it would help save some kids futures.

Once again i think that helping out in the community is good because it could help us have a much healthier environment. By keeping up with what we throw in the trash and where we throw it is even helping the community. When kids help out and volunteer that's helping the community. Even just helping someone walking along the street and pick up things that shouldn't be on the street is still helping the community.

Last but certainly not least helping the community is a good thing and it's the kindness out of your own heart that counts. You may not get a reward but you helped the community out so u rewarded the community. By helping the community it kept other kids out of trouble, it helped the community look and be better, but it also helped keep it clean and health. So for all those kids out there helping the community , thank you from me and others how appreciate you.
