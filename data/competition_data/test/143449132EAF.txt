Dear principal,

I strongly believe that students should not be required to perform community service because students may have no time on their hands to fit in community service. Also kids might have after school activities. Lastly that might put them behind on their school work .Yes it could teach them responsibility but it also could affect them in a negative way.

Like kids might not have enough time on their hands to fit in community service. Like say they get detention from a teacher or have after school responsibilities from their parents. For example picking up a sibling or cleaning their room. If they have community service that might affect this and nothing will get done. Also they won't make it to community service and have to make up the time.

Kids might have after school activities like football, dance or baseball. If kids have community service after school they might miss their sport or be late and have to sit out and watch. This can result in the kids not knowing whats going on in the sport and their coaches sitting them out during a game. For example if somebody takes dance after school he or she might not be able to participate in the performance because of community service. Also i would be a waste of parents money if they are paying for their child to play a sport and not being able to go because of community service.

Lastly it might put kids behind in their school work like not handing in extra credit or doing homework. For example if kids have to go to a community service after school, be late to their activity then go home and start your homework. Kids would get tired and not want to do homework. Also i don't think kids should have to juggle all these responsibilities at this age! I believe that community service should only take place when a child is disobedeant.

In conclusion kids should not have to take community service after school. It might cause the students grades to lower, not participating in after school activities or some kids might not have enough time to fit in community service. Thank you.

sincerely,

A Student at SCHOOL_NAME
