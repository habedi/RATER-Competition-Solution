I was discussing the face with a friend who thinks it's created by aliens and I think it was not created by aliens. These are my reasons why I think it is a natural landform. NASA and other scientist said it was a natural landform. The face was equivalent of a butte or mesa says NASA.

The face is ether a buute or mesa landforms because it is common around the American West. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Sanke River Plain of Idaho.

If it was an airplane on the ground orEgyptian-style pyramids or even a small shacks, you could see what they were. Few scientist belived the face was an alien artifact. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

Scientist at the Jet Propulsion Lab saw it and thought it was another Martian mesa but it had an unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. It had eyes, nose, and mouth as a human. Not everybody was satisfied that it was a natural landform.

These are the reasons why I think the face on Mars is a natural landform and not created by aliens. The face is just another mesa on the planet Mars. Do you think it was made by aliens or just another natural landform on Mars?
