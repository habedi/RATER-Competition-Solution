Dear Principal,

I think your first policy is better because then maybe student will know not to use there phones in class when you gave them the privilege to use it during free time and at lunch. Also if you tell them they can only use it during free time and lunch the might like it because at least they are using there phones in school. Maybe it will help them focus more giving them an opportunity to use there phone in school. If you chose policy 2 that will get kids upset and make them want to use there phones in school even more. Like people say if you tell kids not to do something the still do. So policy 1 is better because by letting them use there phones in school them might have the scenes not to use there phones in class because the don't want to lose the privilege of using there phones in school. It will make kind understand that they are given an opportunity to have some free time to use there phones and they wouldn't want to mess that up. If kind don't listen and start using there phones in class again then that's when you cant enforce policy 2, but some kind wont listen. Some kind will try and hide there phones if you try to enforce policy 2 because they know if you tell them to do some thing they don't want to they will still do it despite what you have to say.
