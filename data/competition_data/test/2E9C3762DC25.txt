Imagin if all summer projects were only designed by teaches. It would be no fun. Students should be able to chose whatevery they want to reaserch and make a project out of it. While some would prefer a teacher designed project, student designed projects lets students chose their own topic, experiment the way they want, and present it the way they want.

Student designed projects lets students chose any topic they want. I love it when I get to chose my own project because I can research any of my desired intrests. Chosing my own topic also motivates me to get the project done; for that, I am a curious person. Any project should let students chose their own topic.

Students should experiment any way they want. When I was a freshman in highschool my science teacher let experiment any way we wanted; I built a solar panal that followed the sun. That project let me have lots of fun and made me be crative. Student designed projects lets students expeiment in thier own way and have fun when their doing it.

Presentations should be apeling and informative to the reader. When I design a project I like to make the project the most crative and informative. Most teaches just say to make a power point or an essay, but that doesn't show any crativity. Student designed projects lets students present how they want to present and let them be as crative as thay want.

Some might like teacher designed projects because students do not have to think of a project; however, student designed projects let students chose thier topic, experiment however way they want, and present the way they want. Summer project should be fun and crative because it is student's break from school. Most student projects are fun, crative, and gives students freedom.
