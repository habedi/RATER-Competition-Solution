Dear Principal,

Hello, I am writing you this letter because I believe that if you are reconsidering the issue of having cell phones at school, or during the students free time then i think you think about the policy number two. I read the policies and I recommend that you should consider policy number two because if you go with policy number one and allow cell phones during the students lunch, or during free time then no matter what you say the students will not listen and the students will think that they can text in class and will not be paying attention to the teacher. Since you said that there can be cell phones then they will think you can have them anywhere at anytime. The students will also be lookingm If you have policy number two then they will have to be paying attention our there phone will must likely be picked up and will cost a fine to pick it up. Also if there are not supposed to be phones they will not be tempted to turn them on to text or call.

I really hope that you listened to what I had to say and you recommend going with the policy number two that doesn't let the students have there cell phones at school at all.
