Dear Principle,

I have been hearing a lot of talk about how you are going to change the school cell phone policy.

I think that you should allow students to bring phones to school, and let them use them during lunch periods and other free times.

I don't think they should be on during classes though.

I also think the other kids at school will agree with this and follow the policy.

Here are some reasons why I strongly think you should make this the new cell phone policy.

One reason I think that the new cell phone policy should be policy one is because then kids still couldn't have their phones out in class.

So i mean they aren't going to do anything bad or cheat or anything.

Plus then they would be able to use their phones during passing times and at lunch, so they wouldn't feel the need to use them during classes as much.

It wouldn't really be better fort eh students because if you ban phones kids are still going to bring them and use them so it is just pointless to use that policy.

And that is why i think the new cell phone policy should be policy 1.

Another reason I think the new cell phone policy should be policy 1 is because if you use policy 2 students are still going to bring and use their phones at school.

Their parents gave them a phone for a reason... to use.

So that is what they are going to do.

They will just secretly use them.

I know that maybe you think that it will work but it really wont if they really want to use their phones they still will.

That's why i think you should use policy 1, they still wont be able to use their phones during class with that one.

The last reason i think you should use policy 1 instead of policy 2 is because students would like this better.

I know that!

They could than communicate with their friends, their friends that don't go to the same school as them.

When you were a teenager your friends are the thing that keep you going, right?

Well that is how it is now, they needs to be able to talk to all their friends all the time.

In class they are busy and working and doing all that boring stuff.

At lunch students want to talk to all their friends and the cell phone makes it possible.

That's why i think you should choose policy 1.

So you can see that policy 1 would be a better fit for teenagers.

I hope now you can understand that.

So please pick policy 1.

It would make all the students very happy! Thank you for your time!
