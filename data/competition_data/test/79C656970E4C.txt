Phones & Driving

In today's society, Phones have become a necessity. There are even some people that own two phones. Many people have become so reliant on their phone that they have built a tendency to use it whenever they can, or when they feel like it is ok to use it. People use their phones when they are out with family, friends, or when they are driving. Phones have become a menace to our safety on the road. Although, there are some drivers that are responsible when it comes to driving, that does not make the road any safer. Everyone still has a chance of getting into an accident with someone who was too busy on their phone while driving.

People who use their phones while driving are part of the menace to our safety. People who use their phones while driving are distracted from what is happening around them. Some people are against phone usage while driving, but are the people who usually do it. People today do not usually commit to a cause because they believe it will never be achieved, so they just join in and start to not care of what might happen next. That is why laws on phone use while driving should be much harsher.

There are laws against phone usage in the United States, but that does not completely stop people from using their phone. Laws should be much stricter, and a bit of a bigger punishment. If the laws that prohibit the use of phones while driving were much stricter then maybe the use of phones while driving will deplete greatly. This will result in accidents going down which would make the road a safer place for new drivers, and drivers in general.

Laws on phone usage while driving should stricter. This resolves in less accidents, safer roads, and cops not having to pull over and write multiple tickets, or arresting as many people just for using their phones as they drive.
