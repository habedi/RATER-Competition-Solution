now days you can find a car with the stuff a computer can do inside.

back then you had to do everything to not crash because they didnt have the same stuff for cars back then than they do now. i dont think they should make car that drive by themself. First because sometimes some one can still your car and it can crash its self. second because it can waist gas and your not even driving it. i think that they shouldnt make driverless cars because i just dont see someone sitting in a car and just waiting thier to get to thier destanation. second some people probaly just want to drive thier car instead on waiting and letting the car do all the work. inpluse people might dont fill save letting thier car do all the work. And it can be dangours. because if someone is a crimanl and the cops are chaseing them all they have to do is duck down in the car and let the car do all the work. And its a good chase thell get away to. And people might think its to much work or unnessary to drive a driverless car. althought haveing a camera watching its still bad to have a driverlees car for my reasons.
