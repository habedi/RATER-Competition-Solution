In America, students are far from the top performing in the world, while time spent in classrooms is among the highest. The American Education System has gone mostly unchanged for decades. While the world evolves technologically and ideologically, American students are still stuck in a seven hour school day with primitive learning methods. Recently, however, some schools have began to adopt online curriculum that allow students to work from home. Online courses can benefit students by giving them a break from being in school, learning to motivate themselves, and preparing them for a future of technology.

Sitting in a desk for seven hours a day is not conducive to learning. By giving students a few days on online work per week, they will be more attentive and productive when they are in school. The same studies that show shorter work days are beneficial also apply to school days. Especially with children, many people struggle to sit in one spot and focus for so long. This can make the traditional school day very ineffective for some kids. Online classes, however, will allow for students to take break when they need to. These breaks can help to eliminate boredom, and help students to take in the material and finish their work. Additionally, The school environment may also be a stressful place for some students. By being at home, this may offer the comfort that kids need to work effectively.

After graduation, teachers will not still be there to push students to do their work. Many kids struggle with independence because they are babysat through school. the online courses will introduce the need for discipline and time management. These essential skills will be vital to the success of students. By overcoming the urges to slack-off or procrastinate, students will become stronger and learn to tackle challenges on their own. This will result in better performance in school, but also in the real world when it really matters. This ultimately adds lots of value to the purpose of school today: preparation for adulthood.

Just twenty years ago, computers in school were extremely rare. Today, almost every student and teacher have a computer in their pocket. Technology is the future, and schools should represent that future. Many colleges offer degrees obtainable entirely online and remotely. Additionally, many employers offer tele-working days where employees can work from home on their computers. The school system's inability to adapt to evolving trends will render students at a disadvantage after graduation.

As the world evolves, education should too. Online classes will offer a myriad of benefits to help students currently in their schoolwork and in their future careers. While some may argue that online classes will not be involved enough or offer too much freedom to students, they are missing the need for change. Schools cannot stay the same forever; innovation had outgrown the classroom.
