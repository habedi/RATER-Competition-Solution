Many countries were in ruins and they needed the help that the Seagoing Cowboys provided.

Next, more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because they would get to see and visit many unique and interesting places around the world. The text states, Luke was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. The text also states, on his many trips, Luke got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.
