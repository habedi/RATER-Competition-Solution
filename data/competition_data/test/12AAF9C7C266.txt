Dear Principle ,

I think it not fair that people that have

B' s or an A' s could join a sport or another activity . i Find it unfair. I have many reasons to tell You why its not fair. i would at least tell you three things why it not fair that people that have A or B average get to join a sport or another activity.

First of all , Its not fair because you never know if your students have been working hard to pass there classes. Maybe they are working there butt off to pass but maybe they might find there classes harder Because what they say the older you the harder it gets in school.

Second of all , I think you should let people that actually want to learn join activity's or join a sport, and the people that don't want to learn they could get everything taken away like there break or lunch and give them back there freedom when they actually do better . Just don't take away the people that are trying to do better there fun.

Third of all ,

I find it un fair that mostly people that have B' s and A' s get to join a sport because that makes the other people feel bad . Everyone can join a sport or an activity because school is like family and we get to do what other people do to.

So That's why i find it unfair because that people with A' s and B 's get to join activity's
