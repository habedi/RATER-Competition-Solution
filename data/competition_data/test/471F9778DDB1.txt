Dear principal,

I have been informed that you have been considering letting us bring our cell phones to school.

I believe that it would be an excellent choice to allow students to bring cell phones for the following reasons. If there was an emergency students could call police or a hospital depending on the emergency, if something was wrong with a student that student could call his/her parent to come and pick them up, and many other reasons. If you were to not allow students to bring their phones they would feel the need to bring them anyway and could possibly get suspended for bringing their cellular devices. If you allow cell phones in the school some students might actually not want to bring their phones because of the fact that they are allowed. Texting, of course would not be a problem because students' phones would be off and the students will not be able to text or play games on their cell phones. In my closing statement I ask that you consider allowing mp3 players and other music playing devices.

sincerely,
