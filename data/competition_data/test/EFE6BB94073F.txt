Dear principal ,

I think your making a huge mistake on not letting students participate in the sports if they have a C now that's not fair , don't you want our school to be number one,

! Well we do and you can not let students participate if they have a D or an F , i think its not fair cause for me that means like if you don't have a B or an A you can t pass to the next grade. But your the principal you make the rules , its going to be a bad idea for that change so you should take my word and not do that. Many students struggle on doing there homework that's why they probably have a C , or maybe they just don't get it. But i think its a mistake many students are going to be sad. Maybe is you take the students out of lets say a soccer team , you will probably take out a good player . That's why i think you shouldn't do that .

Sincerely ,
