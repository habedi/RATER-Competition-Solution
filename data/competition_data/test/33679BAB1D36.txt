Dear Principal,

You are changing the school policy so students have to have a grade B average in order to participate in after school sports or other activities. This will not allow people to interact with others, get in exercise, or have any free time from school. What your doing is a bad idea.

How do you expect students to interact with others if they have no where to go after school? If this happens students will loose friends or not see them as often. Students would struggle in school because they would no one encouraging them to do better. Having friends in and out of school is very important.

Another reason is we would loose exercise because we would have no where to go. After school sports and activities are helpful because it allows students to stay in shape and stay healthy. They would have to stay at home doing homework and trying to get there grades up. This means they will start gaining weight and eating more.

Having free time from school is very helpful. It relieves a lot of stress and allows you to get school off your mind. Free time lets you hang out with friends and family. Also it allows you to go outside and be interactive, and healthy. If you have to worry about grades all the time you become stressed out and up tight. Sports allows you to let out all of those things.

These are all ways that hurt students during the school year. No one can have any fun at sports practices or games because they won't even be allowed to play. And kids won't be able to participate in other activities.

From,

Student
