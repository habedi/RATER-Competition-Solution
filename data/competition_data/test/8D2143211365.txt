I agree with this decision becasue, the people that can not play sports or dont want to can do something else. For example they can work on the yearbook or serve on the student council, and for the people that do like sports can choose to do the sports. Either way i think that its fair because you can choose what you want to do, instead of getting to only choose one activity.

I think its good how the principal gave you choices because if they did not and they gave you something that you would have to pick then i would have to disagree, but that is not the case. But i know there are some people that would not want to do any of the options to pick from. But i think there are enough options, that someone can find atleast one thing they would find fun or would would not mind doing.

I also think it will help us threw the school day because, if you pick the sports or something more active it will get your energy pumping. If you choose to do something that is more like work then your always learning more, and it will help you with doing work and you will be working your brain.

In conclusion i agree with the decision because it is fair for everyone and every can have a different option to pick from. The options also benefit you in different ways in the sports and more active options they help you with energy and health, and the work side of options help you with working your brain and learning more.
