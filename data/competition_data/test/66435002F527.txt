Summer projects are one way that teachers can have their student prepare for the next school year. While some students might dislike the idea of doing projects over the summer they are necessray for academic improvement. One way to increase the learning done for these projects is to have them student designed. Having student designed projects will ensure that the student will enjoy the project, increase the chance that the student will complete the project, and produce a higher quality of work.

By allowing students to design the project you ensure that they enjoy the area of study. Students who do not like history should not be forced to complete project on the history of their town. The same is true with a student who doesn't like math. I personally have expierenced this through my work in the VASTS program. The program is an NASA run organization that has allowed me to study the areas of subject that I enjoy. When a student enjoys an area of subject they are more likely to study and work hard. This is important because the summer is suppossed to be a break from school, and having student designed project will make the work feel like less of a task. If the student does not like what they are studying the work will not be done.

Allowing the student to select his or her own project will lead to higher completion rates. Universtiy studies show that when a student enjoys an aera of study they are more likely to work hard and complete the assignment on time. This is important because over the summer there are no teachers to hold students accountable. Without pushing from teachers it is important to ensure that the students push themselves. While teachers can check on student progess during the school day, this is impossible over the summer. Teachers can send emails, but students can simply delete te emails as they come in. If the student enjoys the topic they selected then they will feel self motivated to complete the project.

Allowing the student to be motivated by a self selected project will make the work seem easier and produce a higher quality of work. When a student already knows more about a topic it makes it easier to create a project. This is imporant because a long and hard project will make the student feel less motivated. Leading the student to rush through the project the week before the start of school. However, a project that the student selected will motivate them. A motivated student is more likely to create a good project and work throughout the summer instead of just the week before the project is due.

Although some teachers might argue that students will come to school with different levels of knowledge because they select their own topics, this problem can be quickly solved. Instead of beginning the year with lectures and worksheets teachers could allow the students to share there projects with one another. Several schools are beginning to shift the the self teach and then share model. This model allows students to craft their own views and then share with the class. This would allow for students to not only learn but also get to know each other. Something that modern schools say is important for class disscussions. After the projects have been shared the teacher can go take a class and go over what facts the students might have missed.

The fact that students will enjoy what they are working on, be more likely to complete the project, and produce a higher quality of work make it evident that if summer projects are assigned they must be student designed. Over the summer students do not want to work and a student designed proect will help motivate the students to complete the project. The concerns of students entering the school year with varied amounts of knowledge is something that is quickly resolved by having students share their projects with on another.
