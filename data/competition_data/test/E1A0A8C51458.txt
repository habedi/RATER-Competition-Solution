In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author talks about the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This would enable computers to identify human emotions. Say you were looking at ads and you didn't like one ad so you frowned, the computer would be able to detect that and it would show you something different, but if you smiled then it could show you something similar to that ad. This new technology would be very helpful and valuable in classrooms.

Being able to use this technology in classrooms could be such a help for some students. Since now majority of schools use laptops in the classrooms or they go to computer labs to work this could be a help. There are a lot of students that are afraid to ask their teacher for help when they don't understand a probelm that they are working on because they feel embarrassed for not understanding something that most of the class in understanding. Having this technology in class that could read your facial expressions while you are working could be a huge help. The technology could be able to tell if a student is confused, nervous, or any other emotion while he or she is working on the lesson. The computer would be able to continue going at the pace it is going while going over the lesson, or be able to slow down its pace if the student shows expressions of not understanding what is going on. The technology could even recognize when the student is becoming bored of the lesson and it could be able to make the lesson more exciitng. The technology would be able to modify the lesson with any type of facial expression.

Some people might argue that they don't want their face to be read by a computer because they think that the governement could be watching their children, but once they see that their childrens grades have possibly improved because of this new technology they will change their mind. This is why this technology would be valuable in classrooms.
