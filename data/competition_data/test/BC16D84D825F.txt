Dear principal,

I think that the school should adopt the first policy that you are considering. I have two reasons for choosing this policy over the other. One reason for my support of the first policy is that it allows students to connect with there friends, during the day that they may not otherwise meet with. Also, phones are sometimes necessary for students to have to connect with their parents when they are after school for the activities that may occur at that time such as clubs and need to be picked up.

Phones are becoming more and more important for school age students to connect and converse with friends, meaning taking this fully away from students could potentially make friends relationships weaker, giving students less moral support that would normally come from friends. Moral support is a large asset in later years for students because of the larger work loads that are given, making a breach of a connection between friends, a negative thing, also affecting the students, possibly in their grades. Because of this, the school could even be negatively affected.

Phones are also the main form of communication between students and their parents or other family members. This would also have a negative affect on students because it could cause challenges for students to coordinate with their parents to find out when they should meet each other for things such as being picked up after school for clubs. In turn, this could cause problems because of the overwhelming number of students needing to borrow the school telephones, again negatively affecting the school. There have been points this year when I haven't been able to use my cell phone to call my mom to pick me up after school and have had to wait for her for extended periods of time until she finally reached the school.

Phones are clearly necessary, most likely, for almost all the students at this school. This is why I support the first plan that would allow the use of cell phones at some points during the school day but not at any point during class time.

From,
