What if, after summer ends, you lose all of what you've learned from the previous year? This is something that neither the students' teachers or families want to happen to them. To combat this, several schools require students to work on projects, given to them before the school year ends, and complete them to ensure that they continue to learn. The only real question now is, "Should the projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?" The answer to this question, based on what I believe, is that these summer projects should be designed specifically for the students. This is because that the students are the ones that doing the project, not the teachers; the projects should not be designed for teachers, because they are the ones who are helping the students to learn; lastly, students will more likely have more free time than teachers.

The first reason for why I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed is that the students are the ones that are doing the projects, not the teachers. This is because the whole purpose of the summer projects is to make sure that the students are continuing to learn, and there's also the fact that the teachers have already learned what they needed at school; therefore the summer projects should be student-designed.

The second reason for my decision is that the projects should not be designed for teachers, because they are the ones helping the students to learn. The point behind this is that even though each teacher teaches his or her students in their own way, their main objective is to help students gain the skills they need to succeed in college and adulthood. Therefore, it would be wierd if the summer projects were designed with teachers in mind.

The third and final reason as to why schools should design their summer project with students in mind is simply because students will more likely have more free time than teachers. Although the amount of free time for students may vary depending on their summer plans, teachers will have to focus on preparing for the next school year, leaving them with less free time than students.

Even though some people think that summer projects should be teacher-designed because the teachers are the ones that will give the projects to their students, and that it would be easier to categorize students, based on their classes, that's not guaranteed to be the best case. Because due to this project being for the students and not the teachers, and due to the possible, extra free time that the students will have during summer, I believe that should schools end up giving students projects over summer break, that they should be designed with the students in mind.
