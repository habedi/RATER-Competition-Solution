"A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored," said Dr. Huang and also predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This would be ground breaking if children, high schoolers, and even audlts coould use this techonology. It would change how everyone on this plant learns everything.

This is very vauble because the computer will be able to tell if you are happy, sad, confused, angry and other emothions. The computer could change its lesson around you and not what it is just programed to do like computers right now. Everyone human on this earth learns differently. Some students are more visual than others and some get distracted more. This program would help everyone equaily. Everyone on this planet learns differently and that is why this program would be so helpful to our education and future on earth.

This product would be so valuable to our society today. We need something like this for our education. Everyone would be able to learn how they want to learn and everyone would be given a fare and even learning expericne.
