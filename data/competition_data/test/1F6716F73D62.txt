In the text, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author explains why he thinks that we should continue to try and explore Venus, even with the harsh conditions Venus has. The author makes sure to explain the conditions on Venus and why they are so dangerous, but he also makes sure to explain why it is important that we find a way to deal with those conditions, so that we can continue to study Venus.

In paragraph three the author talks about the conditiolns on Venus like how it is "97 percent carbon dioxide, and how the clouds on Venus are full of "highly corrosive sulfuric acid". He explains that the conditions are unlike anything that humans have ever encountered.

That is the reason he belives we should study it, because it is unlike anythig we have seen before. The argument gets even better when the author says "Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. He goes on to explain the rocky conditions, they see on Venus, and the possible evidence on vast oceans that could of been.

The author supports his idea so well becuase he tells us about the harsh conditions on Venus, Which is the biggest factor making it so hard to explore, and then goes on to explain why that is the reason we should study it. It is because it is something new, and unknown. Not to mention it is belived that Venus could have been just like Earth once. Opening up the possibility of seeing where things on Venus changed.

So we can possibly stop that if Earth ever starts going into the direction that Venus has.

The author does a great job of explaning how what we see on Venus is unknown, and explaning that, that is the very reason we should continue to try and study Venus. He even gives alternatives ideas to landing on Venus. He explains that what is unknown and what could possibly be so closley realted to Earth should be studies even with the challeges in presents. The author best explained it when he said, in paragraph eight."Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"
