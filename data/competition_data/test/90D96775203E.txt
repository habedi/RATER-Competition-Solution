This landform on mars does look like a alien face but is just another regular landform. It doesn't prove any aliens are on mars because it is another martian mesa with really good shadow placement to fool the eye. NASA isn't trying to hide anything about aliens or extraterrestrial life because they want to find life on another planet like mars. Even if there was a alien civilazation, why isn't there any more of these or different formation and buildings on mars. That is why it is just a regular landform on mars.

Well this mesa is fooling people because it does look like a face but it is just another mesa The shadow are just placed coincedentily. The landform is pretty big so it coudln't be built fast enough for it to go unnoticed. plus NASA isn't hiding anything, why would they need to. That is one of the reasons why I think it is a coincedent.

Even though NASA seems like they want to cover it they really don't want to because it will be the biggest find ever in space age history. We send probes and rovers for research and to find life. We also send then to find the necessary elements for life to exist. If we do find life it will be the biggest news for a long time. So we really aren't trying to hide anything exspecially aboutr life on mars.

So if there was life on mars and they did make it ,why aren't there any other structures built. Like on earth aztecs did die out but had way more monuments to their gods. They didn't spend all their time building a face Plus their buildings couldn't erode away or the face would't be there. So why did they only build one ?

Those are the reasons I believe face on mars is just coincedental. We really would want to find something on mars. If we do find someting on mars the face could be evidence that there is life on mars. We will probably find out soon. Maybe find alien life on another planet.
