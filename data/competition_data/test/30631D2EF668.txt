You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It was a great opportunity, and I got to do so many things that an average small town boy would normally never do.

I met new friends, helped out people and their countries, and got to visit so many amazing places.

I loved that I got to see all the sites.

I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, saw the Acropolis in Greece, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

It was so unbelievably marvolous that I made nine whole trips of exploring and being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times, and the Pacific Ocean twice.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you will be able to do everything that I did, maybe even much more.

If you aren't already convinced, with getting to explore and tour many parts of the world, then you should know this.

With joining the Seagoing Cowboys, you get to help people and their countries' needs.

After World War 2 there is a lot to recover from in Europe and many parts of the world.

By joining us and working for the UNRRA you would be helping by taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules being shipped overseas to the needy countries.

If you like animals and don't get sea sick too easy, I say you join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Going on this journey made me more aware of people of their countries and their needs.

It changed me in a wonderful way, and it will do the same to you.

The new friends, exploration, sites to see, and people to take care of is just a few of the reasons to consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

You would be not only helping the needy, but you'd also be helping yourself become a better person.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is an eye-opening experience, and I strongly encourage you to take part in the journey.
