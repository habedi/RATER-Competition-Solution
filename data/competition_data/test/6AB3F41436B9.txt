If the story was told in first person then it would be telling us about how Luke thinks or feels. It would also say what he thinks about what he is doing,what he thinks about his friends, and what he thinks of helping others. But I bet he would think nice things about helping people because he saide that he liked the job. And when his friend asked him if he wanted to go with him he said that it was a once in a life time opportunity that it he didnt want to miss. He also said that it would be great to be in a helping team and he also liked the journey geting to Europe with his friend. Plus we would of know what he thought about the journey,the place he was helping and the job. And don't say that i'm wrong because it is true. And this is how it would look like if the story was in first person. We would also know what he thought about Italy, a city with streets of water. Plus we would also know what he thought about the castle and China. And we would of know how he felt when he craked his ribs ,or about the animal gaurd job. And what about all that fun that he had with his new friends playing base ball, vollyball, tabble tennies tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, and whittling. We would of know what he felt and thought of it. Did he like it or not. And how about his family we would of know what he thought of them. Of course he would say good things about them but still we would of know more about his thoughts and feelings. Acording to the passege luke said that it was more then an adventre to him because it opened his world and changed his life for ever. And it means that there is no better job then what he has now.
