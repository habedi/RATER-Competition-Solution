The face on Mars is just a mesa. It was not built by aliens, and I can prove it. When the face was first photographed, NASA did not have very good cameras. They were up to date but not very powerful and had bad pixles. The 1976 Viking 1 had 43 meters per pixel in the best photo.

While some people say that this is definetly alien activity, they have been proven wrong. In the 2001 photo, the great pixels showed that this was nothing more than a mesa with weird shadows. There wasn't even anything around it. There were no planes houses nothing just a big lump of rock.

This kind of mesa can be found on Earth too. There are a lot in the U.S.A. one especilly good one is a lava dome in Idaho. Even though this mesa on Mars is not lava it is a rock that looks like natural earthly structures.

Back then nobody was positive that it wasn't aliens that had built a really big sculpture, but as tecnology got better, NASA was able to say for sure that this odd thing on Mars was not aliens. Only a big mesa that was isolated on the Red Planet.
