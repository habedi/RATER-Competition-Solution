Year round school and better understanding in school for the next year? Oh Yeah. With a summer project then you remember more as you have to use the knowledge that you've gained and put it to use. Whether it be teacher-designed or student-designed is up for debate, as there are ups and downs for either choice. To teach students something new, to remind them of past subjects or to help direct the students to their ideal subject in college. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to teach something new, students don't forget what they learned previously and it makes the students think creatively.

If the teacher makes the summer project design then they can help students learn something new while they are out of school. The teacher giving the new information can have guide lines for what they need to know to complete the project, or to get a student ahead for the next year leading to a better year for both the student and future teacher. Not only would the student be able to learn something new, but they would also be able to use that new found knowledge in an efficient way. For example, then when I was in sixth grade then my parents took me out of public school and put me into home schooling. I would go onto a website that was used for teaching people from K-12th grade everything that they would need to know. I would do this from when I was taken out of school to the first year of middle school, and my knowledge and understanding of the subjects that we were learning was at the point were I wasn't the oddÂ ball in the class. With that part of the year and during the summer when not only was I able to catch up in subjects that I was a few grades lower in, but I was a level higher then everyone else for a while.

With teachers designing the summer project then students don't have to worry about it as much because they don't have to waste the time deciding what to do for the project all summer. Not only would the students be given a benefit from using the knowledge given to them, but they also get to finish it in almost half the time that they would have needed if they were to choose the project as well. There are a lot of friends that I know who can't decide on a certain subject for a project until it is either the night before it is due or the day off. They are very stressed out when this happens which leads to them failing in other classes as the extra stress from that one class is distracting them from the others.

Another benefit is that the student actually has to go out of their comfort zone, or they will stay in it, if the subject or the needed information is in a subject/ topic they like or dislike. Forcing a student to work on something that they don't understand is something that could help them understand it, and as they have to get a understanding before they can use it or they will not understand it and never get any better on the subject; making the student more creative in their methods for learning and for when they overcome harder challenges in life. For Example, they might get into a rut at a job that they have and it is getting difficult to keep going. Well if they are creative thinkers then an idea might pop into their head which could lead to them getting out of the rut and to a much happier life.

In conclusion, then if a teacher either from the last year or the next year will be able to help the students understanding grow. Although, some people think that the teacher shouldn't be the one to design it, but in fact the student, because it gives them a free choice on what to do, they have more fun doing it as it might be a subject they are interested in, and they might be able to grow in their field of experiences that interests them. It still could lead to students not doing the summer project at all because they might not be able to decide until the very last moment or not at all. If a teacher or teachers design the summer project then their is a lower chance that the student will forget information from the last year. Along with, the project being a challenge that could benefit both the student and the future teachers in the long term, with the student having a better understanding of the subject and/or the concept.
