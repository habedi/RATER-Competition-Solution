Many schools require students to do projects in the summer. These projects can be designed by teachers or students. The projects are created so the student can continue to learn over their break; but can become a problem if the student doesn't like the type of project given to them by the teacher. This is why students should be able to design their own projects. Students should be able to design their own project because they will be able to be more creative and comfortable; but teachers should design the project simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student when it comes to the topic.

First, when students can design their own project, they will be more creative and will be more likely to show what they know. The student being more creative on their project will show that that they understand the topic and don't have to follow a simple and easy format. For example, personally, I have had summer projects like my "Of mice of men" book project that was just flat out boring and not fun because the teacher gave us no room to be creative in anyway. Many students want to be creative with their projects, but when the project doesn't look appealing or will not let us be creative, we don't get a very good chance to show what we know. Then compared to my personal reading book project, where I had the freedom of being able to be creative and could show my understanding of the book. It showed the difference between being able to designing your own project or being given a teacher designed, simple project.

Furthermore, personally, when a teacher has given me a specific format; there is the feeling of uneasy because I feel if I don't follow the format, the project will be completely wrong. This example doesn't let the student feel comfortable and makes the student feel that they can't be creative in their own way. When a student gets the chance to design their own projects, the students will naturally be more comfortable. This can be shown by the students work and effort put into their projects. Being comfortable with a project for the students is a big deal because if the students don't feel comfortable, how will the students show what they have learned during their projects. A student designed project helps because it is based off of what they want to do and not something they were given.

Although, when the teachers design the projects, the teachers will know more on the topic rather than the students. This can make it to where the teachers specifically designs the projects to the topic of choice. Since the teachers design the projects, they can create and use different kinds of formats. The teachers can also choose the type of projects the students can use. This can and will give the students more options on their projects than just one, and the students can choose the type of projects based on their strengths and weaknesses. Since the teachers know more on the topic of the projects they can use that to be creative themselves by designing a project for the students that isn't something most of the students have seen before.

In conclusion, since many schools require students to do projects over the course of summer. Students should be able to design their own projects based off of them being able to be more creative and being more comfortable; but teachers should design the projects simply because the teacher is more knowledgeable than the student on the topic. Work shows when a student is comfortable with their project. When they're comfortable the can aslo become more creative. After all of these statements and supporting evidence this is why students should be able to design their own summer projects.
