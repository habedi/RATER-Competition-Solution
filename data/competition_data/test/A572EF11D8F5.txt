How would you feel if the streets were car free in the city you live in? Would you prefer it that way? I would and would not at the same time because there's less traffic. Well some cities are car free like Vauban Germany,Paris and Bogota Colombia.

To Begin With, In Vauban 70 percent of the families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. if they do own a car the car owner has to buy a car space,for $40,000, along with a home. In Paris cars were banned because of pollution and wanted to clear the air of the global city. One reason why i would prefer the city to be car free is because there is less traffic and you can get some where safely with out having to worry that you might crash or have an accident. One reason why i wouldn't prefer it to be car free is because you would take longer to get to a certain place you want to go. you would have to wait for a taxi or a bus to take to that place.
