Using a cell phone while driving is a big mistake!

Just imagine that one is driving to work to rush during hour traffic and one notices that there is a backlog of cars approaching the exit. Two cars and a police car are positioned near the exit. It looks like an accident occur and one can assume that the use of a cell-phone probably was involved. Sadly enough, most of the accidents today can be attributed to the use of cell-phones as the root cause. Drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents that could be avoided.

To begin, some people have a tendency to engage in behaviors that are not good- smoking, swimming in shark infested waters, drugs eating excessively- and using a cell-phone while driving is also one of those behaviors. Cell-phones should not be used while driving because even a two-second distraction increases the risk of crashing. Even though it has been noted that drivers who use a cell-phone drive an average of two miles slower, there is still a risk crashing due to being distracted.

Also, driving while using a cell-phone can be compared to drunk driving because in both cases, a person does not have enough focus to carry out a task. However, distracted driving is harder to prove and report compared to drunk driving. Tools like a breathalyzer and simple walking tests allow officers to determine if someone has been drinking.

Even though everyone can agree that using a cell-phone while driving is dangerous, one of the major reasons that people use cell-phones is so that they don't get bored while driving and many people get to keep in touch with friends and family while driving.

Finally, someone who is stupid enough to text and drive increases their risk of dying by 100 percent. That statistic alone should make one not use a cell-phone while operating a vehicle. There is no question that talking on a cell-phone while driving is a dangerous distraction and more penalties are needed to raise awareness about this dangerous behavior.
