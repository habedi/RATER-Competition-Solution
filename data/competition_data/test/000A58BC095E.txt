To Whom It May Concern,

Community Service, It helps other with less things get back on their feet. Some people say community service is a good thing and that everyone should do it. Some agree the same thing but don't have the time or motivation to do it. I believe that we should have community service in our school but it should be a choice for the student to do it or not.

Personally i enjoys helping the community and that i will try to make time for it. But some people don't have the time to. If it isn't sports or school work. Community service is one of the things that look good on a college application. And also it may lead to good things like a better understanding of the things going on outside of your school. Community service doesn't only have to be in your community you could also branch out and help other community that lack things that your community have.

To help the community should be a choice but it is a very good thing and will help students in their future. But forcing it on them to pick one community service wouldn't be good. They could do a bad job because they wouldn't care who effects or be missing out on something important at home. So I believe that we should have community service in our school but it should be a choice for the student to do it or not.

Thank you For your Time,

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
