Dear Principal,

I think that every student should have to do community service for picking up trash and also cleaning up the school. Every student should have to do community service because some of those students are the ones that are making the mess at school. But it is also an unfair decision because some of the students that have to be required to do community service aren't the ones usually making all of that trash so it would be wasting their time, some of the students could just be innocent. Although if you would like a clean school you might want to consider requiring community service for at least every classroom to take turns doing community service.

Those students that tend to litter at school should be the ones cleaning up after themselves. For example some students just throw their trash on the ground without even caring that it could destroy their school. Having community service is very important because the whole entire school could just build up the trash.

Therefore, the idea of having community service is a great idea. Students should be required to have community service. The school would look much better without any rubbish on the ground.

Sincerely,
