Forcing students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is an unnecessary decision. In my opinion, I believe that you should only join an activity if you want to. I also believe that extracurricular activities are meant to be completely optional. You shouldn't be forced to do something that you have no interest in doing. Some of the activities may not interest students at all and we want them to have fun, not be extremely bored because they were forced to join an activity. I disagree with the decision to force all students to participate in at least one of the activities because some students don't want to join one, others might not be able to join, and some have things to do outside of school.

First, some students don't want to participate at all. I wouldn't make them have to do something they have no interest in doing at all. For example, some could care less about playing a sport. They could also probably not care at all about joining a club, or to work on the school yearbook.

Next, some students might not be able to participate in an activity. They could be busy with something. They might not have the time to join one or some of the activities. That is the second reason why I disagree with my principal's decision to enforce students to participate in at least one activity.

Lastly, some students have things to do outside of school. They might not be able to stay back after school for one of the activities. Things like having to watch and take care of your sibling, having to go somewhere are some examples of why students wouldn't have the time to participate. They wouldn't be able to focus on things like sports, clubs, etc.

Now some may disagree and say that it's a good idea to make students join an activity but there are some pros and cons. Sure students would be learning more things but I believe that half the people there would be the ones who were forced to join in the first place. There are some benefits to being in an extracurricular activity but i don't think it should be enforced.

That is why I disagree with my principal's decision. Activities shouldn't be mandatory but just an option if you want to try something new out. I hope Generic_Name revokes this decision so we're not forced into something we don't want to do. In conclusion, I don't agree with Generic_Name's decision because some students don't want to join one, aren't able to participate, and some have things to do after and outside of school.
