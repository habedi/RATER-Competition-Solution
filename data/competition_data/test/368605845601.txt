Would you believe me if I told you that any sort of extracurricular activity would help you later on in life? Well believe me it really does and that's why I strongly agree with our principal making this rule. It won't only help you with important lifelong skills you will also make new friends. If you don't like sports there is many other activities to participate in. So these next few paragraphs will tell you all about why I agree with our principal.

One of the most common activities is school sport teams. Not only do you make new friends from it you also learn one of the most important life lessons. Teamwork is extremely important to me because you will need it for the rest of your life. Sport teams is also a great way to stay healthy and in shape. And if you are competitive in any way you will fall in love with sports.

Teamwork is a great life skill to have no matter what you do. Whatever job you do as a adult you will need teamwork to make it a sucesfull business. You need to be able to work with your co-workers to come up with ideas for your business. If you are independent you usually don't make it very far. More people will always think better than one.

If you don't like sports and aren't competitive don't stress there is still activities for you! If you enjoy stuff like yearbook club, student council, writing or anything that's considered a club you can still do an activity and enjoy it. You get the same leadership and lifelong skills you get from sports while still having fun. It's hard to make friends with the same interests but if you join a club you find many people with the same interests as you. And your'e also having fun while you learn or work.

Any one of these two things are important to do for later and life. You may not like or principals choice but I know you will one day. He's doing it for our best so we can be even better people. There is many choices to pick from so you will never feel like it's forced. I hope this opened you up to everything our school offers.
