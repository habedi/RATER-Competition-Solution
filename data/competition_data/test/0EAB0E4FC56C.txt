I disagree because People might not have enough time to participate in the activities,they might have something important going on in their life,or they cant afford any money for the club they wanna do,they might be having a tough time in different classes so they cant do any of the activity/club. Their parents must not want them to stay after school or where the activity is happening.

The first reason why i disagree is He/She might not have enough time to participate in any of the activities. They might be doing something for their teachers that need help or they did something bad so they have to stay and help their teacher out,he/she could be in trouble and has to clean the school because of what they did,he/she maybe has to stay after because they didn't complete any of their work in class so they have to do some extra work to make up what they did in class so they don't do that in class again.

The second reason why i disagree is the person might have something important going on in their life that might be important for them and it could be like He/she grandpa or grand ma could be dying soon so they don't do the activities,their might be a problem when he/she could have a father and mother in jail at the same time so they have to go home early to visit their parents in jail and listen to what their parents might say to them,maybe they have a type of disease that can be shared so they don't want anyone else getting it so they dont go to the activities instead they just go home.

The third reason why i disagree is maybe they can't afford anything for that club so they don't want to participate in on the activities,That person might be having a hard time in their life or they lived by their self cause he/she might have had no family to live with so they had to work by their self but still can't afford to pay for the club/activity,That He or she has a hard time focusing in class maybe because He/She can't afford to pay for the activities He/she might wanna take.
