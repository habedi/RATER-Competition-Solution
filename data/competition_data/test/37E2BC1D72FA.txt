Well I think that it would be nice to get to use your phones during your breaks from school. Then if u needed to tell your mom or dad something you could tell them during your break. You would be able to get your mom to bring you something if needed. You would be able to tell your friends something during the break and not have to be right there beside them.

Yes, It would be nice to get to have my phone during my break because I could tell my friends where we are going to get together. It would make school a lot easier to communicate with others in the school. We would be able to text or call or classmates and friends to find out where they are at instead of running around the school looking for them. It wouldn't take as long to find everyone to get together to work on your homework or study together. Everyone would be able to find each other ,and get together to have more study time.

You would be able to let your parents know that you are going to stay after school for something. You could get your parents to bring you something to the school. You would be able to get in touch with them while you are at school instead of waiting till you get home that afternoon. Then they would know ahead of time what you will be doing after school. It would just make everyone's lives easier to know hat is going on at school.

You will have time to talk with friends and classmates and work together to get some home work done while you are on a break. I know you are thinking that it will become a problem when you start trying the new rule with everyone's phones going of during class ,but just take there phones from them for a couple days and they will remember next time. If that doesn't work then tell them to tell there friends to help them remember to turn the sound off before there class starts.

So when you go to talk bad about the phone problem think about all the good things before you start talking bad. Don't let a couple bad kids ruin the whole phone rule, but I think it will help the students out a lot.
