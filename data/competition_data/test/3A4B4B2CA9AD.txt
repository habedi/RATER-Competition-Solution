" Generic_Name it is the beginning of your sixth grade year do you know of any clubs you would like to join?" Generic_Name's mother asked. Generic_Name shrugged his shoulders and slouched to his room." Oh Generic_Name I dont want Generic_Name to be excluded this year just like last year!" Generic_Name's mother cried." We've got to give him time, he might feel pressured if we talk to him about it too soon." Generic_Name's dad calmly said. Generic_Name's parents waited for him to make new friends or to join a club, but every single afternoon he walks into his room, then eats dinner and he doesn't say a word. That next Thursday Generic_Name came home and slouched into his room like always." I'm tired of this," Generic_Name's mom said under her breath. She walked into Generic_Name's room and screamed," Generic_Name I am tired of this, you can't hide away just because you are deaf. Your hearing aids are supposed to allow you to hear and talk to people, but you don't. You don't even talk to me." Generic_Name's dad walked in." Generic_Name tell your son that he needs to make friends or at least join a club!" Generic_Name looked at his mom in shock. Students should join a club because, it can help relieve stress from school, clubs can help you meet new people, and it can give you a hobby to do at home.

First, students get stressed easily when a big test is coming up, or if they have a lot of homework and can't do it all. Stress can make you feel unhappy which can build up anxiety. When I was in sixth grade I was not in any clubs, and during tests I would panic and forget the answers. I decided to go to the councilor for help and the councilor gave me some good tips on how to keep calm during a test. Having a club to go to can give you something to look forward to during the school day and make you feel less anxious about school work. When I was in seventh grade I joined the yearbook and FAC'S clubs. I didn't feel stressed during a test and my school work seemed easier than the year before.

Also, clubs are a great way to meet new people and make new friends. Somebody could like the same thing as you and you never knew. When I was a seventh grader I joined the yearbook club and on the first day

Generic_Name told us to get into groups of two or more and go to take photo's of the other clubs around, but I didn't know anyone. I was walking down the hallway with a boy, and to my surprise he put his hand out and said," My name is Generic_Name, I am in eighth grade." I took his hand and said," My name is Generic_Name, I am in seventh grade." Clubs can help you make that first step to say hello. In eighth grade I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club, I started talking to people that I had never talked to before. I found that these people that I have never talked to have something in common with me. I started to talk to these people I met around the school too.

Third, sometimes when you join a club that club becomes a hobby and you start to do it at home. In my seventh grade year I joined the FAC'S club. In the FAC'S club we would bake and cook food, then I started to bake cookies and brownies more often at home and I also got my brother into it too. Know even though I am not in the FAC'S club I still love to bake. Clubs can give you an opportunity to try something new, and most of the time if it is something that you like you start to do it at home. In my eighth grade year I joined the Dungeons and Dragons club. I shared it with my brother, and know we invite his friends to come play a campaign with us almost every weekend.

Generic_Name stood up and walked toward his mom, then opened his arms up to give his mom a hug. " I am sorry mom," he said," I will try to make friends." The next day Generic_Name came home and strolled down the hallway to his room. He came back out and walked over to his mom." Hey mom," Generic_Name said. " What is it Generic_Name do you need help with your homework?" " Well actually mom, I took a flier from the tennis club, I was wondering if you would sign it?" Generic_Name smirked. His moms face lite up and jumped in the air. She grabbed a pen and neatly signed the form like she was about to win the lottery. A few weeks later Generic_Name's mom was sitting on the bleachers cheering for Generic_Name who is working hard on the court. Generic_Name took the last hit and swung his racket as hard as he could. The ball hit the ground and the crowd on the bleachers jumped in the air. " Nice one Generic_Name, you learn so fast!" Generic_Name's friend exclaimed. " Thanks." He gave a smile to his mom who is sitting down and taking in every second.
