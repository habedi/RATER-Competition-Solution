The headline reads: "School Principal Mandates Extracurricular Activity." Most people would not approve of the decision.

Some things wrong with the decision to mandate an activity include busy families, and tired students.

A busy family might not be able to have their students do extracurriculars at school. The principal has no reason to know people take extracurricular activities by forcing them to take a school-based one.

Students might already be taking activities outside of school, so they might have less time to do homework. For example, some students have tutoring to help them in certain subjects. It would be ironic if that time were taken away by the school so that the students could take an activity at school. Next, some students might have a late bus ride that takes a long time and have low-income parents. Forcing them to stay is heartless and cruel because they would take homework time away, and make the parents lose valuable money in turn, by picking the child up.

There also are students who have no sleep, so they need to go home early to rest. With the amount of homework some students have, they deserve to be able to go home.

Sleep deprivation has a lot of negative consequences, including less growth, lower grades, and a worse demeanor. The worst consequence is that it causes a cycle of sleep deprivation because of the student's ability to work is diminished, therefore they stay up late.

In conclusion, the principal made a wrong decision. These consequences for certain groups of people outweigh the benefits of a mandated extracurricular.
