Some know think venus is not a planet. Some know venus is a planet but we all can agree that it is very intresting but why would we use resources to get to venus here are some reasons why and not allow me to show you if it,s worth it. venus is not the farthest planet it is actually not too far so it makes it a viable option. The only thing is is that we have not been able to examine venus with amount of distance between earth and venus which doesn,t give us a lot of options but here is what we do know.

First of all venus is known as earths twin and it,s not called earths twin for no reason. Venus is the same size and density which would make it more acustomed to our way of liveing. sometimes venus is actually even the closest planet so if we timed it right it would make it less the journey. The only things is not a single unmanned ship has not survived for more than a few hours when sent to venus.

Basically this tells us at the moment that mars is a more viable option because we have actually landed unmanned ships on it to collect data this is why many people talk about mars instead of venus. Some problems that get in our way is the air venus has a thick atmosphere 97 percent is carbon dioxide. Not only that but venus atmosphere has highly corrosive acid the eviorment is much more harsh than earth.

This means that it will be a long time before we get to venus are bodies have adapted to earth over the years but it took over 2000 years for us to adapt to this level we can,t wait that long. Our savior nasa is actually coming with ideas to get us there at the moment they have been thinking of makeing blimp like vechile which will hover and fly high to avoid storms and what not. Though it would still be hot but the air pressure is close enough to sea level.

What to expect from nasa in the furture a blimp that might make us be able to get more data from venus. Maybe one day we will be able to inhabit venus with the ideas they are coming up with. The fact of the matter is that it,s going to a long time until we get their. So it seems mars is the better option for now.
