Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME

one of your students here at SCHOOL_NAME and I think that, students who miss behave or don't have any discipline in school or do something really bad to others should do community service because, it will teach them a lesson on how to behave them selves in school and to not do bad things to others. and because, i know nobody doesn't want anybody to miss treat their family or themselves the way they treat others. another reason i think people that don't have discipline should do community service is if they do what they do all the time there is no other reason but to give them community service and if they got kicked out of SCHOOL_NAME or alternative school many times. and plus help cleaning up the community is a good thing to do because ,it helps the earth be cleaner, have us a better planet to live on, and it good to or feel that you know when your doing something nice for others. so thank you TEACHER_NAME for taking your time out to read my letter about why disobedient or discipline kids needs to do community service.

One of your students,

STUDENT_NAME
