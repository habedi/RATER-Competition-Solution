In my paragraphs I'm going to be talking about how Luke convinced other people to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it's an opportunity of a lifetime. Also you can see wonderful things and also tour wonderful places, like Europe and China just like I did. When I joined the program in 1945 World War ll was over and the whole place was ruined (which wasn't very beautiful in my opinion). That is my introduction.

Luke said, "I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime." You can join this program, because it is just full of interesting sites, and places that you could go see and tour just like I did. "The places that I toured was Europe and China" ,says Luke. When Luke went to Europe which was 1945 World War ll was over and the place was left in ruins. You can also find super interesting and people that have fulfilling minds about all the places in Europe.

To support my claim Luke an some other cowboys had an amazing time on board (The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed) says Luke. He had more fun playing games then he did helping the animals. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United Statesand a month to get to China. "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Those are my sentences to support Luke's claim.

In conclusion after reading these paragraphs you think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you can see all the things that maybe you have never saw before. You might have a blast just like Luke did. Luke also played baseball and volleyball with a few cowboys that he hadn't met before you can meet alot of people onboard.(Europe and China was the best tour ever).

Thank you for reading my essay about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, and I hope you join.
