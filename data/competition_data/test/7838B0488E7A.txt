The author explains in the article "The Challenges of Exploring" Venus that studying Venus is a wrothy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. "Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks." (Paragraph 6 lines 6-8) This supports that idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because in the quote it's basically saying that they're thinking about having a mission but they understand the dangers in Venus.

The author has a lot of ideas that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. A lot of his ideas about Venus is that it's the closet planet that is like Earth but there are a lot of problems with Venus. Two dangerous things about Venus is "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." (Paragraph 3 lines 3-6) This means that the surface is way hotter than ours so that would be a major problem and also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than ours which is another major problem. If we lived on a surface that was over 800 degrees than how would we even survive?

Also, "Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good readon, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." (Paragraph 2 lines 7-11) This also supports the claim that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because this tells the reader why a spaceship hasn't touched Venus. The Good things are that "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." (Paragraph 2 lines 1-3) This would mean that we wouldn't have to worry about going to a planet that is way smaller in density and in size than Earth. Also it would mean that whoever would go to Venus wouldn't have to go a long way because Venus is the closest planet to Earth distance wise.

The author did an amazing job supporting the ideas about why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because he gave examples of why Venus could be considered a good or bad planet. The author did this by supporting his claims which is very good. So the author did very well on supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers.
