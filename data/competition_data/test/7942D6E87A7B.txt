Dear principal:

I am writing this because I think that all of the students and maybe some teachers should do some community service. I am asking you to make a speech in front of the school to motivate us to do some community service. I am hoping you will understand why!

First of all, community service gives us the opportunity to commit ourselves to something. We can all do something whether it is picking up trash, volunteering at a hospital or children's center, or tutoring someone. None of these are hard we just have to set our mind on making our community a better place.

We are all capable of doing something, but we decide to not try and do nothing about it. I think this is very important that if we get everyone motivated on doing community service then we will see a change in this community for the better. By doing a few ours after school will make us stronger and we will be a team. This will help us respect each others differences. Also it will give us an opportunity to meet and get to know some other people better.

To me this is going to change the way we look at other people and help us realize we have a lot more than we think we do. The problem is there are some stubborn people in the school that won't want to help that is why we need some inspiration and someone to really motivate us. I am not quite sure how we can motivate everyone. That is why I am asking for help and input from you.

I really hope you take this thought into consideration. You will see a change in our school! It may be hard at first but I know this will work! We will defiantly need some support from others to keep us on our feet and thinking positively! Thank you for you time.

Sincerely, one of your students
