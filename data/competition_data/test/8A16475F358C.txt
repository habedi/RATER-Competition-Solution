A world where people could see the inside of what you are hidding, hidding the emotions that you hide, hiding the look of disgust you do not show , hiding the face of fear you are not willing to let others see, hiding every emotion you do not like. That my fellow friend, is living in world of chaos.

I strongly believe that the value of using this technology will be used by many staff in the school but enjoyed by none, I would have to go against this value for many reaons, one reason is that students will no longer have a filter they will feel the need to go against the system and pretened to be he opposite of what the Facial Coding System reads as a students expression. I also believe that the students will feel very uncomfortable and will not enjoy coming to school anymore. If the teacher really feels the need to get a FACS then I would suggest the teachers step up a knotch with their teaching skills so stduents will not be bored at all.

In the article it says that Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Such as the painting if anyone who looks at the Mona Lisa would see a painted woman just smiling. Looking happier than ever, as if she was sitting in a park on a warm summer day enjoying life, but how would I know that she is truly happy inside? Exactly I do not. I cannot tell if Mona Lisa is happy in this picture but neither can a computer software system.

To the extent of what I have stated I believe that the Facial Action Coding System will not be any value to bring it into schools, I know that a system program cannot tell the emotions you will be expressing. In conclusion this system has no significant value to it. Just as we all have all grown up always remember the saying "Never judge a book by its cover."
