Self driving cars in my opinion is a cool consept and could become succeful in later years but in my eye are technology is not advance enough for this to work out. In my opinion society is still not ready for this type of tehchnology nor are they willing to be wise with it. Self drivin car may help drivers in some way but nothing is perfect including these cars. Kinks in the these car are always going to be present so may be fixable some may not. These problems or kinks could be small or really big. My reasonig are as followed.

Self drivin car are going to be dirvin be technology sensors and a mainframe to recieve this data as talk about in paragraphs 5 but these sensors and computer hardware and software are not gonig to last forever like almost everything it going to break. Lets say this software breaks in the middle of the freeway or while driving through traffic not only do you put your self at risk but the people around you as well. In addition to this, the car will have to be driven manually and is going to have to be fixed and the self driving car will no longer be a self driving car till it is fixed and in my experience with computer software and hardware its not cheep to get it fixed and to imagine getting software that complex fixed is going to come at a high cost. There is also another risk to using this technology, hackers they could hack into your automotive's hardware system and cause many problems on the road. Weather also play a key component the heat could overheat the system, the rain could fry it, cold could freeze it and brake it and etc. Also the cars inablitiy to drive hazardous roads which is inform to us in paragraph 7 means that the switch be autopiolt to manual is going to have to happen this appens in other modes of transportation like airplanes. But given that not all drivers are reasponsible enough to always chhep there eye on the road when they are driving imagine them going at 30 miles per hour not paying attention and the car switches to manual.
