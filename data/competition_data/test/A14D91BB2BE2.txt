Do you believe that schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? In my personal opinion, I think that they shouldnt have to be involved for several reasons. First of all, they already have homework and school assignments that need to be completed. Secondly, some may want to use their extra free time to be involved with friends and work on their socializing skills. Lastly, some students may not have the time nor money to be able to participate in the additional activities.

My first reason to support my claim is that students have homework or class assignment that need to be completed by certain due dates. However, most activities can interfere with getting the assignment in on time. Students need the time for home work so that it doesnt decrease grade even if its a minor change. Additionally, they also need the time to study for up coming test that could affect their GPA or grade majorly. Along with that, 78% of students from middle and high schools have claimed that activities involving with their school work has added on even more stress witch has also caused a lack of sleep. Teacher could build onto that stress by pointing out their bad grades or missing assignments.

To add on to that, students ,preferably teens and preteens, need the extra time away from school to socialize with their friends or peers. If a student is involved with an activity, they may refuse to be with that friend so they can participate witch may cause their friends to quit inviting them places. Scientist have proven that being with a peer that they may enjoy being with; can take their mind away the stress from school or at home. Therefore, if a student isnt getting any socializing time, then that could affect their mental health and could cause the student to be depressed, or inherit anxiety from stressing so much. In 2018, 66% of students stated that being involved with extra activities and schools at once caused them to get depression and that affected their effort in school overall.

Furthermore, some students might not have the time nor money to be able to participate. Many students on social media, have made complaints about how practices or meeting have interfered with family gatherings. Mainly when around Christmas, Thanksgiving, or birthdays. Students also need the time to be with friends and be involved with upcoming events. To add on to this reason, some families may not have enough money for their children to participate in these events. Many activities require the students to own equipment, gear, or special clothing so that they could be involved. The average price for most sports equipment averages from 40$ to 80$ depending on the brand and quality.

You see, Kobe Bryant and other athletes have said that to be involved in sports or any extra activities, you must have the free time to do that. However, students dont have the extra time for that when they already have school work that needs to be done, friends to socialize with, and if they dont have to money for it. Students should be able to control what they can do in their extra free time. Hopefully I have persuaded you to agree with my position in this.
