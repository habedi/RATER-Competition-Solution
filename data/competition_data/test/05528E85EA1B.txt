Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Having students do public community service is a great way for them to share there time to other and the state, to show that they care about what they are living for and what they are capable of doing.

i feel that when people do stuff for the community, they care and that they know that taking the time out of their day to help those who need it, then going to the nails store and getting your precious nails done. As for right now i am on board with people taking little time out of there day and helping the public community it would give them the best of them and help thousands.

Now with that being said, kids and adults should take time off from sports, friends, and other activities that they can take off 10-20 minutes of their time to do a great cause, and help many just for 10-20 minutes its not that long. examples of doing community service is going around and cleaning up scrapes of trash that kids left behind and didn't pick up, or you could donate money to a homeless shelter that would impact a lot, you could do a lot of things and impact a bunch of people and impact the environment.
