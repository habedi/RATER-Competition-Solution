Many Citizens have the advantage of limited car usage, believe it or not. The evidence that has been obtained from the short articles states that by restricting car usage we can reduce pollution in the air. Because of the pollution issue, the Enviromental Protection Agency are promoting "car reduced" communities ( "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the

New York Times

).

Over the past few years there have been an astonishing decrease in car ownership. It seems un-real since transportation is ranked number two largest source of America's emissions. As time goes by, over each year, there has been an obvious considerable amount of Americans buying less cars, driving less, and not to mention, getting fewer licenses. The question is why

?

"It's a good opportunity to take away sress and lower air pollution," said a businessman names Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife ( from "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky, from the

Seattle

Times

). Carlos and his wife ( located in BOGOTA, Colombia ) accepted the idea of not having a car the whole day, which, as he stated, "relaxing". The event of the "Car-free day" started off small in the mid-1990s then over time, bloomed into an event where any, and everyone could join.

There could be many reasons as to why Citizens have the advantage of limited car usage. One reason could be that people can't afford it, another reason could be that they are trying out a new lifestyle to see if it is to the persons need.
