The Electoral college process,is most certainly not a place,Yet it consist of a selection of electors. Throughout time,this process of voting has only failed to work like it should 2 times,Once in 1888,andOnce in 2000. electoral voting is like a process that rules out the popular vote. The electors are the people that make the final decision,Dispite however the popular vote takes place and whoever gets the most majoraty of the votes,The Electoral vote is the most impotant voting process.

The United States Of America states in one very important document,that "We the people",as all the people in one,"in order to form a more perfect union"what does those words mean? Well those words mean that not just Electors should have the say in who is voted president,But everyone should have a say as in who is president in the world that everyone lives in,the popular vote is the best voting process,The origional voting process and that sthe way the voting process should stay that way.

Richard A. Posner states that "it is the electors who elect the president,not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors". that tells you that your not actually voting for the president,that you're voting for electors that vote for the president,They try so hard to trick us,knowing most people are to lazy to stand up and fight for what is right,that they just ru n over us,as in the people. the "Winner- takes all"Method is actually awardoing the electoral votes,induces the candidates.

Bradford plumer stated that even Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole and the U.S Chamber of Commerce,have all agreed that the Electoral college should be abolished!.

'We the people" should have the right to vote for whoever we want becouse we are the people that pay for all of the elector's and the fact that we have to vote for who we take care of is just outragious. the people of the United States should stand up and fight for what is right and for what is fair,We cant just keep sitting back and letting the higher powered peopkle run over us,yes we respect the rules that we are supposed to follow and yes we do what we have to do to survive and live a free and healthy life,but this "Electoral College"needs to come to a end and "We the people" should be able to vote with the popularity voting method.
