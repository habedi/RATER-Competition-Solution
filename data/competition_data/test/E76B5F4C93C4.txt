School is more than just learning information its also about learning important skills for life like responsibility, teamwork, and problem solving. Being able to take classes at home would make it impossible for some students to learn those skills.

Some people may say that having the option to take classes at home would benefit the students because it would give an option for kids who couldnt attend school that day to not fall behind. Many kids will get sick throughout the year or have a reason not to come to school and this would give them a chance to not fall behind.
