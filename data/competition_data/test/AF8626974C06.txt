Dear principal,

If you do that many children won't be able to participate in after school activities, true they will work harder to get in after school activities but some are crucial to their grade therefore lowering their grade thus making it where they can't go thus lowering their grade even more.

Though it might raise the grade students will not like it. You wouldn't like it either if it affected you. The students also need the responsibility it gives them for trying hard on the field if it makes them feel more responsible that will make them work harder. On the field they might be learning more than during school hours like on plays they need to know math to calculate the feet and yard it'll get them so it can raise their math average. In some plays they have long names improving their vocabulary thus helping them in language arts improving their grades. In robotics(for science)

will expand their knowledge for wiring therefore knowing how to make stuff with electricity for projects to help all subjects raising their grade. On the field they have to learn the history of that sport improving their history not necessarily their grade. But the most important reason of all is obesity is the highest problem for American citizens by participating in sports can reduce obesity in our school and state. If you do that our school ,
