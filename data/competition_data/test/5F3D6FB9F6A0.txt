Dear Principal,

I think that you should change the grade average to a B average for students to play spots is because many of the students averages are a C average. If the average changes to a B then students will try harder because most students are involved with sports. If you keep the average the same then students wont try as hard because they know that it doesn't have to be that high of a grade.

I also think that if you change the average some students may not attend sports because they may not feel like they can do it, make a B or better, But it also could give them more self confidence that they can make a better grade. Those students might do better if they really want to do sports and have their mind set on it they will probably have better grades. Well something think bout hope you pick the right decision for the school.

sign, Your Student
