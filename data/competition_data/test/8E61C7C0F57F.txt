Summer break is a time of relief. A stress free vacation for kids who love to relax and not worry about exams, and final papers. A majority of schools allow kids to enjoy summer break, even though, some schools ensure that kids do a summer project to allow them to keep their mind busy throughout the long summer months. Although teachers would not know what the students plans would be, or when they commence, most people say that teachers should design the students summer projects. After all, they know what the student needs to work on, and how to help them if they fail to understand and or, have trouble understanding, and how it will affect them later on in life when they decide to go to collage or the work force.

Teachers know everything about a child academically, they know their strong points while at the same time, helping them strengthen their weak points and their overall success, only thing is, is that the child might have planned something in advance (such as long out of town vacations) and will not have all the time to get it does efficiently and in a timely manner. If kids were to make their own summer project, then they would make it to their appeal, they would make it, to be easy and not challenging their mind. Teachers, on the other hand, would make it fun, critical thinking all in one! Different teachers would also put the specific course too, such as Biology, History ,Algebra I and Algebra II, Geometry, and much more. Who knows, maybe even a language if the student was going abroad. Teachers can come up with special ways make it fun too, especially for science and history. Students can go to a history site and write a paper on how their time was, and what happened on that site. For biology, they can have them go to the zoo and write about what animals they have seen and what type of lands they live in (Grasslands, Deserts, Rain forest ex.)They would also be able to add a checklist to guarantee that the kids understood the topic given. On the plus side, it boosts their grade up for the next school year too, start them up with a outstanding grade.

If a particular student is not doing well in said class or if students were to have a hard time, then the teacher can implement a less challenging project for the kid to their reasonable liking. Instead of them finding it too hard and not accomplishing it, they instead have a sensible feel to it. The student might forget how to do a specific thing or proper procedure or, all together; be to afraid or nervous to ask the teacher for assistance, they are free to ask their parents or other family members to help with the subject. They can even hire a tutor or go to institutes to help them understand the material and help them push forward and reach the extra mile. If the student has been born with a mental illness, such as ADD or ADHD, then the teacher can sit down with them before school ends for the year, and give them extra time and a run down with everything in it to ensure there are less bumps in the road while they are on break.

One far more advanced way it helps is in the long run. Teachers know that high school kids are getting ready to graduate and join the work force or go to collage. They do not want their students to be going into the work force or collage, after having long summers with no work and lollygagging around and being used to not having a care in the world about any sort of paperwork, and go to a more professional job that required a lot of work and paperwork that must be completed within the deadline. Though most kids will not understand until later in life, teachers are trying to give them a feel for what life will become when out of high school. Students will be aware of that upcoming afterwardssand prepare themselves for what lies ahead of their path that they choose. Bosses and Collages like people who know hard work, they like someone who can get the job done efficiently.

There is no reason why, a child cannot complete a summer project. Unless it is for a vacation that takes up all of summer, then they should have partially completed the project It would not take long, students would most likely finish in a week or so. It would be very beneficial to the student that it will get them a better grade at the beginning of the school year, help them improve over all and keep the brain active to the subject, and will help them in the long run with all that life throws at them. One day the students will understand how beneficial it is, most students just think short term, but in reality that tiny bit of information can lead them to fully understanding and memorizing the topic and getting them set up for a lifetime of goals and achievements.
