Also a clear passage for people can ride thier bikes, taking a walk, etc. Another thing s less spending on gas and money to buy cars, and less stress and more safety for everyone. This may end our car culture, but this is for the better for us, and everyone else in this planet.

Second, In paris, they have also enforced a partical driving ban to clear the air of the global city. In France, cold nights and warm days are caused by the warmer layers of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel are to blamed, because France has a tax policy that favor diesel over gasonline, which made up to 67 percent of the vehicles in France comparing to 53.3 percent avaerage of diesel enines in the rest of the Western Europe,Acoording to Reuters.

Last, President obama's goals is to curl the United Staes' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars, drving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will, it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportions is the secong largest source of America's emissions. They also believe to improve safety for others since hoew in the America, car accidents is a biggest issues for the people in United States. This can also help to fix tracffics and clearing up the air.
