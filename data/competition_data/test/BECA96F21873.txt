Dear Principal,

Lately there has been an ongoing debate over sports and grades. You might already know this but I will say it anyways: Most students don't like the idea of having to have a 'B' average in order to be able to participate in sports. And I personally don't blame them. There exist a couple of opinions and I hope that you are ready to hear mine. Personally i don't think that this rule should exists though I understand why it does. Though you might think that I am just saying it because I am like every other student, its nothing of that sort. Here's why:

You might not realize it but kids have a lot to worry about on a daily basis. Especially with things going on at home. Not letting them do sports or extracurricular activities is like taking sleep away from a cat. They need it in order to be able to relax a little and be able to think more clearly. That little time they have off might be what is holding them together. that little competitive effort is what can make them succeed in life.

Which brings me to my next topic. Nowadays what colleges really look for is that you are heavily involved in after school activities.

If you don't they think that you might not get along well with other kids. No matter how good your grades may be. All they worry about is that you are smart and social. If you worry about grades all the time, you loose your social part of you. And you might not be accepted into college because of that.

Most importantly though is that i believe that grades don't depend on what you do outside of school only. They can also depend on the teacher, friends, family, and many other things. You never know if it was because someone died in their family. Or if it is that they are just having a hard time with something. You cannot just assume that it is the sport that's doing this to them. you also have to consider all of the other options in their lives.

I know for a fact that you have a lot on your mind these days. From putting discipline to students, to dealing with teachers and school meetings, so I will only take up a little bit of you time. and that this is just another burden to add to all of that. you might not even be the one who makes the rules. All I am asking though, is that you consider the things that I have told you. At least you could ask to bring it down to the average being a 'C' average since that's what most of us have. it might even motivate us to do better.

You might not think its worth it now but you will agree with it later on. After all aren't kids our future?
