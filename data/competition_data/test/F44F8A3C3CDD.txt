Dear Principal,

I believe not allowing students to bring their cell phone to school is the best police because many student get distracted during classes, they don't finish there work , and they don't pay attention in class their suppose to do.

There are many cases in where a student get distracted in class and doesn't know what the teacher is teaching or talking about most of the time. They have their cell phone in their pockets and they stat texting their friends. At the end when the teacher asks the students question about the lesson many students wont be able to answer the question because their distracted on there phones. They wont be able to understand at all.

The second reason I think you shouldn't allow students to bring there cell phones to school because the majority of the time the students don't finish their work. they find excuses to go to the bathroom and talk on the phone. They tell the teacher many excuses so they wont get a bad grade. At the end of the day they get what they get because of their cell phones.

Many times of the day when a student gets home and they have to do home work they don't know how to do it or how its suppose to be done because they don't pay attention in the class.

They text they get on the internet and the get distracted they didn't pay attention in class so the don't have 100 percent material other students have because the didn't listen to the teacher when she was talking.

in conclusion the best thing to do is to bad cell phones from school and not let kids bring it from home.
