I think having Facial Action Coding systems are a bad idea for students and regular people. I feel that it is a lack of privacy of what you think and that humans shouldnt rely on a piece of technology to change who we are, and as for this technology being for students i really dont think is a good idea at all. The reason why is becuase there could be students that prefer not to talk about there problems and this technology wont help them feel happier or any other emotion. Yes it will see that the person is angry about something but i feel that is not something to be said or written down for the public or teachers to figure out. If the student is ready to talk then the student will talk to you, not only that but thats what can create the bond between the teacher and the student and with that bond the student will learn to trust there teacher more better and for the teacher to trust the student better.

But with this technology, I feel like that would not be a good idea for teacher and student bonding, because then students would have a hard time trusting teachers because of the technology and if anything making student feel like they wont want to talk about there problems or anything at all because of the lack of trust that this technology gives them for teachers to figure out. If you want to know how the student is doing so badly then sit down and talk to the student about whats going on you should not need a device to detect what they are feeling. What would they gain from all that information how the students feel what is that suppose to do to make them happier making this sort of technology is a really big lack of privacy.

In conclusion i think having the Facial Action Coding System is a really bad idea especially for students becuase of the lack of privacy the students will have with there own emotions. Yes this sort of technology can figure out whats on there mind at the time but if the student is ready to talk to you about something then the student will open up to you making a better bond instead of having technology that pretty much forces itself to scan and recognize peoples emotions.
