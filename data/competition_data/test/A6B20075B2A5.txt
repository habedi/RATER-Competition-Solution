Imagine you're drowning, then someone gives you a baby to take care of, it's name is "soccer practice". Some students already have other things to do, they don't need to balance more in their day. A forced school activity is sometimes too much for students who already are not doing so well in school and at home. Why I feel we don't need a mandatory extracurricular activity is for students that take care of siblings, too much homework, and it's stressful.

Taking care of a sibling is hard enough, to put a sports practice on top of that is harder. I take care of my younger brother at home, he is in 6th grade but I still make him do his homework before I can do mine. Adding another activity to my after school day would mean that my brother probably won't do his work until I get home. A mandatory activity would mean me suffering, not sleeping enough because of my brother, then being tired at school, then not doing well at practice and going home to just sleep ignoring my brother, he would be most affected because of this.

Homework is another thing entirely different thing. I mentioned my brother not doing his homework until I get home, but I can't do my homework until he is done. I have to then do my homework later and later, forcing my to sleep less and less, which is definently not good for you. activities push back what is already pushed back. It is also not that fun to do homework at 11 pm.

Stress is something very relevant, most teens experience some degree of stress sometime in school, whether in a project or a speech. while trying to balance school and home life, the added stress of doing well in that sport, club or band can tip students over the "edge". I experience a lot of stress about school, one more thing to worry about might make me go bald at 40.

In reality this plan of a mandatory activity is just too much for me and for my peers. You can think whatever you want about this topic but feel there is no way that plan would have positive feedback. It seems to me like it only causes problems. Now, all I ask is for you to take this into account when talking about this subject.
