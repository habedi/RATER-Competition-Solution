It started when it was not that long ago when it was a rainy day in Generic_City and I was in the hallway heading towards my locker. When I heard my principal say something on the announcements what he said was "that all the students at Generic_School must participate in at least one extracurricular activity" which was not fun. Then a week later I decided to write an essay to my principal explaining the effects his decision had on the students at my school. In the essay I said that I disagreed with his decision because you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do,most people at my don't like participating in extracurricular activities at school,and most people at my school are always busy working or focusing on something that is important to them.

The first reason on why I disagree on my principal's decision is because you can't force someone to do something they don't want to do. An example would be that I was in the school lunch line and i didn't like what they had for lunch so I didn't get anything to eat and I wasn't forced to get a plate when the lunch lady said you should get a plate but I didn't get one so you can't be forced to do something. You can't be forced to join a schools sport or a school club because it is your decision whether you want to join the team or the club. People can't force you to decide on something although they can persuade to decide on something like if you agree or disagree.

The second reason on why I disagree with my principals decision is because most people at Generic_School don't like to participate in clubs and activities. I've realized most people at my school don't like joining clubs is because of they don't feel like they have what it takes to join the club. I've realized we need to change that and boost there self- esteem something that the principal was lowering when he said that all students who attend Glendale high must participate in extracurricular activities. I've also realized that each person is different and unique in there own way, and each person has different interests in things in life.

The third reason in why I disagree in my principals decision is because most people who go to my school are always busy working or focusing on something that is important to them. An example would be that If you had a family member in the hospital you would focus on them being healthy, and them having no problems you would focus on them more than anything because family is important to everyone. Almost everyone who goes to my school focuses on there final exams which is important to everyone if you want to pass that semester or that class. Almost everyone no matter what school you go to focuses on there grades because they don't want to to fail that class or the grade they are in.

I really hope the principal changes his mind about the decision he made because it has negative effects on everyone that goes to my school. It would also take some stress of some off the students who go to my school. Almost everyone who goes to my school would be able to focus on other things, and students would be able to study for there final exams. My principal made a bad decision and then I disagreed on it because almost everyone who goes to my school doesn't like participating in school activities, everyone at my school is busy working or focusing on something or a few things that is important to them, and you also can't be forced to do something you don't want to do.
