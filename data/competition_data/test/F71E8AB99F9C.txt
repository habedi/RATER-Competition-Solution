Dear, Principal

I think we should be allowed to have our cell phones at school during lunch and other free times. But we should have them in our pockets our in our lockers during class time. Also, they should be off, on vibrate, or on silent. If they aren't then the teacher should take the phone and return it to us at the end of the period. The student should get three chances after the third chance their cell phone should be taken and they get it back after school. if this happens three more times then the student should not get the phone back until the students parents come to pick the phone up in the office. That student's phone should not be returned until a parent comes to pick it up. Also, the student will be able to bring back their phone the next day or it will be taken to the office again, and it will not be returned until the parent comes to pick it up. After that the student should know not to bring a cell phone to class anymore and if they do it should be turned off, on vibrate, or on silent.
