The Face on Mars was not created by aliens and we know this because if there was life on Mars we would have seen more evidence of it then just the Face, and there are many Martian mesas in the area where we found the Face so it is most likely to be another mesa with shadows that make it look like a human face. Like the many types of different natural landmarks we have on Earth.

We have taken more pictures of the Face on Mars that don't show any evidence of alien life on Mars. The most recent being the one we took on April 8, 2001 on a camera that takes pictures with better resolution that helps us see more then just the Face but also anything else that could be around the Face, like, pyramids, airplanes, and small shacks. The picture showed something that looked more like the landforms that are common here around the American West. And the picture was take on a cloudless day in Cydonia so it is more clearly seen in the photo.

The Face on Mars is just another landmark like the ones we have on Earth and was not created by aliens because we have more evidence that proves so. Like how if there was alien life on Mars we would have to have seen something that shows that anything could be living there on Mars. The Face on Mars looks more like it has shadows that have made it have the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.
