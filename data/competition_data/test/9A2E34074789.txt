Can a computer system percieve emotions of humans? The software that perseives the emotions of others has improved accurate descriptions of people. The Facial Action Coding System has percieved the emotions of Mona Lisa and has tryed to accuratly grade the percentage of each emoition from the picture. The program bases off of 6 basic emotions which fall in to more complicated catagories. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles no only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them.

The program is going off of the physical emtion but not the mental emotion the person is having. This flaws the percentages overall. Being another individual you can see what the persentages are and agree with them by looking at the picture in person. The mental emotion of someone may be a lot diffrent then what they are expressing physically.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System may be a bit flawed but has improved accuracy quite a lot. Even here is says, according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles no only expresses emotions, but also may help produce them. The system is very accurate when scanning others.
