Dear Ms. Principal,

I know you are having a hard time choosing between two possibilities, but I would recommend letting the children have their cell phones in school. As long as the students do not have their cell phone out during class time, it would be acceptable to have their cell phone during their free time. If the student has their cell phone out during their class time, it should be confiscated. If the students use their cell phones during their lunch time, they will have to put it on vibrate, or silent, so that the whole entire cafeteria will not be very loud because of cell phones ringing. If the students stay after school, would you want them to come the office every single time? Wouldn't that annoy you?

If the students are texting in class, while the teacher is teaching a lesson, their cell phone will be confiscated. If they do not give their cell phone to the teacher, they will either be sent to the office or the teacher will have the you, the principal, to come and get it yourself. Since their teacher will give the cell phone to you, the principal, the owner of the cell phone will have to have their parents come pick it up after school. The parents will want to hear a reason why they had to come pick up their child's cell phone, and the student will have to explain to their parents. The children will get in trouble by their parents too.

During lunch time, the students will be able to use their cell phones. If they use it, they will have to put it on vibrate or silent because the teachers do not want to hear more than a hundred cell phones going off. If their cell phone is not on silent or vibrate, a teacher will announce in front of everyone in the cafeteria whose cell phone went off. Whoever's cell phone rang, would be very embarrassed because everybody knew that it was not a good thing to have your name called out in a public area. In a student's point of view, I would be so embarrassed because all of my friends would be watching and all of the popular kids would be watching. If I saw somebody whose name was called in front of the whole cafeteria, I would feel very bad for them.

Every school has after school activities. So that means more students will be using their cell phones to call their parents. That would be a very big relief for the secretary's in the office. If all of the students stayed after school came to the main office, just to call their parents to tell them to pick them up, it would be chaos. The secretaries in the office will go crazy! So many people would be outside the main office just waiting to use the phone. I would feel really bad for the secretaries. They would have to stand the chaos in the office at that time. If I was a secretary, I would want a raise or I would want to quit. The secretaries in the office are very important because they notify everyone in the school if there is something important to announce.

All of the students will know the consequences of using their cell phone during the wrong time. They wouldn't want that to happen to them I would want to have my cell phone in school so that I wouldn't have the use the office phone every single day. Having a cell phone is a very good benefit when you are at school. If something sudden happens, you would be able to contact your parents in emergency.

Your Student in 8th Grade,
