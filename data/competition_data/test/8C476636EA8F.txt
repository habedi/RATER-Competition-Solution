Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that kids should not be able to use there phones during school because of many reasons such as, not paying attention in class. Also if kids are aloud to use the phone during a free time might encourage them to use it in class. kids would get into lots more trouble with teachers if they use there phone in class.

First, kids should not be able to use there phone in class because, they will not pay attention in class. If kids are not paying attention in class then kids knowledge is not growing. We really need a smarter generation to help stop important stuff. Like someone in my generation could find a cure for cancer and become rich and successful. Someone in my generation could help the economy and things could be more affordable. also people could be not in debt. That is me first reason kids should not use there phones in school.

Second, If we have a free period of time were we can use are phones then that would cause trouble to because, since there phones are in there pockets it encourages them to use it in class. Also kids are not getting any smarter texting all the time. Soon kids will be using texting in there school reports and start to fail. That is my second reason why kids should not use there phones in school.

Finally, kids would start to fail there classes because, kids would start to into there texting and also calling people. Also kids would start to cheat on test by using there phones in class and getting answers from people. Soon kids would start to get caught and get into lots of trouble.

That is why I think phones should not be used in school.
