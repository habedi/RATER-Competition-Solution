I had so much fun being in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I would tell anyone to try it, and I am going to tell you why it is such a great thing to do.

First, you get to help others in need. It was felt amazing being able to help those who were hurt in the war. I also got to visit beautiful Europe and China. It was unbelieveable too seing the Acropolis in Greece. Taking a gondola ride over wonderful Venice, Italy was breathtaking. I also had a tour through a castle, how great is that? I was also marveled by the Panama Canal on my way to China.

If you enjoy animals, you'd love this job. While on the two week trip crossing the Atlantic, the animals kept me very busy. I got to feed and give water to them about two or three times a day. But, stalls had to be cleaned.

It was always fun on board, especially on return trips because I got to play baseball and volleyball, which were held in the empty animal holds. We did many other activities, like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games.

Mainly, this experience made me more aware of people of other countries. This awareness even lead to my family generously hosting some international exchange students.

The Seagoing Cowboys is an amazing program. There a many reasons why I believe this, and I tried to list most of them. If you do not try this fun, great, wonderful thing, then you're missing out.
