Dear Principal,

I think the first policy you are considering is better than the other one. However I do think it might or might not cause trouble. The only reason I would use my phone during school is to text my parents telling them if I'm riding the bus or not. Kids use their phones a lot. So that could also mean that some kids are going to text each other during these free periods. They already text during class anyway. Having the phones turned off during class might not work because to enforce that rule, the teachers would have to make sure each and every phone is off, and this could take up class time. Besides, kids would probably turn them right back on as soon as the teacher turns their back. But, I agree with this policy because like I said, some kids might have to tell their parents something. If we couldn't have phones, we would have no way of communicating with our parents, and we might get stranded at school, then Mom gets worried and calls the police, then an entire search goes on just to find that one kid sitting there at the front of their school. Cell phones have become a natural part of out life, so taking them away would almost be like taking away one of our limbs for the day, and that's an important limb too. But even if you do go with your second policy, there's no guarantee that kids won't bring their phone to school. I mean, already we're not supposed to have them, but every kid brings them anyway. Regardless if they have to talk to their parents or not. However if you did let us have our phones out, even for that little half an hour at lunch, it could make all the difference. Kids might actually be happier at school knowing they're allowed to have their phones. I think kids might feel restricted by not being able to use that little part of their life at school, where they are a majority of the time. Kids in a way need their phones.
