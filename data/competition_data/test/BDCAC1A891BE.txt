Dear Principal,

I don't think this is a good idea, because some students really do try their hardest but it just doesn't come to them that easy. If they do try their hardest and they really do put their effort into all their work and they don't get that B average they can't play the sport(s) they love. If they don't put any effort into their school work and they just come to play the sports, then i can see your point.

It reminds me of me, because i do try but school doesn't come easy to me, and i love to play my sports. I'm a C average girl. If we had this policy i wouldn't be able to play all the sports i love.

I get what you mean by this policy, but i don't think this is fair for the people who try really hard but just don't get the grades they would need to play. What if you go to this after school math or science thing? If you don't have the grades you wouldn't be able to go to those without a B average. Some people go to learn more about whatever subject there going to learn about. So if they had lower then a B average they wouldn't be able to go learn about the subject there staying after to learn. If they stayed after to learn it, they could do better in that class, but they cant do activities after school without that B average.

Thanks,
