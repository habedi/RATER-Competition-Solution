The "Face on Mars" is a natural landform. Many critics think that it is a sign of life on Mars. The Face was discovered in 1976. Since then it has become a pop icon. Appearing in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. This natural ladscape is simply a Martian mesa.

The Face is a Martian mesa."What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."(12) The comparing and contrasting of the Face and a natural lanscape on earth shows that Garwin know what he is talking about."It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."(12) Scientist figure it was just another Martian mesa, but only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."(5) The NASA would certainly take credit for finding alien activity on Mars. The finding wouldn't only be an advantage but it would reward fairly. If the NASA had intended to hide the discovery, they would not have shared it in the first place.

People do have reason to oppose this argument otherwise. The "Face on Mars" does look like alien activity. "...wich resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."(3)

Therefore the "Face on Mars" is simply a natural landform. NASA would not keep this from the world. It is simply a Martian mesa.
