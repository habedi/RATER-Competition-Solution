Cell Phones and Vehicles

In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones at all while in a vehicle. I think this, because even with these new cell phone laws some people still use their cell phones while driving. So with these laws it should make the chance of accidents less possible, and police can write tickets so people are less likely to do it again. Now, all new cars are able to have bluetooth and touch screen and unless you have a very old car that shouldn't be an issue anymore.

However, the reality is, most of the drivers are still using cell phones while driving and I guess it's not that easy for the police to catch them.

With bluetooth you just swipe to pick up a phone call and automatically connect to your car nowadays. Many people tend to think it's not a big deal to just swipe -it takes only a second. I do think so as well. That one second could cost you a life or somebody's life.

What can stop drivers' using cell phones while driving?

The simplest but most difficult is each driver has a strong will not to touch the phone during driving. Police can set more camera (not only at the traffic lights but on normal roads) so that cameras can catch drivers who are using the phones. Once "Restriction on cell phones while driving" law becomes nationwide, cell phones should be made to get disabled near the driving seat once car starts moving.

I will follow the law once I start driving and hope all the drivers consider about the risk of using the cell phone while driving.
