Driverless cars are coming! Google cofounder Sergey Brin thinks that there will come a time when nobody will buy cars because they wont need them. He believes that the cars would be like taxi systems and take us wherever we would need to go. Google has had cars that can drive independently under specific conditions since 2009, but is this a good thing?

I myself believe that driverless cars could be a good and bad thing. Self independant cars would be able to help people out big time. For those who travel, they wouldn't have to stop and get a hotel because if they were tired the car would just drive them while they rest. Many people also do illegle things while driving, like talk on the phone or text. People crash cars all the time for drinking and driveing, texting, and talking on the phone. Having a car that would drive you would lower the accidents casued by these things. Having a car that drove you would save many lives. Haveing cars that would drive themselves would put many people out of jobs. Taxi services, truck driving services, limo drivers they would all get replaced by vehicals that could drive on their own. Also what if self driving cars got into a wreck? Whos at fault for that? The driver or the company that made the car and led you the buyer to belive you would be safe inside of it. How would anyone get justice out of that, they wouldn't.

Now, I believe that there is both good and bad in having driverless cars, but if they were designed properly and taken care of they way they should be, I think that they would help out majorly. People that have ideas for the future have a lot of responsibility on them. They have to make sure that their ideas are of the better good before they let them out into the world. I hope whoever does designe these driverless cars put thought into it rather than just thinking about money.
