In "The Challange of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers presents. The author defends his idea by stating that Venus is like Earth in ways such as its size and density, current landscape, and the environment Venus possibly housed in the past.

One way that the author thinks that Venus should be furher explored is that Venus is how similar Venus' terrain is to Earth's. Currently Venus has valleys, mountains, and craters atop a surface of rocky sediment like Earth. Theoretically in the past Venus' surface was covered witn large oceans for the most part. These conditions made it possible for life forms to grow there.

Another piece of information used is that despite the dangers on Venus expeditions can both be safely carried out and fruitful. Various technologies are being created and innovated for Venus' harsh environments. In the cirsumstance that scientists are stationed at Venus they will be equipped with blimp-like vehicles so that they may envade the storms that are near ground level. Even with these safer ways of navigation collecting material data such as rock or gas would not be possible. Another solution to this problem has been intoduced. Simple electronics made out of silicon carbide have been tested in simulation spaces similar to Venus' comditions and environment. Scientists are also proposing that mechanical computer are used to collect dataon Venus. These computers are much more hardy then their modern-day cousins.

In conclusion with these innovations the author belives that Venus' exploration would be a worthwhile puruit despite the challanges becuase obviously a large amount of information can be found there. Not to mention there are solutions to some of the problems that would arise while exploring Venus.
