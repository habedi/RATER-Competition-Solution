If I were a scienctist I would tell people its not a face, its a landform and that its a shadow that makes it look like a face. When the photographers took a picture of it, it was as soon as possible. Plus the camera was at its absolute maximum and so u can obviously tell it is a shadow that makes a face. What the picture really shows is the Maritan the same as a butte or mesa land form which is common around the American West. If there were a peron on Cydonia we would be rich finding the greatest discovery of all time. why not have more then just a man lets have a whole colony right?

When Michael Malin flew over it the team got a picture Ten times sharper then the first picture and when people on the internet who just couldnt wait to see what it was guess what they found out it was? A natural landform there is no alien monument after all. There is absolutly no aliens at all at least not that we have found.
