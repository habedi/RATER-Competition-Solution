I do not think that driverless cars shoild be made because it is highly dangerous and I just dont belive that there is enoughtechnology for that. Plus I belive that it is unecessary because for years cars have been driven manualy why try to change that now.

On top of all those things the cars are still not even really driverless the car still needs a human to pull in and out of driveways. Why is having a driverless car even necessary? Cars dont need food or groceries and it doesnt have childreen. In reality there will probally not ever be a true driverless car it is meant to have a human behind the wheel. The driverless car can only go up 25mph. That is going to create lots of traffic. If somone is in a rush such as very sick and needs to go to the hospital and theres a bunch of driverless cars going only 25mph then there are going to be a bunch of crashes.

And to top it all off everyone is not sure if it is even legal to create these driverless cars. It is not safe to have drivers less cars because anything can go wrong when no ones behind the wheel. There is only limited use. So if there is only limeted use then that means that there is not much time to work on the driverless cars. They are just simply not safe.
