I think they should change the electoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect president. Your states entitled allotment of electors equals the # of members in its congressional delegation: one for each member of the House of Representatives plus 2 Senators. Each canidate running for president has his/her own group of electors. They are chosen by the canidate's political party, but state laws vary on how they're selected and what their responsibilities are. The presidential election is held every 4 years. Most states have a "winner-take-all" system that awards all electors to the winning of the presidential canidate. In the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. The electoral is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.
