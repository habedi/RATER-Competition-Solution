Dear principle whatever-your-name-is,

I disagree with this new policy. Having this policy in effect can only cause trouble and revolt. The students will not like this and I think they are well justified.

This policy only hurts students because it makes them feel like they are being singled out for punishment. Some students wrap their whole lives around sports and if these are taken away from them then they feel like there's no reason to try anymore.

For some students sports are a stress reliever. Some students can be stressed out from having to spend all day cooped up in a classroom. Some of them may turn to sports as a way to relieve some of that energy.

For some students spending time in sports is a way to get away from a troubled household. Some of your students may get verbally or physically abused. Sports may be their way to stay away from home for as long as they can or to just have a safe haven where they don't have to worry about their safety or the safety of family members.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
