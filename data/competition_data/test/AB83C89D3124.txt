As a high school student, school is very stressful to me. A big part of that stress has to do with big projects and tests that we have to do and take during school. The summer is our time to get off of school and take a break from learning but that would make it so much harder to get back to our normal routines when school rolls around again. Summer projects are the answer! The only thing wrong with them is that they don't engage the students because we aren't in the mood to do boring school work during our summer vacation. School projects done in the summer should be student-designed to increase willingness to participate, make students think creativley, and give the teachers a break from doing extra work over the summer.

If summer projects were student-designed, students would be more willing to participate. When a teacher designs a project, students usually become bored and annoyed, while also dreading to do the work. If a student designed their own project, the work would be less boring and more fun. This would increase the students willingness to participate by giving them a project that they designed to fit to their likings.

Student-designed summer projects would not only make the students use their brain when they are doing the project, but also make them use their brain while they are making it. The making of the project is a project in itself. This will force students to think creativley and use their minds. They will also be pushed into creating something they actually think is interesting as they will be the ones participating in it.

Teachers, especially in high school, do so much planning throughout the year. If students took the time to design a project that would not only benefit the students, but it would give the teachers a break over their summer. All teachers would have to do is approve their students project and grade it. This would make add another pro to the column for student-designed projects as it would not only benefit the students, but the teachers as well.

Student-designed summer projects have an overall benefit from teachers to students. They make students want to actually do the work, make the teachers life easier, and make the students use a more creative side of them. Although no student would like to do school work on their summer vacation, this is the best most efficient way to make them want to do it. Students will no longer start to dread projects if this is how they will be assigned. Student-designed summer projects are the best way to make this process easiest for everyone involved!
