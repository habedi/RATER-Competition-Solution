I personally believe that while this technology is great, it will likely not be useful in the average classroom.

Right now, the cost of this program is just too much. Consumer PCs are not equipped to run it, which is a huge limiting factor. Next is the set up. You can't just have a single PC running it, you would need multiple due to how many kids there would be in one class. Finally, there would be so much work needed to help code in such a complex lesson for classes. Making lessons for school is tough and boring work now, imagine having to make every possible outcome for one lesson every time you wanted to teach. It would be extremely difficult.

Now don't get me wrong, this technology could be used to great extent in other fields, I just believe that now is not a good time to implement that into classrooms everywhere. It would be better to test it on a smaller scale before releasing the program. Perhaps you could test it inside of one school, or inside of one class to see how effective this would even be at getting these bored students engaged again. Because in the end, that's what its about, keeping the students engaged.

If they want to use this technology in the class, they really have to zero it in as to what it will be used for. Dr. Huang said that the program can be used to detect when a student is becoming bored or confused with a lesson, and the lesson can modify itself to help like a human instructor. But thats it, we can just have a human instructor! There's no need for that right now. I'm not saying there's no possible application in the future, I'm just saying we have a solution to this problem, and we've been using it for as long schools have existed.
