I think that every student should precipitate in something at school. This is a great idea because students could get more involved in school and they can always know whats going on. They could precipitate in things like sports, clubs, and just any other extracurricular activity. This activity does not have to be any everyday thing. It could be once every week or every other day.

I think every student should precipitate in a sport or a club because it lead them to learning new things. Or it could open up new opportunities for them. Many students may not like this idea because school is already enough for them and they can't handle doing a sport or be in a club. I understand that but thats why all the clubs don't have to be school related. School can be very stressful and sometimes we need a break. So having these clubs during the middle of the day could impact how a lot of students preform in school. It could be a nice way to relax and get your mind off of the work you have to do but you would still be learning in a way.

This idea could also help build relationships, make new friends, and meet new people. At school on a daily basis you probably talk to the same people. If you are in a club or in a sport you would be able to meet new people and possibly expand your friend group. If you do not want to make new friends this is a great way to get closer with your friends because you would spend more time together and you would be learning together.

This could also make students find new intrest or hobbies. These intrest could end up being something they want to study in college. This idea is a good way for students to explore new things.

I know that not many students like this idea because they might think that its a waist of time or maybe they can't find a club that their intrested in. This could lead to them making their own club. So every student has a chance to be in a club or sport.

This is a great idea and I think it should be put into play.
