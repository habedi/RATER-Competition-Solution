Cell Phone Use While Driving

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using any kind of possibly distracting technology while operating a vehicle can put the driver, and others, at serious risk. Many people do not fully understand the risks that come with using a cell phone while operating a vehicle. While distracted driving they could hit someone or something, possibly leaving the the driver and that person or thing seriously injured, damaged, or dead. These are just a few reasons for why drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In 2015, the NSC estimated that cell phone use while driving, alone, accounted for 27% of all car crashes in the United States and 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities. Also in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 310,000 people injured in accidents involving distracted driving. In the U.S. nine people are killed each day from distracted driving. Car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.S. This distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. These statistics rise every year. And with technological advances in cars, radios, phones, etc., there are many things that can easily distract any driver. Drivers should keep in mind that it is okay to leave a text unread for a couple of minutes in order to safely respond when the vehicle is stopped and off the road. Or pull over if it is important to respond quickly. There is rarely an emergency so severe and emergent that a person would need to put themselves and others at risk of serious injury or even death, because if something happens to that person, they can not help in an emergency situation anyway.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is extremely dangerous and risky. Drivers are not only putting them self in harm's way when using a cell phone while driving, but they are also putting other's lives and safety on the line. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.
