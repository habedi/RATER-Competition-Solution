Dear principal,

I think that students need to participate in sports activities because if the students don't participate they would become lazy, and fat. There would only a little bit of kids at the activities because most of the students have C average. School activities are fun but try to get a B average is pretty hard because the students might have trouble with a subject and that's what keeps them from doing school activities. The students might be scary of asking a teacher for help because there scary that the teacher might yell at them or the teacher is mad and don't want to ask him/her. They might be getting a C average because the teachers gives them to much homework or project.

Homework are due the next day but project are due like a week. The students are getting a C average because they might have lots of homework from each teacher. I have four teachers because one for each subject. I have found that having four teachers are hard. The students might have trouble because its the people they sit in class. There friends are one of them bully or there sitting in back and cant see the front.

by your student,
