"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa -- landforms common around the American West.

"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin.

"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heightas the Face on Mars".

That information was from the artical "Unmasking the Face on Mars".

After reading all the information in the artical "Unmasking the Face on Mars" I don't think that aliens made the face on Mars, I think that it is just a natural landform.

The reason I think it is just a natural landform is because ,all the information I read has convinced me that the Face on Mars was made out of rocks and big mounds of dirt, the shadows on them make it look like a face.

"Thousands of anixous web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.

There was no alien monument after all."

Another reason is because I don't think aleins are real.

My whole life I have been told that aleins are not real, and that we are the only living things in our univerce.

This is what I think the Face is made out of and why it looks like a face.
