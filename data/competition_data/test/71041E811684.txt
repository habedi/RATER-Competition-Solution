I always said to myself "if I had the chance to student-design a project for school it was going to be unique". I know that may sound weird but it's true i'm kinda a nerd when it comes to those type of things. Sophomore year was that year for me! When my flex teacher Generic_Name told the class about the student-design project and that the project had to involve something that you liked to do. I was so excited, my head could have explode like a airhead. My project was going to be that I made myself a homemade Manikin head and to style the hair. I loved doing hair that is what made this whole project unique. I wonder what other students would choose to do if their school required them to do a student-design project. The statement that some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is true;these projects should be student-designed because students will show how creative they can be in a learning aspect and more students may actually participate in the summer project assignment.

When students think project they tend to think that it is going to be something fun and interesting they are going to have to do. Having a student-designed summer project allows for students to use their creativity in a learning aspect. For example, I used my creativity in a learning matter when I got to do my self-designed project assignment. It was a interesting time completing because I had to use my creativity by showing something I liked to do in a learning aspect. That allowed me to bring in math and science to complete the whole project, Therefore, giving a student a student-designed summer project would allow for students to use their creativity in a learning aspect.

When students are given summer projects to have completed by the beginning of the following school year the assignment may just be forgotten about or many students will not even try to complete the assignment. Imagine giving students a self-designed summer project, this will allow for more students to actually participate in the summer assignment. In the summer students do not think about school almost at all. So, if students are given a student-designed summer project there will be more students completing the assignment. They get to follow their own rules. For example, when students are told how to do something they have a hard time doing it. when they are told to do something and make it their own they are more excited to finish the assignment and get it turned in.

Furthermore, giving a student a student-designed summer project would allow for more students to actually participate and complete the assignment.

In conclusion, When schools give out required summer projects they should be student-designed because students will show how creative they can be in a learning aspect and more students may actually participate in the summer assignment. Other students may think that teacher-designed projects are a better way of assigning summer project for the fact it may be more organized. This would allow for teachers to know what to expect when it is time for the students to turn in the project. Do not get me wrong I still feel that students should be allowed to self-design there own project in the summer. Am I saying that because i'm a student? Yes I am because I know if all the projects I got assigned were student-designed I would be the first to turn them in!
