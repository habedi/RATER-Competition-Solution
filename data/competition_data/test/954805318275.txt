Dear Principle,

I for one have never been a big part of participating in sports to be quite honest with you. My grades have always been one of my top prorites as a student. I have lived my whole life watching people play sports and other activities and how that effects them as a human being so to tell you the truth I think that your new " B average only" scenario is absurd. Now hold on a minute, I'm not trying to be rude but just wait and hear my side of the story.

I think that if you took this B average policy into action that it would anger the student body as a whole. While I do understand that sometimes you have to do things that people wont necessarily agree with you have to side with the student body sometimes too because they have to respect you. You will turn already rebellious students into ones that come into your nightmares.

First let me tell you what taking away sports to those children would to. Most importantly some children just aren't well how do I put this nicely, the smartest children out there. I'm not trying to be mean but sometimes no matter how hard a student tries to do there work they just do not grasp the material enough to comprehend it resulting in poor grades. Even if they do not excel in school they may do better in other areas such as sports or the arts. If you took away these kids rights away to sports just because they don't get the information that would be like denying a child food because it misbehaved.

Sports also play a big part in our health. Did you know that studies show that 1/3 of all children from Massachusetts are obese? When I heard that it made me think of what this country is doing to its children that we are the way we are today. Sports keep us healthy and only a moron wouldn't be able to see that clearly. If we want to improve the health of this state, if we want to improve the health of this nation we have to start adding more daily activity to a child's life. I'm not even a sports sort of person but to take away sports just based on grades alone would be like taking a step back in the process to make the children of America healthy.

Today's teenagers live in a society that is basically based off our stereotypes and while I do understand that this is not necessarily true in some places, for the commen teen this is a rule of life. We are placed in our little packages and labeled as nerd, jock, and the artsy types among other groups of people. I'm not saying I agree to this because as far as labeling people goes because I don't but you have to understand that to some people this label is who they are, its almost become their way of life and you would just make them rebel if you took that privilege away from them.

I know that you see education as something important and I for one see it the same way but sometimes people are in such a different mind set that you cant change the way they view things no matter how much you try to. People one day might want careers outside of academia so you have to give them that option as well, to embrace what they are good at and love to do. I think that as long as the student isn't in D or F range for their over all grade that they should be allowed to participate in these school activities. You have to draw a line somewhere but drawing the line with C range students is not the place to draw such a line.

Your the principle but think about how you grew up? Was there ever something that was your passion to do other than school work? That's how it is for some of these kids but however more intense. For some its the way they live. High School and Middle School are places where you have to find who you want to be and taking away sports and other activities would be like denying them of that chance. So Mr. Principle put yourself in our shoes, our poor confused shoes that are still trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives. We need this policy to stay out of our school system because not only will you have rebellion, a higher chance of obese children, but your C students will have lost their identity in a way. I always said that I wanted to make a difference, to stand up for what I believed in, and this is me doing so.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME Grade 8
