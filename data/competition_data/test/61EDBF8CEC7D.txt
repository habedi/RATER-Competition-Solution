Do you get boerd being at home all the time? Well, imagine having to go home and take classes online. Some say, students benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video confrencing. On the otherhand, others suggest that students taking classes online can cause lot's of distraction, being anti-social, and giving an oppurtunity to cheat on a subject without getting true help, and support from a teacher in school.

We all like being on social media and communicating with our friends and family whenever we have the chance. But, texting your freinds and trying to do your work at the same time can be a huge distraction. However, if a student is giving an advantage to take classes online, it will cause a student to get off task and go on their phone without having the right discipline like a regualr school would have.

In a regular school, students would have the oppurtunity to communicate with their peers. For example, if a teacher assigned a project for the class and told them they are able to work in groups. This wouldn't only count as a grade but, being able to be social with your classmates and not being able to do the work independently. Which is a great idea so that it wouldn't cause a student to be ant-social.

Finally, giving a student the advantage to take classes online will give them the idea of going to a different website and finding the answers to the question. Ironically, that's what a student would do if they had the chance to. But, would it be helpful to ask for guidence, from someone who can actually give you some ways to help make you understand the topic. Not being able to get that type of help can be stressful and cause you to cheat.

In conclusion, taking classes online isn't a bad idea if wanting to finish school faster. But, it can also cause you to get distracted , anti-social, and not having the ability to get proper help when struggling with a specific topic.
