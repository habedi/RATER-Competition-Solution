The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The problem with this is that not all classrooms have computers. This new technology would only get used every time computers are used, so the FACS wouldn't get much use. That is why I think this technology is not very valuable in a classroom.

The article states in paragraph one that FACS was developed to help humans and computers communicate. Then, in paragraph five, the article says that humans read each other's facial expressions all the time. I do not think that humans need computers to read each other's emotions if we already do it so well.

Another point to my argument is that the computer may not be able to read people's correct emotions. For example, there is no definite way of knowing Mona Lisa's emotions in her painting. Just because a computer says what her emotions are, doesn't mean that it is right. She may have been happy, she may have been faking; we simply have no way of knowing for sure.

The last point to my argument is using technology to read our emotions. Most teachers don't allow students to use electronics in the classroom. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang says, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,". To me, a student's learning is more important than them being entertained. Now, being confused is an entirely different thing. If a student is confused they should ask the teacher to explain so that they do understand.

I think this technology is not very valuable in a classroom. My biggest issue with this is the tech being faulty. If humans can read each other's emotions without much difficulty, I don't see why computers need to be able to read them as well. I don't see how that benefits anyone.
