Dear principal,

I know you want all the student to help our community, but i believe that the students hear have to much work on their hands right now. Our finals are in a week and we need all the time we can get to study. Yes, I think helping the community is an amazing idea. But on the other hand, don't you think students will love to go to college some day? Think about it, if we spend time tutoring children and cleaning up litter when are the students going to be able to study? Time is valuable! We can't just waste it. We help the community when we get older and get a job. For example, a doctor helps injured people and the president of the United States helps our nation to be safer more educational place for the people. We can't become a doctor, police officer, or president of the United States without going to college and getting our degree! In the future, when we are responsible adults, it would be best to help out our community. Right now we are young and we need the time we have to grow up and get a great education to become a responsible adult. Even if you still make us do community service the student will not do as they are told. Sadly, it's the truth. Most of the students hear are more committed to do great in school then go pick up garbage from the street. As you can see, the students can't be forced to help our community. The best we can do is go to school and learn. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and I hope you make the right choice.
