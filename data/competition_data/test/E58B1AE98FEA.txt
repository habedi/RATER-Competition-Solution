Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I agree with policy one, which states that students would be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. This is the better policy because it would make students more happy and able to have their free time to the maximum. I think that if you went with policy two then students would be very unhappy.

One reason why you should use policy one is because students would support you more because they would be happy and would agree with more of your decisions. Like if you decided to change another rule then students would not be afraid to state their opinion.

Another reason is that instead of not liking school then students would want to come to school because they would get to have more fun. Their free time would be filled with more excitement and the students would be happier. I'm pretty sure you want happy students at your school right?

A third reason is that students would be more connected at school than they were before. Teachers and administrators are always saying that we need to be more connected because we are eighth graders going into high school next year. This would make us students even more connected than we already are.

In conclusion, I agree with policy one because it would make students happier and be able to fulfill their free time to the maximum. I think that policy two would make students unhappy and they wouldn't want to come to school as much.

Sincerely,

An eighth grade student
