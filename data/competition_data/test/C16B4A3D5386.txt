Imagine a town where the streets are empty of cars and stores and shops are just a walk down main street.  Well that town exists, its called Vauban, Germany a town on the border of the swiss and france.  People who live there gave up their cars and now live a different type of life.  Most people who have done this are happy they can just walk to places.  Back in the 50's this would be the town to live in.  It still has a strong appeal to people.  The way it is run makes it one of the most intresting town in europe.

This plan worked for them why cant we do this in Bradenton?  Now this type of town would benifet anyone.  People would save money.  The town or city would make double or even more of what they are making in public transportation.  The enviornmet would get healthy and make any town less polluted and help in the fight of greenhouse gases.

We all know how expensive gas can be and how it goes up and down.  With cars being took out the only thing we'd need gas for is buses that would transport us.  Our wallets will thank us and so will the planet.

Speaking of the planet greenhouse gases are the talk of the town and will not stop unless we do spmething.  We can help by doing this plan.  We can never undo what we have done to the ozone layer.  However we can certainly not make it worse by doing this.  In fact we could cut down pollution and make bradenton the city it once was.
