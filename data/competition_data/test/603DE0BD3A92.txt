Dear principal this new policy that you have made is not right. some of our best athletes have a C average so by making the eligible grades higher to a B average you will be destroying our sports program. If you chose to fallow your policy then the whole sport program and all the school are going on a strike. We the students will stop making good grades.

By dropping our grades than we will make the school look bad. you will be the one affected because you are the one incharged of the students doing good and not dropping their grades. After dropping our grades you still decide to fallow your policy then we will slowly stop coming to school. We will all transfer out of the school and attend another school that has a sport C eligible program. Also if there is a low number of students that are coming to the school than the school board will have to shut the school down. After the school shuts down then you will have to lose your job. After you lose your job the students will beg the school board to reopen the school just with a different principal that is under a condition of not l higher the eligible average.

So that as long as your passing all your classes with at least C average then you can be participating in any sport you feel like playing.
