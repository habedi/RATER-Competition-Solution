In my opinion, if students are required to do school work during the summer, they should at least get to choose the topic of their project. I believe this because students have to take time out of their summer to create the project. Also, it could be more enjoyable for the students, if they created it on a topic theyre interested in. However, participating in a project may be stressful to most students if a teacher designed it.

Firstly, if students are assigned a project during their summer break, then they should at least have a choice on what their project is about. I believe this because students have to take the time out of their summer and create a project. In my belief, this unfair to the students and is time consuming. A project may take many hours out of a students day because of how long it may take to create one. For instance, if a teacher designed a project, it may be difficult for students to understand. Instead, if a student designed their own project, it may save time and be easier to complete.

Secondly, if student's design their own projects, then it may be more enjoyable for them. For instance, if student's were able to choose the topic of their project, then it may be easier to complete. In result, student's may find this more amusing, rather than a teacher designing their project. Also, student's may be more creative and passionate towards their work. Overall, their project may be more eventful if student's are doing it on something they chose

Thirdly, student's may encounter stress. Student's may encounter stress during a project if they feel restricted to one idea. For example, if a teacher designed a project, it may be difficult for student's to understand their teacher's point of view. However, if a student created their own design, then it most likely wouldÂ be easier for the student's. Overall, stress levels may increase if student's dont understand their teacher, yet if student's have a variety of options to choose from, their project may be more amusing.

However, from a teacher's point of view, a teacher designed project may seem easier for student's. For instance, a teacher may believe a teacher designed project may be easier for student's since their is topic already portrayed.

Also, teacher's may believe their project design is fun and intriguing to student's. However, i assume teacher's try to plan amusing project design's, but students opinions may differ. Overall, teacher's may try to make it easier for student's by giving a design, but instead it may increase stress for srudent's.

In conclusion, I believe summer projects should be student designed instead of teacher designed. In my opinon, teacher designed projects may take a great amount of time. Also, it may not be as enjoyable. However, students may feel restricted to one idea/topic. Lastly, students may feel stressed or overwhelmed by a teacher designed project.
