Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death. The biggest age group affected by this problem would have to be teens aging from 16 up to adults aging around 30. In the end, no one benefits from this problem other than the law enforcement team who has worked so hard to stress the importance of no texting while driving and funeral homes that are being paid for burial expenses. The reason I say that the law enforcement benefit from the problem would have to be because this is an example of exactly what it is that they try so hard to avoid. Funeral homes benefit because most of these cases end in a tragic accident that allow the funeral home to prepare a home going ceremony. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person continue to text and drive. People really need to understand how easily it is take the life of someone else or even themselves. And most of the time in many cases relating to this particular problem, it is always is the age groups ranging from 16 years of age to 30 years of age. I wish that this problem can get resolved quickly to avoid many accidents and death.
