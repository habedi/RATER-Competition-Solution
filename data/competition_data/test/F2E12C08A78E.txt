the school policy should not change because the kids already work hard to get the grades that they want and changing it to a higher grade will be vary hard for them and they play sports to have fun and get away from work and changing it will make them stressed out because they have to think so much on studying and forget about the sport and they will no be able to play as well and some kids cant get there grades up because it is to hard for them and that's why they play now because the grades they have now is understandable for them to be at and it could have some good things about changing the policy but it would not be fair to the kids that play the sport because to have to think about a sports like showing up to practice remember the plays and have to be able to work with the other players and then have to deal with all the teachers and focus and there work with all the kids in the class and homework school work it is hard enough for them to get there grades higher and still play the sport that they want to play so changing it would make it hard on every one and that's why they should not change the policy
