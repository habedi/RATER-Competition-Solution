Dear Principal.

I want to debate on weather students should or should not do community services. And i think that it should be the students choice if they want to or not. For example. Many students through out the country or world feel like they need a saying or doing when it is time to make a decision on something they don't have say in it. They should choose weather to-do so or not to-do so in community services. But also there is a catch. It might depend on where you want to do it and were your doing it at. But, if the principal says all students most attend community serves hours for there school like they should, then they must follow by the principals ruling over them. This is to not be unfair but if he or she decides this it will most likely have to be approved by an adult and or the board of education for example. So in all of what i am suggesting is to students whom are in need or wanting to do so in community service it is your choice to attend this agreeable program if thou chooses to-do so in there spare time.
