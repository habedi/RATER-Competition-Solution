I think these cars could be dangerous because they drive on their own. Anything could happen with a driverless car. It could mess up a turn or anything and could crash. It sounds like a good invention but having a car you have no control over driving sounds a bit scary. I mean what would you do if you couldnt stop the car? These driverless cars they are making are controlled by a computer. What would people with driverless cars do if the computer controlling their car just crashed , or stopped working. These cars could put someone in danger all because they have no control over it.

In the text they talk about how the more smarter cars needed a lot of sensors for the startes to work. How would you feel about a car that starts itself? Think about it! Yes , it does sound nice but anything could happen to those sensors. If something were to happen to those sensors how would the car start? You'd pretty much be carless unless you took all that extra stuff out. There are alot of things that could come with having driverless car.

If I were a person who sells and advertises people to buy cars I most defintiely would not recommend them to buy a driverless car, it sounds scary and dangerous to me. The things they are coming out with now and days are crazy. It just doesn't sound like something thats safe to me. What if parents had there kids in the car and something just went wrong with the car all because they had control and it cause an accident? Their would be nothing they could do. In paragraph 7 it says " All driverless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills , if its a driverless car which should function on its own why would it need human skills. It must not be too good to drive its ownself.

I would just reconsider it on a safety level, to be on the safe side. Some things don't sound right. Can't trust everything just because it looks and sounds nice, looks can be very deceiving. Just because they say the car is good doesn't mean it is. People always make things sound so good just to get you to buy them. That's just like the saying " everything that glitters isn't gold" meaning just because it looks good doesn't mean it is. It would be crazy riding in a driverless car if you were on the highway during rush-hour. How would the car know if you needed to get over or not? How would it know where to take you? I would feel more comfortable riding in a car where i can drive for myself. Maybe I'm just used to the normal driving , anything after that sounds crazy.

In the beginning of paragraph 8 they asked the question " Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?" "Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?" I think many people would get bored sititng in a car they couldn't drive until it was needed. It just sounds pretty pointless to me. Your sitting behind a wheel and your not able to drive until it tells you to. If i had the chance I wouldn't ride in it. I wouldn't want a car telling me when I can and cannot drive.

In paragraph 7 they say how if you were in danger the car would alert the driver to be ready to drive, but if the car is so good like they say why would the car need to alert the driver to drive when its a driverless car. When I think of the word driverless I think of a no-driving car where you have to do no driving , all you do is sit back and ride. Theres something that is not to good about the car if you have to drive it why its driverless.
