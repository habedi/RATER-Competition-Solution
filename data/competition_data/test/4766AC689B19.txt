I.s.52 - 8th Grade

My Opinion is that students should be required of taking the position in the cause of community service. By helping the environment, & thinking green. Right now we are in global warming people are destroying our earth , by littering & not recycling. People are killing our ocean , that is where we get our water, animals are dying because of pollution . The principle should required all students to perform on doing community service.

Is better to take the position of community service because when they start a fresh year in high school is going to be hard to having free time. Your going to have to do more time ; right now the 8th graders are doing community service to pass the school year. I think if kids go help the school & do the community service they wouldn't have a hard time. They would just do an Hour. It's a great opportunity doing community service , because you can earn points. My opinion is that I enjoy doing community service. Kids will probably do good effort either to pass to the next grade.
