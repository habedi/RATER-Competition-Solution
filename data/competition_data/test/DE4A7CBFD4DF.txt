dear principle, i believe this should NOT be mandatory to do community service.

in fact i think schools should only work with students School time and home work. any thing beyond that is not right. students go to school to learn not to be forced to do labor "community service".

Making it mandatory for students to go out on their time and do community service will cause problems with their agenda, home work "projects, dead lines, work, etc".

lets say a student is needing to catch up on a lot of work or they wont pass. so he figures out a schedule that will get all his work done.

but then he has to do community work for no reason, this might upset him because he can not get all his work done and he will not pass putting him into a depression.

now let me give you another example, say a student is unable to work, what if he is over weight and cannot bend down to pick up trash or cant walk around in the heat, does that mean he doesn't pass?

did you know that most young kids today are over weight and cannot perform those tasks, this idea is incorrect and will enter fear with a lot of things.
