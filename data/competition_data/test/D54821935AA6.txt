One topic that is frequently debated is if summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Some people think is better if it is teacher-designed. They feel that students will follow the same path. I believe that it should be student-designed because the projects will be created differently, there may be different information in each project and students will prove their capacity to do their own project.

The projects will be created differently. Students have different ideas on how to do a project. There is variety of ideas on how to do a project. Students can choose any way on how to do it, depending on what the project is about. Some students are more creative than other students. They may have different types of creativity. By doing this project students will show if they are still learning. They will show that they are learning even if they do not go to school.

Every project may have different information. Students have different ideas on projects. The projects are always different from other students. Students do not have the same brain which means they will not have the same information. Some students like to write what comes to their mind instead of getting information by searching it. Some students will have quality of information and other will have simple words.

Students will prove their capacity to do their own project. More then showing capacity to do their own project, is more to know who is responsible,organized and where they are on a specific topic. Teachers will know on who to trust for example, I would trust more on a responsible student. Students will demonstrate to the teacher how much effort they out into a project. By doing the project students may improve and have a good grade to begin with.

In conclusion,some people will still think it is better if it is teacher-designed. They feel that students will follow the same path. I still believe that it should be student-designed because the projects will be createdÂ differently, there may be different information on each project and student will prove their capacity to do their own project.
