Many people such asÂ  me have found that what is the purpose for a car when it emits gasses or does other things that people have such as smog many for some this is why they are trying to limit there use. But it does have it advantges though. Many countries have found out that limiting car usage was a great idea to do. And that is what I am going to explain to you.

People who live in Vauban, Germany in this upscale comunities are living without a car they say that the neighborhood is "car-free" many people in stead of driving a car they either ride a bike, walk, or thay have a car but they have to buy a space in a large garage on the outside of the comunity. And they also say that is is quiet and peacful you will hear an occasional distan moter but is drowned out with people talking bikes got past or even kids in the neighborhood.

Like many other contries they have to deal with smog fron the green house gasses for cars most areas are is 50% green house gas. But like other contries they have cars banned like in europe they fine people 22 euros ($31) some even had their car impounded for there reaction. Europe mostly blames deisel fuel because most of all the cars in europe are deisel.

People who live in Bogota, Colombia they have a day where they can't use their cars it is called car-free day millions have hiked, biked, skated or take the bus to work during this day. This is the thrid year that they have done this there are over 7 million people live there and participate to reduce smog but some don't do this and the violaters are fined $25. And they haven't stopped this even when the weather is terrible such a heavy rain but people just ignore it.

That was my explanation on how people feel about limiting the use of cars wether it is car-free day in columbia fining people in europe or just have your car somewhere else like the neighborhood in Vauban, Germany people who try to limit their use of there cars ussaly follow this.
