You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program!

Here are some reasons why I believe that some people should.

It's a chance of a lifetime, not everyone gets this opportunity so you could be very lucky. You would get to help people recover their valuable items from World War II, like helping them recover their animals, food supplies, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. It is not all just work you would do also, you would get to have fun, the cowboys played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where animals have been held. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. In the end Luke is beyond greatful for his amazing opportunity, it made Luke more of people and other countries needs and not to take anything for granted because not everyone gets the opportunities we do.
