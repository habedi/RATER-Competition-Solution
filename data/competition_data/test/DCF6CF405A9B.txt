TEACHER_NAME:

In my opinion, I think that changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average instead of a grade C average is not the right decision to make. This is not the right decision to make because many students here at school have a grade C average. Playing sports at school is one way that students and children can keep fit and stay healthy. If the students have a grade C average, they may or may not be able to stay physically fit and healthy.

For many students, it is very difficult to maintain a grade B average. For example, if a student has a C in one subject that is very difficult for them, but the rest of his or her grades are A' s and B' s, the student would not be able to play the sport or participate in the school activity of their choice just because of one C.

I also believe that a grade C average is fairly good. If you do change the grade average from a B to a C, the school would not have many students participating in sports or activities. In fact, our school may not even have school activities or sports because of many students' grade C average. I think that it is best you keep the policy of maintaining a C average.

Sincerely,
