Dear Principal,

I think you should consider enforcing policy number 1. Policy number one is better for the school because if you would just let kids use their cell phones and other electronics, more students would probably pay more attention in class.

Instead of trying to text their friends in class because they cant text them at nutrition or lunch, or trying to listen to their IPODS because they can listen to it at nutrition or lunch, if you enforce policy number 1.

If us as students realize the rules your making are sort of unfair because sometimes teachers use their phone in and out of class and we don't get to use our cell phones (that's a little hypocritical), and if we think the rules are unfair were obviously not going to listen to them and make our own rules and have or make our own freedom.

So i ask as a fellow student , as an eighth grader for you to choose policy number 1, because if you choose policy number more students will pay more attention in class, learn more, get better grades, also as eighth graders you will have helped us make our last year here way better than it was going to be, and would have given us our freedom, and your trust.

That is why you should choose policy Number 1.
