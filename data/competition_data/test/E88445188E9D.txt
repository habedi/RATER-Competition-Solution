Venus is a very dangerous and unknown place, for many reasons.

Venus has consistent weather storms and natural disasters. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes alone with thunder storms. These storms make it hard to get any probes onto this planet, denying us access to Venus.

The clouds are made of acids, and the gravity is 90x stronger than it would be on earth. This makes the planet toxic, and the crushing pressure is enough to crush even our deep sea diving submarines. These conditions make it impossible to send human life, not only these things but also the heat of this planet reaches over 800 degrees farenhiet.

The atmosphere is too thick for us to take photos or videos of the planet, it wont let the light through. Because of this, we cannot study the planet as effectively as we could any other.

One of the many reasons scientists are so attracted to this planet is because they believe it was once an earth-like planet. Venus is thought to have had water, and being capable of supporting life. It shares many features with Earth and the surface of Venus also has mountains, craters, and valleys.

Venus is also one of the closest planets to earth, and is often referred to as out sister planet. Although being as far from the sun as it is, it is hotter than that of Mercury. The consistent temperature and depressing disasters on this planet are the main reason we cannot explore it, but that doesnt mean scientists have given up. As stated, they are working on a way around these obsitacles and have used a model that can survive up to 3 weeks on this planet.

The author supports the idea of exploring this planet, and believes these reasons can be overcome. We will just have to wait.
