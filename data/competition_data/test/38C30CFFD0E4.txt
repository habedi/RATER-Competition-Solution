Dear principal,

I think it would be great if you would make the students of our school participate in community service. It's time to give back. You should talk to the teachers and see what they think. I for one would completely participate in community service. I think the teachers should count the community service as a grade, extra credit, bonus points on a bad grade, or a quiz grade. Then they would be forced to do it, unless they were sick. Then they would have to make it up on more community service.

Do you think we could visit nursing homes as a community service project? I have been to one before and I loved the feeling I got when I hugged them and wished them a Merry Christmas. I know they were so happy to see some body that actually cared about them on a holiday. Others may think it's stupid, but it would make them happy and that's giving back to the community. We could also have a trash pick up day around the town or around the school and the student or group that has the most trash wins a prize and their picture in the local newspaper. I hope you think about these two community service ideas.

I love helping the environment, giving back to my community, and making the town of

Shallotte a better place to live. Also it doesn't have to be just for students and teachers any body who wants to help, families, friends, neighbors, visitors, can help us make this town a better place to live and vacation here. Please ponder with the suggestions. I know people that would love to help and I know everyone will want to help.

It's time to give back and stop being so selfish, give back to the community.

Maybe we could get some bands to perform or maybe some famous singers, get some sponsors, and have a community service day at the park where all we do is community service and raise money for places and services. Like St. Jude, or homeless shelters. We should bring gifts for each other and kids and grown up's. It will be amazing. Please think about my ideas and talk to the mayor and maybe show him my letter.
