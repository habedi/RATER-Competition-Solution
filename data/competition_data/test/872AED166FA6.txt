With a world that is so technologically advanced and expanding everyday; change and adaptation come naturally to so many aspects of life. Integrating computers and different devices into school systems has made schooling easier and more efficient, but things can always get better. Offering distance schooling would help lots of students and could change the education system for good. This would help students who have a hard time showing up to school, students with anxiety and other mental heath issues, and decrease the amount of time wasted with in classrooms. Even if not for all students, this would lead students to better futures with less problems.

There are many students who find it hard to show up to school everyday; whether that be from sickness or lack of motivation. Attendance can be very low for some and grades can suffer severely. Some mornings going to school can seem like the hardest thing to do, and many students decide to just not show up. This is where distance schooling comes in. Being able to complete work online helps reduce a large portion of the stress that school brings. This also helps students who are sick or physically injured, who can not make it to school, keep up with their work. Students who often need medical attention and miss large amounts of school can find it very hard to stay at the same pace as their peers. These students miss valuable class time where their instructor is lecturing or explaining a unit and they can't get that time back. Online schooling ensures these students are getting the education they need while still being able to miss class.

Teenage years can be very confusing for some and lots of high school students suffer from anxiety or other mental heath issues. This can make going to school very hard for some students can worsen their disease. Going to school with anxiety can be hard; being surrounded by people you are not familiar with and feeling like you are being judged by them can make it very hard to concentrate on school work. There are also many students with depression who some days can't get out of bed let alone go to school. being able to complete work online makes it so those students can chose when they get their work done and allows them to be in control which can really help their situations. Some one could argue and say separating these students from their peers could cause their disease to worsen or cause them to have poor social skills, but there are many ways to get around this. Activities like sports and clubs keep that social interaction alive and with so many technological advances making friends online is easy and done right can be safe. School also creates an atmosphere where a person can feel like they can't be themselves; online schooling takes this away; which can help a persons confidence level and cause making friends in person to be much easier. The students I have met in the past, that have been home schooled and separated by their peers, have actually been some of the most outgoing people I have come to know. These students have had no problems when faced with social interaction.

There is also a big issue with the wasted time during each school day. Little things like bell changes, class clowns, and waiting on other peers add up quickly and can waste a lot of time during the day. Having distance schooling allows students to go at their own pace. If a student needs to go over a topic again they can without taking time from other class members. It also eliminates distractions from the class and allows the teacher to focus on teaching or helping students rather than babysitting the class. There would be no need for teachers to have to stop class and wait for the attention of their class since each student will be in their own home. Each student would be able to set the pace for their education and many students would be able to finish their classes faster and possibly graduate earlier.

There are so many benefits from offering distance schooling and it could change the way we educate our youth. Schools wouldn't have to worry about attendance issues, students with metal health issues would have an easier time getting an education, and there would be no wasted time within the classroom. Online schooling for students is better for everyone overall and could cause our future generations to have better life altogether.
