Dear Principle,

Many children in our school perform community service, and many do not. I strongly believe that all students should help to make our community a better place by participating in community service. There are many different ways that someone can help; for example, there are many different kinds of community service; a different type to suit all people. Another good reason why the students of our school should do community service is because it can help the environment.

If a young adult that loves to help animals thinks that she doesn't have time for extra service hours, then she is most likely wrong. She can help her community by taking care of the abused or neglected animals. She can find some time to go out to groom the dogs, cats, and horses, or even feed them. If someone loves the ocean, fish, and exotic sea life, then he or she can volunteer at a local aquarium and clean the fish tanks or help the hurt sea turtles.

Even the extremely smart students, who think that they don't need to help, can participate in tutoring a child that can't evaluate math problems or punctuate a sentence correctly. They can even teach a deaf child to read in Braille.

Helping the environment is something we all do on a daily basis, but sometimes what we do just isn't enough. Even if all of the citizens of Connecticut recycle their plastic bottles, glass jars, tin soda cans, and the local newspaper, we will still have problems with oil spills, the fumes from our cars, and other disasters that happen everyday. However if all of the students chip in to help with cleaning up our beaches, parks, and cities, then it will be another problem solved.

Everyone enjoys something, weather it is working with our four legged friends or helping the homeless find homes, everyone can do something.

With all of the help of the almost 600 students in our school, we can save the lives of animals, feed the hungry, read to the illiterate, and guide the blind. After all of the fun we students have helping our community be a better place, other schools will most likely join in to. sooner or later, we will have a nation-wide community that helps our world become a better place for us and everyone else who lives in it.

Sincerely,
