Dear Principle:

One of the reasons families give their kids cell phones is so that they can keep in touch and always know where their child is. I thinks that you should allow students to bring their phones to school and let them use their phones at lunch or during free times.

If you had a child that went to school a long ways from where you lived, you would want to know where they are, when they are coming from school and if they need to be picked up early from school. In the first week of school, when I was a sixth grader, I was in desperate need of a phone. I accidentally left my coat in one of my classrooms and so at the end of the school day, I went to look for it. When I first got there, it took me a long time for me to find it, but when I did, I realized that my bus had already left. so, here was a sixth grader on her 4th day of school, sitting and looking for some way to call my mom to pick me up. About 5 minuets went by and there was still no ride for me. Thankfully, one of my friends gave me a ride home and my parents decided that i needed a phone. From then on, I always call my mom telling where I am after school.

You may be thinking that you can just out phones in the office for after school purposes. But, kids don't always remember important things, for example their homework. Also, the students might need their parents to bring them something during school. There have been many times when I have forgotten my homework at home or that I needed my mom to bring me something. For example, I had a big project, for my science class, that I had been working so hard on for about the past week. My project was a model of a cell and was worth a lot of points. The morning it was due, I got off my bus and realized that I left me cell model at home.

I was so nervous because if I turned it in a day late then I wouldn't the credit that I had worked so hard for. So very quickly I took out my phone and called my mom asking her to bring my project to school before my science class. She was perfectly fine with that and brought over my project. I received an A on my project and was glad that i had a cell phone to call my mom and ask her for my project.

Therefore, from personal experience, I believe that you should choose the policy that allows for students to bring their phones to school but turned off during class times and are allowed to be out during lunch or other free times. Please consider what I have Written and I hope you are happy with the choice you make on the new policy.

Sincerely,

Your Student
