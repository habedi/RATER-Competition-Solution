cars are everywhere these days, and they are commonplace among us. getting from point a to point b almost always involves using a car. but there is a different method of transportation emerging and that is public transportation. there are many benefits to public transportation including reducing emissions, having less cars on the road, and improving cities. this one far-fetched idea is now coming into the spotlight.

in cities like chicago and new york, the skies are dark and gloomy and pollution is in the air. the main contributing source come from emissions from cars. limiting the usage of cars would help to clear the skies and stop some pollution from filling the air. the quality of life would then be much better in these cities. "after days of near record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." paris needed to ban cars because the smog and pollution in the city was getting out of hand. if there were fewer cars in the city, this type of problem would never be an issue here or around the world.

traffic is always a big issue on the roads around the united states and the world. limiting car usage would ease the traffic and make roads a lot safer. when the car ban was in place in paris "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of intensifying smog." when less cars were out on the road, accidents would be greatly reduced and city highways like the ones in chicago, illinois would be much more manageable. there would be more money to work on roads since the traffic is reduced and the roads would also stay in prestine condition for longer amounts of time. events like car-free day have already had big impacts in other parts of the world and the impact would be even greater in larger countries such as the united states. "it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." having less cars on the road would benefit our society in more ways than one.

quite a few years ago, ideas such as public transportation becoming mainstream seemed pretty far-fetched. well today, those ideas can help buisnessses and whole towns limit car usage. when cars are used less frequently, the areas that have more frequent usage will be cared for even more. new sidewalks, restaurants, and shopping will emerge throughout cities and be a huge advantage. caring for roads have little benefit and putting money into public areas will help out cities tremendously. "parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up." using public transportation instaid of cars will greatly improve cities.

cars have been around for a long time and have served us for many years. now, reducing or getting rid of them seems like a viable option because emissions will be reduced, there will be less cars on the road, and cities would be improved. this task of getting rid of cars may seem hard to do but the infastructure for it is already in place. public transportation is already in larger cities such as new york and chicago and it can easily be installed in smaller towns and communities. the advantages such as less pollution and more greatly outweigh the minor inconvienences. smart planning is the best option to encompass all of these ideas. " it seperates suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called smart planning." smart planning is not only the wisest opportunities and advantages of limiting car usage for now, it is also meant to help future generations have a safer and cleaner world to live in.
