Over the summer, kids would have fun running around and hanging out with friends,but never try to grow their brains out. Some kids would have hard time increasing their vocab or some would just be lazy not doing anything at all. Doing projects would help keep the child active over the summer. In school better having the teacher pick beside the students;on the other hand,some students would prefer picking their projects in instead of the teacher. The projects should be teacher designed because it would be all prepared for you,they have a lot of ideas,and last they can help student be ready when come back from the summer break.

When teachers assign projects it would have all the things you need to know or what materials you need for the project. Teachers always have a idea what they want the student to do. Even in school,teachers would have papers ready,they would know what to say to the the students,and have assign dates when to finish the task. Other thing is they are mainly organized with their work. Being organized really help come up with ideas for projects;however, students would have hard time keeping them self organized. Students won't try to be creative with their projects,but teacher would have amazing ideas for students.

Coming with a idea for a project could be hard. Sometimes could put pressure on you to get an idea for the project,but when your teacher have a idea for you,it make things very easy for you. Other thing is depending on your teacher you could have very interesting project you could do. Most students don't even try coming up with a good project. Teachers could give you a lot of ideas that would make you active over the summer and actually could learn something new you never knew about too. Mostly with a teacher idea for a project would help influence them to actually learn something;therefore,helping them grow and be prepared for school.

Coming back from summer break could be a mess. When students come in the classroom and talk about their summer break,yet never talk about something they had learn over summer break. If teachers assign a project for each the students could help them be more prepared for school. Sometimes teachers could give you an idea how the school year going to be like or something you might learn in class. Teacher always want make you achieve you in school and they want to make you have always prepared for anything coming your way. When teachers designed the project could be a challenge too;therefore,would improve your knowledge and also help be prepared for school.

Overall having teachers come up with projects that have a better results because the project would be already be written out ,would have wonderful ideas listed for you,and helps students be more prepared for the things a head. For the students doing their projects ask for the teacher opinion on the project. Teachers just want you to learn more things about the world. Projects are here to help you improve in life and fill you with knowledge.
