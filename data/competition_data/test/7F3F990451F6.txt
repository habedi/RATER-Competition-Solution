Summer break is not a time that kids want to think about school, especially the homework factor. For kids, summer is a mental brain break, a much needed vacation, and a time where they can truly relax. A time where they don't have to worry about homework, test, or even due dates. I know for myself, I would rather not have to do a summer project. If I had the choice I would want my project to be student designed but out of better judgment I know the project would probably have to be teacher based. Letting kids determine their own guidelines would most likely result in some haphazard mess that would be near impossible to grade properly. Summer projects should be based off of a general guideline that's made by a handful of general study teachers. So the project can hit some of the basic studies that the kids would need to keep fresh in their mind for when the next school year starts.

There are some complications that could arise when making a summer project. Many kids will not have the same resources at their disposal like they would when they're in school. We can assume that some kids will not have internet access, so it's safe to say this project should either be a paper pencil project or a hands on project like community service where the kids would apply the skills they learned in class to help their communities. Though there is always the fact that some families will be on the move with vacations and large trips, so we must keep that in mind. When having projects like this one it is easy to see that there are some problems that can be posed.

There are also plenty of positives to a summer assignment, for example the kids can benefit by having to keep up their basic knowledge. That way when school comes around again it's not as hard to remember all that they learned the year before. Summer projects can also be a source for kids to develop skills, such as: problem solving, social connection, and time management. These skills would help the students advance to more adult like task that they could soon be placed before them.

There are Pros and Cons to either way the project could be based and i've concluded that the teacher based project would be more beneficial for the student. Many kids will not be happy about a summer project. Hopefully they will understand the benefits they could achieve when they truly try to reach the projects full potential.
