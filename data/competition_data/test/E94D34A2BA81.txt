Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people that were effected by world war 2. They got their seamanÂ’s papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, wich means he could be drafted for millitary service. When he was discharged in 1947 he has made nine trips the most trips a seagoing cowboy has had.

It took the seagoing cowboys two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke was busy caring for the animals during the crossings. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned and Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship

There was alot to do over seas Luke helped alot of people over seas. he crossed the pacific ocean 2 times.
