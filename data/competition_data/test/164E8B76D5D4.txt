Dear Principle:

I believe that students should be able to bring their cell phones to school because of many different reasons. Such as if their parent needs to tell them something and the school line is busy, what would they do then. What if a Child Molester were to steal a kid off the playground they would have their phone to call for help, or text for help.

Now, I know these things are a little far fetched but would you risk a student like that. One of the students relatives could have died or is in the hospital and the student needs to go to a friends house after school because the parents are at the hospital that is in another town. Texting the student would be much easier that calling the school and keeping the kid from class for 10-20 minutes wouldn't it.

Now, this whole Child Molester thing most likely will not happen but i mean just in case right. It would be better if the student had there phone on them just in case something happened. Another case would be students running off to were a teacher could not see them. Jr. High, High School, Elementary it doesn't matter kids are rebellious by nature. These kids that ran off, one of them gets hurts no time to run to a teacher and run all the way back. So, what do you do you pull out your cell phone and call the school or a friend that you know will answer. Then a teacher comes and helps you and you get in trouble for not being where you were supposed to be doing. But everybody is ok, why because you let them bring their phone to school.

These things most likely will not happen but you have to think outside the box because anything can happen in this crazy mixed up world.

Sincerely ,
