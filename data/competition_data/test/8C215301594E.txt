I believe that summer projects should be designed by teacher's. Summer projects are meant to keep students minds engaged so that when school starts back up again in the fall, they are ready to hit the ground running. Studies show that 76% of students who have summer projects get 22% higher test scores in the first quarter. Parents who have shared their input with schools about summer projects also say that their children seem more engaged for the entire summer. Parents who have children that don't receive summer assignments have said that their children lay around and do nothing all summer. Teachers should design summer projects because they know what is going to be taught in the upcoming year, and they know how challenging to make summer assignments in order to keep students engaged all summer long.

Teacher's start making their lesson plans before their school year even starts in order to be prepared for he upcoming year. If teacher's are preparing for school to start up again in the summer then why shouldn't students be preparing for school during the summer? When students don't come prepared on the first day if school, it sets off a bad tone for the rest of the school year. When students aren't prepared to start learning then they start off behind everyone else who did come prepared. Summer assignments keep students minds in shape over the summer so that they are prepared to start learning on the first day of school. Teachers should make these summer assignments because they know what is going to be taught in the upcoming year, therefore they know what the students should be working on over the summer in order to give them a head start for the whole school year.

A lot of teacher's have started teaching right when school starts, especially in high school. Because of this, students who don't show up prepared to learn right away start the entire year off on the wrong foot and sometimes it's hard to ever get back on track. So to combat this, teachers assign summer projects that are challenging enough so that students still have to work to complete the assignment but not so difficult that it's impossible. Teachers should design the summer assignments because they know how challenging to make the summer assignments. Students who aren't challenged at least a little over the summer also come to school unprepared to hit the ground running. So in order for students to be properly prepared to start learning on the first day of school, teachers should design the summer project.

Some people may disagree and say that students should be able to design their own lesson plan because hey know how difficult their assignments should be. If students were to make their own summer assignments they wouldn't be prepared o start learning right away. A lot of students would make their assignment so easy that they could finish it in 10 minutes while others would make it so difficult that it would be impossible to finish. Teachers would know how hard to make a summer assignment based on how the student performed in the previous year and what they need to be prepared for in the upcoming year.

Teachers should be the people to design summer projects for students because they know what the students will be learning in the upcoming year and they know what the students have already learned. Summer assignments are meant to keeps students minds in shape s that they are ready to start learning on the first day of school. When students make their own summer assignments, they tend to be ill-prepared to start learning immediately. Teachers know what's best for their students so teachers should make the summer assignments.
