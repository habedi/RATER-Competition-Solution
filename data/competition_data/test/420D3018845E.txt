I agree with the principal's decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it is an excellent way to find interests in leisure time, improve people's social and health lives, and it has an important role in serving the community and academic success.

First of all, many students, especially teenagers, spend a vast amount of time on social medias and cellular devices. It may lead to negative consequences such as lack of self-control and self-management, imperfect grades, and even cyberbullying. Before students become mature enough to handle their own situations, adults should be the supervisors and help them get on the right track. Sometimes it is acceptable to force people to on a certain task for their own benefits. Therefore, extracurricular activities is a great option when it comes to after school life. Students may seek their true interests through these experiences and even more, find the purpose of their lives. For instance, a student who participates in a the student council may find a big interest in politics or management; another student who works on the yearbook might seek a great favor in arts and photography. Moreover, there is a possibility that some people can target what they want to major in for the future.

Additionally, extracurricular activities may contribute to students' health and social lives by creating opportunities such as teamwork and group projects. Besides focusing on school grades, students should also pay attention on developing relationships and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, all of these are going to be helpful for having great experiences in the society. Many students crave for a sense of belonging and they often find unexpected gains in extracurricular activities such as friendship or a healthy life style. For example, playing sports can exercise your body and strengthen your muscles, when people get older, it can even prevent typical diseases for a longer life span. Also, sport teams often develop communication and teamwork skills, through these activities, students are able to make new friends by talking about topics that they are interested in, and these relationships can also be a source of strength when people come into challenges and difficulties in life. It is a positive way for students to be physically and mentally prepared for the future.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities is a nice way to contribute to the school and it can even be beneficial to academic success. School provides an educational environment for students and students can participate in activities such as school board or the announcements and news program to serve back to the school. In a way, it has the same meaning and purpose as community service, it advocates for serving others and offers many experience that are helpful to the society. On the other hand, participating in extracurricular activities may serve as a great advantage in high schoolÂ or college applications, every school looks forward to accepting students who are willing to spend effort on things that they are interested in, and at the same time know the importance of serving back to the community.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities have many benefits for students' academic and after school lives such as finding one's personal interests, adding more values to one's social and health life, and lastly, serving the community while being grateful for nice things in the world. With all these advantages, I think it would be a beneficial decision to suggest students to engage in extracurricular activities.
