Dear Principle,

Some kids don't do anything around the house. There are also kids who don't help out the community; they would rather stay at home and just hang out with friends. That is why

I believe that you should require all of the students at our school to do community service. There are so many kids that just sit inside all day and play video games and watch television. They can be a big help to the community if they help out in any way. After you perform community service, you always feel like you have done something good for the community. That feeling is incredible, and makes you want to keep doing good things.

There are many ways that kids can do community service. Kids of our age don't do community service on their own because they think it's boring and a waste of time. Those kids think that community service is just picking up trash on the highway, or having to donate money to a charity. There are many ways that kids can do community service, ranging from going to work with a parent or helping out at the school. I even know some friends that go to work at the soup kitchen so homeless people can have food. They say that it's very fun because they are all together. They also like to see the look on homeless peoples faces. They are always grateful and happy when they get their food.

Certain kids do not want to do community service because it conflicts with their schedules. It also a waste of time to them. People don't know that community service can be done, but enjoyed at the same time. I was in a Leadership class where I had to do ten hours of community service. At first I was frustrated and kind of dubious of what I should do. I later found out that I can work at places that I love to be. I went to help out my cousin over the weekend at the basketball court because he asked me to help his team. I went and I enjoyed it because I love basketball and have a great knowledge of it.

Because kids think it is boring and a waste of time, they don't do community service. The kids that never do community service will regret it for the rest of their lives. My dad's work is the top donating business in San Bruno. They are also donate the most time doing community service. Because of that, they have built trust with many people around the United States, and his business is very successful. Community service comes from the heart. It takes a real human being to skip an hour of time being with his friends to do some community service.
