It not a good benefit that school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. It not a good idea because you dont learn the same like in school.

This program is easy way to get the credit you need for graduation. the other think is you dont know about the students in this program, if they are learning or if they are cheating. This program it not a great idea, they need to take away this program and make sure student come to school to learn more then being in home.

This program it not a great idea because you dont learn the same like in school. Everything what you learn in school is more better, more helpful. In school the classes is the all day, but that is only for one hour or two. Is not the same skills learning pain attention.

This program is an easy way to get the credit you need for graduation. Because you dont need to do the same work like in school. The work what the teacher is going to give you is easy. In school you need to work hard until you past your classes.

The other think is you dont know about the students in this program, if they are learning or if they are cheating. In this program is easy to cheat, because teachers on the other side of the computer they dont know what the student is doing in the moment. For that there are student that they dont learn anything with school home. Sometime there are teachers that, they show you a lot of stuff.

Does are the reason why school home dont benefit for student. I prefer to go to school where i am going to learn more. This program is not a good idea for students, and that why they need to remove it. If teachers want to a student to learn they need to go to school.
