Dear Principal,

I think that students should take part in community service. It teaches them many lessons about helping and giving back to the community. When students do thing outside of school it gives them a chance to choose and be creative. Many students do not have a sense of creativity. Many students when given the opportunity to be creative often turn it down. Doing community service outside of school gives them that opportunity. Also it gives a student the chance to give back, and sometimes meet new people. I think that people don't often see the upside to doing community service. Your really helping people that need it, you may not be as happy that your doing this but just the opposite the people that you have helped really appreciate what you do. One year i wrote letters to senior citizens and followed up on this letter by going out and racking leaves for the people we sent letters to. When i knocked on the door just the look on the peoples faces when we said we were going to rake their leaves. One women i remember she sent me and my group of friends a letter addressing all of us to give us a great thank you. Community service helps not only the people your giving the service to it also could make your friend want to get involved in community service. This is why kids should do community service it is a very good idea to continue this act and pass it down for each grade.

Your Student,
