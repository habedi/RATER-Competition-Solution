Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am an average eight grade student. I have recently learned that you are considering changing the school policy so that only kids with an average above a B grade can only participate in spots. I understand why you might think of changing the school policy but to me it just seems unfair.

I understand that many kids in my grade have below a B average and I know that they try their hardest but many kids are very talented in sports although their grades are not above a B average. Many of the school sports teams need these kids to help them win their games. Also when these kids apply for other schools they will need the extra curricular credit to get into these schools.

For example when applying for collages may kids talented in sports get collage scholarships even though their grades are not the model grades they are still passing.

I think that instead of a B average you should lower your policy to a C average because many kids in the grade get a C average. Also it would make it easier for the kids to get into sport teams. This way the kids are not failing and are still being able to chase their dreams. Many kids are also looking forward to trying out for the school teams.

For example my best friend Sabrina is the best pitcher in softball and she is looking forward for trying out for the softball team this spring but she only has a C average. I am also looking forward to trying out for the softball team this spring and if you change the school policy we will lose our best pitcher and our team will suffer a great loss. I ho

Many students in the grade are very disappointed among hearing that they need a grade B average to participate in the school sports teams and other extra curricular activities. I understand that you are trying to get the students in the grade to do better but if they don't have anything to look forward to at the end of the school day they may be sad and start slacking. But I think that you should keep a policy for a grade C average may of the students will try hard to maintain that grade. Thank you for you time and I hope you take my proposal into consideration.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
