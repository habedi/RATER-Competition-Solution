I feel as though driverless cars are needed and could prove very useful to society. There are many concerns as to whether or not driverless cars are necessary or not. This essay is going to tell you how they can be safer than human drivers and can help solve some problems our world faces today.

Many people are concerned with the gas consumption of cars today. They fear that since so many people drive their own cars, they have to use up more gas, which is very hard to get more of. Driverless cars could be used in a taxi service sort of way, meaning more people could use one car since there wouldn't have to be a specific seating arrangement. If more people use one car, that's less gas consumed and more gas for the future.

People are also concerned with the overall safety of driverless cars. Some main pressing concerns are crashes and whether the car would be able to know how to avoid construction zones. While these are very important concerns, the creators of driverless cars are working to make sure those problems aren't a worry. As of right now, driverless cars aren't entirely driverless. They still require a driver to avoid construction zones. However, with the way technology is advancing, it won't be long until they find out ways to help the cars avoid danger themselves without the help of drivers.

There are concerns regarding the safety and other features of driverless cars. However, these concerns can be easily solved with the advancement of technology. With technology evolving faster than we can believe, safe driverless cars won't just be a thought, they'll be a great impact on human society in the near future. Therefore, driverless cars should definitely be developed and everybody should be completely behind the development of them.
