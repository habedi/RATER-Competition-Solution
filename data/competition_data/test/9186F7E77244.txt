The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not taht valuable bacause you can tell how a person might be feeling by looking at their face expression. People show their feelings by showing their facial expression towards others, but some people just wont show how they feel with facial expressions, they might express their emotions through words.

Emotional expressions are not always a true version of a person's feelings. People some times pretend to express something else then how they really are feeling inside. Everyone has gone through the same problem of having to fake a smile and pretend to be happy, but in the inside you might just feel awful. Also, there's no reason why a computer should tell us how we're emotionally feeling, the paragraph shows how a student gives his or her parthner directions on how to move the muscles to smile, which it shows that by looking at the muscles on someone's facial expression we can aslo tell their emotional expressions.

Knowing how someone feel can aslo make you figure out a way on how you could help out and make them feel better if they're not feeling well. A computer can't help out someone feel better, but us as humans can. Technology is not valuble for students in a classroom, it can help read your emotional expressions, but it can't help you feel in a better way.
