Many students have time on their hands but most don't. I think that participating in extracurricular activities should be optional and not forced. Some students may need it but most are busy or already occupied. I think that if you are a student you shouldn't have to be forced to do extracurricular activities you should want to yourself, example if I wanted to do sports I should but if my dad or mom is forcing me then I dont want to. Extracurricular activities are optional for a reason they wouldn't be a part of our schools if we didn't choose for them to be. The reason I disagree with the principals idea is because most students don't have time, also a lot of students are usually helping their parents or doing schoolwork, or they just dont have reason to participate or don't want to participate in them.

I think that students should do extracurricular on their own time and not because someone is making them do it when there in the middle of something like a family death or a very important meeting with the boy scouts or maybe even another extracurricular activity that isn't a part of their school system. I think that if student have time they should consider it but they don't have to do it if they're not encouraged or they don't have the time to do it if they're busy I don't want them to have to do something that interrupts them. another reason is what if they're out doing something every night like supporting their family to help pay the bills, or out doing groceries because their parents can't, or maybe picking little Johnny from the bus stop. You can't just go do something because someone tells you to you should do it because u can or want to.

Another thing is most students go to school what would happen if I went to play soccer instead of doing home work or classwork that needs to be finished .many people in the United States are hard working even children do u think we can do extracurricular activities. If we need to do chores or work we can't do extracurricular activities if were doing school work. what would happened if we missed studying for the SOL because I was drafted to do soccer and I failed it, we would fail a grade because doing a mandatory extracurricular activity and to me that seems stupid.

What if we don't want to do extracurricular activities because they're not fun or interesting, what is the point of doing extracurricular activities if we don't like them. Also we could be going outside and exploring but if extra curricular activities are mandatory we couldn't have the fun we have every day we would lose interest in our lives. If we wanted to do activities then we could but they're called extra curricular for a reason not curricular activities we already have enough of those in school so why should we do them out of school.

In my opinion I don't want to be forced to do something that i don't want to do you can but I wont stand for it if I don't have to so please don't make me. We may not have the time to do it or may have something to do maybe we even don't want to do it because we have something better to do its just not right to make someone do something if they don't need to or more importantly don't want to. Also why force us to do them if you have six hour to do them in school, make us do it on your time not ours.
