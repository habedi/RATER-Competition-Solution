Summer is a long vacation where students take break from all school works and have time for themselves and it should be student-designed. This can even allow teacher not to have so much work to grade and they themselves can go on vacations also. Students shouldn't be required to complete summer projects, because it's a time for students to spend time with their families, have experience in job or volunteer for clubs, and have time for themselves.

During summer breaks student get to spend with parents go on vacations, visit families in other countries and take care of their siblings. They get to have fun with their families for example, go in a 5k run, go to the museum, which can let them get closer to their famllies.

Students get to have job experience or volunteer for other clubs. They can even have interest in something which is a great opportunity for them to know their future career and it's very important for every student. They also get to know work ethics before they get in there future career. For example they can babysit which can give them the experience about babies if they like them or not. They also get the opportunity to get a job and save up for college, which can help them become responsible.

Summer it's a time for students to have time for themselves. Students do not really get time for them and it's becoming a difficult thing for them, because to all the school works and school stress. They get to have their own time, like hanging out with their friends, going cool and relaxing places or going for therapy. There is a poem that state that, " all work and no play, makes a person doll. No work and no play makes a person lazy." There is times to work and there is time to take breaks. Students can't be working all the times, they have to get time for themselves especially their social life.

Even though student summer breaks are for student to relax and get experiences for other job, however, it some student play all the time, have fun and not even read a book or revise the lesson he or she was thought before the summer break. This can can cause a student to forget everything they've learn. It can also cause students to be lazy and not wanting to go back to school any more. For example a student can play a game called play station by the time summer is over the student can get addicted to it and he or she will focus on the game more than his or her studies.

To sum up, summer projects should be student-design and let them explore around the world or wherever they want to go and relax their brains. Teacher should also time about it." All work and no play makes a person doll, no work and no play makes a person lazy."
