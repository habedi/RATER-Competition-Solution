The last minute strike on the last day of school, students are eager to leave school right away and start their vacation. As time progresses, They tend to lose valuable information they learned from the previous school year. In order to prevent this, some schools assign summer projects to assure that students will continue to learn during the break with a teacher designed or student designed. in which case that, these summer projects should be student designed because it'll improve their knowledge, decrease their laziness, and it'll give them the opportunity to learn new things.

Although, some schools prefers teacher designed projects instead of student designed This makes sense because most students relies on the teacher to provide them the information they need in order to complete the project and it'll be easier for them to understand. However, It causes confusion to students that dont understand or is struggling to what the question is asking and which later builds up stress. Therefore, These summer projects should be student designed.

Starting with improving their knowledge, students have a hard time understanding of previous and new materials in the new school year. If the summer project were a student designed, students can go improve their knowledge by understanding on the topic they worry to forget. In this research, Generic_Name is an 11th grader that is concern of forgetting the basic of literature and annotations. On her project, she provided of how reading through databases and books that helped her understand more about literature. With the annotation she wrote down helpful websites with tips that can improve annotating. This proves that with the student designed project, It helps you go on your own pace and understand the material more. Another research is Generic_Name from 9th grade, He has been struggling with US history and key events of WWII. With his project, he remembered the important dates and researched more information about those events that happened. This shows that with jogging down materials from previous events and providing more gathered materials helps them improved their knowledge of the lesson.

In addition, It can decrease their laziness. Over the summer, students are usually unmotivated to do anything or on widgets to kill time. If the summer project was student designed, student can spend their time outside and be motivated to find their research. In evidence, a high school student was planning to research about the Cherokee online and not going to a museum about Native Americans, Instead she went out to D.C and gathered information about Cherokee, researched events and tour about the Cherokee lifestyle. This shows that with the student designed project, they can explore outside and be productive. In another evidence, an elementary school student was to research about evolution of butterflies. They gathered materials to find where they live and with very detailed how the process from a caterpillar turned to a butterfly. This shows that with going out to research a butterfly instead of reading a children's book about butterfly evolution can decrease the laziness through the summer break.

Finally, It'll give them opportunities to learn new things. Most students know basics notes they knew back and to which, doesn't expand on their learning. With the student-designed project, they can explore any new subject to work on and research. For example, a 5th grader was assigned a summer project about anything and they wanted to research on prehistoric animals such as dinosaurs,they can receive and gain new facts and notes about their habitat,types of species,etc. This proves that students will improve on learning with new gathered materials they received. In another example, Generic_Name was a 7th grader who knew nothing about Gettysburg Address. Gathering all the historic website she was provided from her history teacher, she read very intellectual quotes and statements from President Lincoln that provided her new information about Abraham Lincoln and Gettysburg Address. This shows that with no knowledge about the topic, you can still find new resources and opportunities to find the topic

On to the end, every student loses at least the most valuable lessons they learned in their previous school year. If students were to have the own designed project over the summer, they can go beyond with improving their knowledge, be more motivated to decrease their laziness and lastly have a bit freedom to search more opportunities to learn new things.
