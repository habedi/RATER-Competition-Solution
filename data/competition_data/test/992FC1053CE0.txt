I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because it causes many car crashes every year, it can make your car insurance go up even higher, and if you have a passenger in the car you should also think about their lives as well. People are more worried about who they're texting or who they're on the phone with. Driving while on the phone shouldn't be taken lightly because you are endangering your life and others around you. In this essay I will give you reasons why texting on the phone should be banned.

The first reason is that you can easily cause an accident while you're on the road. If you use a phone while driving it's basically like you're driving while drunk because you're not focused on the road as much as you think. "Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving". If you are texting while driving you're going to be more focused about sending that text to your friends or family than driving. "One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving". That is the first reason why you shouldn't text and drive.

Another reason while texting while driving should be banned is because it can cause your insurance to go up. If you get in a car accident because you were texting instead of focusing on the road is bad because your insurance company will find out and they will raise your car insurance because of that. "The more tickets you attract to your name because of driving while on the phone the more your insurance bill goes up". If you cause an accident because you were on your phone then the bill to get there car fixed has to be paid by your insurance company. "It states that the person that is at fault for a car accident caused by cell phone use their insurance company has to pay for the damage". That is my second reason to why cell phones should be banned while driving.

My last reason why cell phones should be banned is because they could hurt or even kill passengers or pedestrians. Transporting other people in your vehicle is a big responsibility especially if you tend to use your phone will driving. "Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, even though some young drivers fail to notice". If you use your phone to send a text while driving with passengers in the car you are putting their lives in danger as well as other pedestrians. Most people probably couldn't live with the guilt knowing they caused someone to suffer a life altering injury or even death. "Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle".

That is the last reason why I chose to ban cell phone use while driving.

Laws banning texting and driving should be mandatory in each state. Many people do not realize that texting while driving can be just as dangerous as driving drunk. People should always be focused on the road then texting someone while driving especially if you just started driving. Those are my three reasons why cell phone use should be banned while driving.
