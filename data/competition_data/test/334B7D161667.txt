Dear, Mr. Principal

I support the policy number 2 because if you let all the students have there phones out during free time some or everybody will still have them out during classes and not turn off. Even if everybody said to turn them off they will some how or another still be texting some one else during classes and not do there work like they should be or they could be texting each other the answers during a test or any other school/class work. there could also be threats going around by bully's. In addition it could be stoled by another student there at school, or the could be to many people getting in trouble for something they didn't do for letting someone else use there own phone, or even someone braking some else phone there could just be to much trouble with phone in schools gourde. Mr. Principal i support policy number 2; do not allow any students to have phones at school at all.

sincerely, your student
