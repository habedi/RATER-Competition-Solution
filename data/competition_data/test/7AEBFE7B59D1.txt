Students around the country are forced to work on a summer project after school finishes. Most schools in the country assign summer projects so the students don't forget what they learned in the school year. But recently students are asking if they can design on how they do their summer project because they think it would be better for them. Although some may believe otherwise, Teachers know what the student needs to know for next year, Teachers have access to materials that students need, and Teachers can grade the summer project fairly prove that summer projects should be teacher-designed.

Teachers know what students need to know for next year. When a teacher assigns a summer project to a student it's so that the student is prepared for next year. If a student designed their own summer project they will not be prepared for next year. However, some students say that they will be more prepared if they design their summer project. But while making their summer project they could get stuck and their won't be any help on how to fix the problem.

Teachers have access to materials that students need. If a teacher gives a student a packet full of questions for their summer project. It's most likely a combination of questions from a teacher workbook. But some students will say that they can find their own workbook to use. However, teacher workbooks have more in-depth concepts while a regular workbook has the basic ideas.

Teachers can grade the summer project fairly if they assign it. Teachers that give out summer projects have a checklist of what the project should have on it. But if a student turns in a student-designed project. The teacher wouldn't know how to grade it because all the other student-designed projects will be different. But some students might say that they could follow a rough checklist. However, a rough checklist could miss a few details that could be important in what they are learning.

Teachers knows what information the student would need for next year. Also teachers have access to workbooks that students don't have access to. Finally teachers can grade the summer project fairly as well are reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed.
