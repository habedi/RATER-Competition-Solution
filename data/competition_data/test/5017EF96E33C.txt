Some schools require summer project to assure that they students are continuing their learning habits. If so I think the project should be student-designed. Whenever there's a project it's always teacher-designed. If the student is designing the project the teacher get to see how very creative they are. This will help Student not to compare each other. By doing that the student have more confidence in them self.

My first statement on this Student designed project is the comparing that every single student does I mean every student does this to them self. It's different when student are checking to see if they done everything for the project with another student. In the world we live in today is all about what this person have and what I don't have. Students will compare each other no matter if they have A's or C's they will compare each others. Comparing breaks down the confidence in their-self and by them doing that it destroy their reason to do better for them-selves.

My second statement is the it helps the students to express them-selves in many different ways that truly makes student more happy to do and finish the project. I have a project in Spanish class that is about us. Some of my classmates are writing, typing, poster board, and a PowerPoint on the project. It made my class happy to do it by letting them show some creative. I know that a teacher loves for students to show off their creative.

My third statement students will learn to respect others opinion on the topic they choose. In the world today our country is divide by people who believe in this and people who don't believe in that. Our country is falling apart because of no respect for other opinions. The world thinks everyone should have one mind set and it's destroying this beautiful place we call America. This will be teaching student to respect others opinions even if you don't agree on it.

As i'm coming to end I believe that summer projects should be student-designed base. It's helping us to learn, grow, and open your eyes to more than our opinions. So teachers make the summer projects student-designed. I know the students will love expressing them-selves in many different ways. By doing this it's helping our country grow strong together.
