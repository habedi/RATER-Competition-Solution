Dear principle,

I know that there will be a possible policy change that to play a sport you have to have a grade B average, but if students have a grade C average how are they suppose to participate in school activities and have fun in school sports. Also don't you think some kids would get angry at this. One student might have a 73% average and could be very good at a sport and not be able to play. Although this policy can be bad it can be good at the same time. If one kid has a grade of 71%, this policy could probably push him/her to being a better student and to play the sport that he/she would like to. I would let the kids play the sports though. I would make the policy to have a 70% average so that you would need at least 5 points more than a passing grade. Also if a student would be good at activity such as arts and crafts, then that student would want to be in the activity with a 71% gade. So i would not go with this policy.
