Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should require kids to partake in community service. It could help troubled kids out and take away the pressures in life. It could teach kids the meaning of helping others and to not be selfish. Community service can also help those who are in need of food or need a tutor to pass whichever grade they are in.

Community service could help the people who are involved in gangs to stop and help others. This one kid in the ninth grade was in a gang, but stopped because he started community service. If a gang member was trying to find something else to do besides be involved in gang affairs, he could do community service to stop his violent needs.

Community service would help those who need to learn to not be selfish. If someone was self centered and didn't care about anyone but himself/herself, they could perform community service to learn the value of helping others. If everyone would perform community service then not a lot of people would be self centered. A kid named OTHER_NAME was self centered until he got involved in community service.

If people in our school participated in community service, then the graduation rate of Texas graduation rate would go up. Also the number of homeless people could go down. The students that participate help tutor kids and help build houses. It might be a big responsibility, but I am positive we can manage to help people out. A fifth grader named OTHER_NAME

wouldn't have passed the fourth grade if it wasn't foe his tutor, who was performing community service.

As I have stated, community service has only positive effects no negative ones. If you would require the students of SCHOOL_NAME to partake in community service than more people would graduate, there won't be a lot of young gang members and there won't be a lot of selfish people. Please consider requiring students to participate in community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
