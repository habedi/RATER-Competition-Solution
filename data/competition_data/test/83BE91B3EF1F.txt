Some schools are now offering students the option to take their classes from home, by going online or video conferencing, this has brought up a lot of questions and people are unsure if this is a good idea or not. Students should not be allowed to take their classes from home, because it gives them an unfair advantage over kids that choose to take their classes at school and it rewards kids for being Lazy.

If students take classes at home they will have unlimited access to internet. Almost everyone nowadays has a smart phone, tablet, computer, etc. so it would be quite easy for these stay at home students to simply Google the answer to questions and get a grade that they didn't truly earn. Students that choose to come in to school, are constantly watched by teachers and aren't given this freedom. This problem could also lead to students getting into colleges they don't truly deserve to go to and possibly take a spot from someone who actually worked hard to get their. Something that coud possibly fix this problem, is having students signing some for of honor code, promising they understand the freedom and that they won't cheat or take advantage of it, but there is no way to make sure the students keep their word.

Most of the students that would choose to do this, would probably be students that are just too lazy to get dressed and come to school. Every Student that goes to the public school that they are zoned for, are either offered a bus or are within walking distance to the school. As stated in the last paragraph, the students that stay home get an unfair advantage and they are given this just because they just don't feel like going to school. However, there should be the option for students to stay home if it qualifies as a need. If students are sick, injured, or have something else that is truly not allowing them to function fully in the classroom setting, they should be aloud to do their work from home. These students that qualify to stay home, should receive a certain amount of time until they are expected back at school, so that they don't try to take advantage of this accommodation.

Students should not be allowed to take their classes from home, because it gives them an unfair advantage over the other students and it rewards them for being lazy. All students should be given the equal chance to suceed and since some students don't work well at home or without guidance from a teacher, they will be forced to work from behind these lazier students.
