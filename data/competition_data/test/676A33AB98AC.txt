Limiting car usage could make americans daily life alot better. Americans have always relied on a automobile for there means of transpertatio n but if we limited our automobile use our lfe's would get alot better. Other countries are doing it and there getting positive outcomes. So should we follow other countires in there no car days or car ban?

In Vauban, Germany the community is completely car free. its a experimental district that does not allow the ownership of a car, 70 percent of familes in Vaubans do not own cars 57 percent sold a care to move to Vauban. Heidrum Walter said "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"by elimanting the use of cars this community is less stressful of traffic and has reduced emmisions.

If us as Americans used bikes or walked or took the buses to our destination, pollution and smog would decrease. In Paris a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of the global city. Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. After 2 days of the car ban the sog cleared up. Imagine if we did that here in the united states polution would go down drasticaly.

And if we stoped driving cars for a few days every week there would be lesser car accidents every year. people would have to walk to there destination or ride a bike and people would get exercise from the walking or riding the bike. We would spend less money on gasoline or desiel.

Americans car use is already have starting to decrease since 2005, If the pattern persists it will have benefial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. So many good thigs come from using cars less and if we start following the trend our lifes and communities will soon improve.
