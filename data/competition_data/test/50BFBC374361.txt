To the principal:

Why should we be allowed to have cell phones at school? Well the first reason is football players, baseball players, cheerleader, and other after school activates have to have them for when practice is over, but i agree that we should just use them at lunch or when we have free time. We should just leave them in our back packs till after school when we need them. some people use them in class I'm not saying i don't use it in class i text all the time, But that's the teachers fault they should be up at the chalkboard teaching. Instead they sit around texting there wife's and husbands. but i think they should be two teachers in class ,one in the back ,and one up at the board. So the one in the back can look up and down the rows. But if you keep letting the teacher text in class then u should just forget about the MCT cause we never talk about school work we just sit in class like dummy's . but if u let us students bring cell phones and let us text during our free time and lunch then maybe students would get tired of texting and start doing the work. The only reason we do it cause it is illegal
