To the Principal

Excuse me but what i would like to say is that it would not be right if you change the requirements. Say that you would change the requirements what do you think would happen well let me tell you briefly. What would happen is that mainly everyone maybe even the most smartest people in the school have had a "C" average. So changing the requirements would pretty much get rid of almost every person in the sports teams. If you were to change the average requirements then you would pretty much be getting rid of every team including, The chess teams, Math teams , and every other scholastic team there is in the school by changing the requirements i would think that you are just giving up on your school. i have to say not everyone can maintain at least a "B" average it is very hard and just look at your students records that will tell you everything that i was just explaining. Mostly all of the students here get a "C" once and every while what you have to do is just be patient with everyone and at least try to consider the possibility of making the average to "C" if this happens you wont be sorry.

Having this brief argument i hope that you have learned that you are not just getting rid of your teams you are getting rid of your students and that is the complete truth from all of the students. but also it would also be an issue with the parents because some of them pay so much money just to see that their kid is not going to be in the activity because of just a little bad grade i hope that you see that and that sometime you may change it in the early present while you still have some chance of gaining your students trust and respect again. Some day your students will thank you for putting the average back down and you would have made some people really happy.

From a student who cares.
