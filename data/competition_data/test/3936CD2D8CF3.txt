In this essay in the article " Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System I was talking about how are the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

First on that time some computers are creating to recognice emotions, in the text say, " Mono Lisa at least acccording to some new computer software that can recognize emotions." She was according that she wanted to find ways to humans express they emotions, but later the Dr. Huang was developed a betters ways to humans can be communicate with others. In the text say, " Dr. Huag and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humas and computers to communicate" this mean that the Dr. Huag he is trying to find how calculate the feelings of humans and he is a expert at developing a computers that way people will be have how they communicate with others to the place and another pleace.

In addition this process begins with a cumputer 3-D this was called an " action unit" this is how they is trying to find how are the humans emotions. The Dr. Paul Eckman was a creator the FACS ( Facial Action Coding System) he creater this, then he classified whats are the emotions that he is trying to has. In the text say, Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic of the facial muscle." This mean how the Dr. Paul uses this six category to see how the students express their emotions. I think that this is help us because they know when the students are sad, fear, happy , anger or samething like the Dr. Paul saids. These emotions is classified to find the emotions of people.

Now the new emotion they use in people and then they compare with the real face , in the article say, " Using video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa," and " Each expression is compared against a neutral face" they use videos imagery to show the emotions when they use the creation that they creater to see how are the ractions, and then they compared against the neutral face with the face that they have.

Also there is a lot ways that they have to use in emtions but not all the ways are express the same ways. Some ways that they use are bad beacuse some humans don't wanted that people know their life and another humans wanted that they help them to find their emotions because they don't know how they feel or how are their emotions.

When they uses with students is so confused for them. Students is becoming confused how Dr. Huag predicts, in the article say, " A classroom computer could recognized when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Haug predicts. " Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." The same make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. " Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," this mean that for some students are boring but fr the others students are good and they used one and other ways to recognize the emotions and finally they found and they know when the students used a lot the computers to compared animated face or something like that.

In conclusion I learn that they are different ways to humans express their emotions that is hard for the Drs. to find the emotions for recognize how humans feeling. Also this ways a lot of students use to compared their emotions with someone else.
