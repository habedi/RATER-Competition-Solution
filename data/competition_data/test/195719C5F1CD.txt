Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I support policy two because if they have cell phones during free periods and lunch it could cause physical and emotional harm to others because they might run into each other while walking around or be spreading rumors about other people, And it would not be fair to the people who don't have phones or not allowed to bring there phones, and if they were allowed to have phones during those times they might have just took a test and be telling the other people the answers to it, or they might start a conversation that they didn't get to finish in that time and still use it in the middle of class. it might also effect there behavior in the next class they go to or it could effect there grades, they could also lose track of time or not hear when they are supposed to come back inside school to start class again, they would also use them in the halls that could cause a fight or someone dropping their phone or someone running into another person causing injuries or arguments.
