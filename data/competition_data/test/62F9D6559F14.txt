Dear Principle,

I believe that Policy 1 is the better choice for cell phone use in school.

I say this because of a few reasons.

One reason i say this is because if a kid feels sick he can get permission and call his/her parents from their cell phone in between classes or at lunch.

Another reason is that if there is an early release from school or any other reasons the student should be allowed to call home if they don't have busing any more. If they were in this situation and couldn't use there phone they would be stranded at school until their mom, dad, or relative could pick them up.

Another reason i prefer Policy 1 is because if you ask any kid if they would like to have there phones during school 100% of them would say yes.

Kids prefer to have cell phones in school, and if you chose Policy 2 students and parents would not be happy

I disagree with Policy 2 because parents absolutely have to know if something happened at school for example, during an early release the students would be stranded in school.

Please consider my opinion as a student.

Sincerely,

Student
