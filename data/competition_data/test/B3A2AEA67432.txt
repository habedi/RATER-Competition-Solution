I don't think we should use the Facial Action Coding System to read childrens emotions expressions in school because what if the student didn't want the teacher knowing how he or she is feeling for personal reason? If we did that without permission it can lead to privaticy being broken and the students would probably feel uncomfortable. I also think we should use this because the passage says if a student looks bored or confused the Facial Coding can identifiy the problem and it can make the lesson eaiser for the student. The Facial Coding could also be useful because if a student is feeling depressed the machince can identify that and the student can get the help that he or she needs. We don't want students walking around school feeling that way because that can lead to decicions that a student wouldn't usually make if they were happy. Maybe we should get the Facial Coding System in our school systems.
