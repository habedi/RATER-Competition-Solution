i think that it could be used in class rooms so that way teachers and other students know what kind of mood the student is in so that way when they go to talk to someone they dont talk to somebody that is mad and the student that is mad say something rude to the person that is trying to be nice and just see how there day is going and i also think it can be usefule for students that are sad so that was school counseilers can talk to them and maybe see what is going on with the student maybe they are being bullied or maybe they just have some personal things going on at home so all around i just think that it can be usefule i mean im sure there would be times its not usefule because maybe people dont want to share there emotions with teachers but not only teachers but other students maybe they dont like people knowing there busness because i know a lot of people thats like that, that holds everything in and never talkes about there problems because they are scared or they dont want people to jude them witch i could understand that cause thats almost all anybody dose is juge and think that they are better or that they are perfict but there not but i do think that it can be usefulle.
