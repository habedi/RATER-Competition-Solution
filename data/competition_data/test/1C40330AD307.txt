What my position is on drverless cars are that they are not a bad thing, but everything has a good and a bad. I personally think that driverless cars are not bad because you can save more lifes. Driverless cars are one big step into the future.

Driverless cars can save lives, think of this what if you get an emergancy text and you need to pick it up but your driving and dont want to look at your phone and crash, a driverless car can eleminate one of thoes big task. It could also save you money insted of drinking and driving and having to spend money on a a taxi home you can save money by geting into your car and not having to drive at all. Driverless cars can also help lift a huge weight off your sholders when it comes to long distance travel.

I also think that driverless cars can help people double tasking like if you need to do something else and cant drive or pullover because your in traffic.

driverless cars can also be a bad thing to, like what if your in traffic and you car doesnt stop because it cant stop, and your to busy reading that text or answering the phone, you might crash into people. Driverless cars can also be a bad thing for taxi drviers because people simply won't need them and they would start to lose jobs. Another thing is that people might get to distrated and end up crashing and hurting themself and others. One more thing about driverless cars is that who's to blame if you do crash? Would it be you or the manufaturer?

Driverless cars are soon to be here even if it's a bad thing or a good thing. automakers are starting to make driverless cars apear more often now. The story said by 2020 more driverless car will be poping up.
