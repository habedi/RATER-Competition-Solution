I agree to the decision of every students having at least one extracurricular activity in school. I feel as if this is and good way to promote students to be involved in school and be more active in school related activity's. Having the choice to choose something that teaches students life skills is a smart idea for students future to come. It will help them find their interest in things and lead them down a successful path. Some of activities the students can participate in would be things like different kind of sports,year book staff,or even a school council.

I also think that if all students are required to take an extracurricular activity then it would help with the student social development with other students or friends. It would take major role in how the students are involved in their school. Doing this would help in their path to a great future because it will allow them to work great with others and work outside of the students regular working environment. Requiring something like this in schools is a big step but in the long run I feel it will help the students grow to a successful person. Lastly I agree to the fact extracurricular should be required for the reason stated above.

The reasoning for extracurricular activities helping social development is it gets you involved with other students just as a job would for you but with employees instead. It would also help guide students threw a better path because it will help them have things similar to common life situations. Extracurricular activities are usually things such as sports or staff members but there is so much more to it is helps lead success toward the students here and promotes a better future toward students at Generic_School. In the result of having extracurricular activities I feel it would make it easier for students to have a better mind set about a job in the future. It would also help them be already prepared for lives situations one step at a time.

To conclude I agree to the statement that we should be required to have an extracurricular activity at school. Generic_School would benefit in ways of students future and later succession in the world. It might seem that just a simple sport isn't going to make you successful but it will give you abilities needed to make you successful in the later future of your career. These things are things such as your ability to work outside of your comfort zone and your social effort toward fellow employees. Even though it might seems that extracurricular activities wont do those kind of things it will and thats why I agree to the thought of having extracurricular activities at Generic_School.
