I think that driverless cars would be a bad idea. I say this because people got their license for a reason, so they could drive. It says in the text that it would alert the driver when to take control, what if the person sitting in the drivers seat wasn't paying attention and the car wrecked? Then what would happen? My third reason is it would cost a lot of money to make all of the driverless cars, what if people didn't like them? Then manufacturers wasted all their money and time building them.

I think driverless cars is a bad idea. A lot of people went and got their license so THEY could drive, not to have some car drive. I think people would much rather drive their car themselves because if someone else driving wasn't paying attention they could crash cars in the driverless car. Anything could happen since there isnt anyone to pay attention in the driverless car.

The driverless car idea is bad for another reason because in the text it says the car will alert someone if they need to take control. What if someone doesn't respond to the alert right away? Then they could crash into a person or thing. People would have to pay attention at all times and that just gives me another reason to stick to cars with drivers. When you drive a normal car you have to pay attention all the time so I would just stick with that car.

My last reason on why driverless cars are a bad idea is that what if a lot of people ended up not liking them? Then the manufacturers would have just wasted all of their time and money on the cars. The manufacturers should have a test car before making a bunch, to see how people feel about them.

I think driverless cars are a bad idea because people got their license for a reason, people wouldn't be paying attention at all times, and people could end up not even liking them.
