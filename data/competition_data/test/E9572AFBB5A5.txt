Dear Principal,

I think that students should be required to do community service because helping others is a good way to build character.

Doing community service makes you feel good about yourself because you have helped accomplish something or make a needed change in your community.

It is good to help people that are less fortunate than you because it shows you're caring and compassionate.

Helping people in the community will show students what other people have to go through and deal with, which will help them to be less selfish and not take so many things for granted.

I think students should be required to do around 2-3 hours of community service annually because if students have sports or other after school activities they might not have a lot of time to perform community service.

I think every student is perfectly capable of performing a couple hours of community service.

Students should do a type of community service that helps a topic or idea that interests them.

For example if a student likes animals they could volunteer at an animal shelter or if the student enjoys cooking they could volunteer at a soup kitchen.

Students may think that performing a little community service won't help change the world at all, but even helping someone in a small way can make a big difference.

Helping your community will make students better, more admirable and more respected people.

Students who volunteer when they're young are more likely to continue volunteering when they're an adult.

Then when they get married or have children they can show them how good it is to perform community service.

Students should be required to do community service because I believe it will help them become a better person.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
