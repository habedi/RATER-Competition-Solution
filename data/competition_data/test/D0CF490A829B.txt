dear mr senator, i dont think the electoral college should be the middle man in our presidency voting system.

"60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." you see, a candidate could win the popular vote and still lose the presidency, and that is a problem. and the electoral coolege still has its defenders? personally to me it makes no sence, its not fair for those who run and the electoral college gets paid to literally just represent a group of peoples vote. i think the electing system is flawed and i think it may be time for a change to accur in the american voting system.

"under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate elector" i just think that citizens should vote for the presedent not for their electors. the system would be so much more simple and easy this way. on the contast the electoral college has always worked for all these years but that doesnt mean its not time for a change, everything and everyone needs a change once in awhile and this is the change that the united states of america needs.

thank you for your time mr. senator, that is why i think we dont need a electoral college.
