Learning in person is better than learning threw a screen. Some schools are now offering a new way of learning from home by the means of online or video conferencing. Some say that this new form of teaching is much more better than learning in person. However, this is far from the truth. Learning at school is better than learning at home. Not only can students get better help on a problem, but students will also be able to build social skills.

Students can ask for help. Let's say a student is stuck on a math problem. If they need help with a certain part of the problem they'll ask a teacher for help. The teacher then asks which part of the problem the student is having difficulty with and then they solve it together. If the teacher is busy the student can just ask another student for help. However, learning a lesson online eliminates this all. Since the teacher and other student are eliminated, if the student is stuck on a problem they'll probably get a flimsy push forward on the problem via the program. Technology just hasn't developed yet for a student to get the proper help in person. All in all it's much more beneficial to communicate your problems than to not be able to talk about them at all.

Students will be able to communicate with others during at school. Students behind a monitor will not be able to talk to other students during a lesson. Once a student builds charisma during their childhood it stays with them for the rest of their life. This will help them secure that dream job during an interview because employers want a confident and easy to talk to employee. They also can't talk to the teacher about extending a late assignment. Let's say on the online course there would be a test in 4 days. If the student suddenly gets a disease and has to be hospitalized then there's nothing he/she can do. Another resource that a teacher has other than help is empathy. A teacher can realize that the student was indeed sick and they can reschedule a test or assignment.

Some people might say that by learning online, students will be less prone to bullying. This is true; however, students that don't grow an immunity to bullying now will become even more prone to it later in their lives. Toxic work environments, bosses that don't care about their employees, and other students in college; these will be there later in a students life. If they don't know how to deal with it now they'll never be able to deal with bullying later.

Learning at school is better than learning at home. Not only can students get better help on a problem, but students will also be able to build social skills. By asking the teacher and other classmates for help the student will stay determined and on par with the rest of the class. And by building their social skills, students will deal will bullying easier, and they'll be more approachable and confident for their future job. Now although we're beginning to step into a more safer and futuristic way of learning, we must also consider what we lose in the process. Unless future programs involve other students and live hands on teachers, then students can truly make the switch to online classes.
