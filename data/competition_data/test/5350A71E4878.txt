Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Have you ever been forced to do something you do not want to do? Well you are putting your students in that situation if you make community service mandatory. You must not require the students to perform community service. The reasons are students may not have the time to perform community service, the students are not forced to do anything they do not wish to do, and the some of the parents will disagree if the operation is carried any further.

One of the reasons students should not be forced to perform community service is the students may not have the time to . Students have a life outside of school. If its sports, piano lessons, or doctors appointments. If the student misses one day because of those examples, the students will somehow be punished. It may be getting discipline for the teacher of losing credit.

Another reason students must not be forced to perform community service is students are not forced to do anything the do not wish to do. This is America, the land of the free, and the home of the brave. People have a choice if they want to perform community service. Why can't students have this same choice? They will also be adults some day. Some people may say since they go to school they must perform community service. But community service is not a written law. Until community service is a written law like school is,I am not forced to perform anything i do not wish to.

The final reason why students shouldn't be forced to perform community service is what the parents may say about this. Most parents will agree with this, but some will not agree with this. one or two parents may refuse their child to perform community service. The only thing that will do is hurt the student. He of she will get punished for not doing this requirement and be put in an alternative call. The student will also get bullied. The student will be look differently if he of she doesn't participate and some students will bully this student for something that is not his or her fault. Those are the reasons why the students shouldn't be forced to perform community service, the students may not have time, students are not forced to do anything they do not want to, and some parents will not agree with this requirement if it is carried on.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
