The Face in the picture was not created by aliens but just a natural landform. Tons of people believe it was created by aliens. In some ways I guess it could look like it was created by them. But in the end it was just a natural landform. A great deal of scientists strongly believe that it was not an alien.

An enormous head nearly two miles end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when they saw the photo. But common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Even though few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, capturing Cydonia in pictures became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet. Oodles of people started paying more attention to this story once it got out there.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. There are so many facts and details to show it actually was just a face and not aliens. My conclusion is that I believe it was just a natural landform rather then aliens.
