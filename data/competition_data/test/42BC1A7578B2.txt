Having students, required to complete summer projects to keep the previous school year material fresh on there minds so it isnt forgotten is a really good idea, and giving the students the option to come up with their own projects will be enticing to the students. If the students are allowed to come up with there own projects over the summer it gives them the chance to be creative and can motivate them to get more projects done before the summer ends thus meaning the students will know more material of the previous year, and will be more benefit them more when they are in the class rooms next year. Also it may help the students to be able to think on there own and be more independent if they have to be, and this will be prefect practice for that. As well of the learning aspect if the students are able to come up with there own projects this will be a chance to have fun which is what every student wants to do with there summer vacation

When the students come up with there creative ideas for there projects they maybe can find a way to get there family involved to so they can have quality family time while they get there projects done. Which is honestly what summer is mostly about for students summer is about family so if they can come up with ways to get there families involved and get there work done its a win win situation. This can also be a motivational thing the students use to get there work done or make it something they look forward too instead of dreading doing it. This is also a chance for their families to get in on the fun and learn too which could help younger siblings as they grow up and already know the material because of there older siblings projects they have done over the summer vacation. Having them make their own projects they have the option to make it less dull for example if they are doing a science experiments the family can go outside together and get some fresh air and learn.

Giving the students the chance to come up with their own projects will challenge the students and will help with their problem solving skills which is a very helpful thing to known. Giving the students this challenge wont be easy for them but it will make them think harder which will teach them not to give up on a assignment, and that will be a very important life lesson to learn. The projects are more then just making sure the students dont forget all there material its also has the ability to teach them other lesson that they need to know going though life. These projects not only challenge the mind but will also test their respoabilty to get them done before the summer is over. So if they can come up with their on projects to do it would be easier to come op will a schedule which will make sure they have enough time to research what they came up with and pack in more knowledge that perhaps they didnt know about.

Some might say that giving the students the chance to come up with their own projects isnt the right way to go about because the students would find easy loop holes or take the easy way out when doing them which would cause them to learn less but thats not the case if the students are able to come up with their own projects it would give them a chance to learn something new that they enjoy or they could go back and learn something that was hard for them during the school year and figure out a way to understand that topic better because they decided to go back and base one of their projects on that subject. Which would really be a confident boost going back to school also some maybe ahead of other could go the extra mile and start basing some of there projects on the material that they will be learning the next school year so they could be a little more ahead or gain that confidence to take that AP class they were considering taking.

In conclusion giving the students the chance to come up with their own summer project will be more helpful then just educational reason it will help them learn life changing lesson, and also will allow them to spend the summer having fun with their families and learning with them, and will allow them to be creative and have fun while learning. It also gives them the chance to go back and finally master that really tough subject that they didnt understand last year because they took the time to dedicate one of their projects to do so,and gives the students the chance to prepare for there classes coming up by already researching and learning about it during the summer it will also maybe help them look forward for there summer projects they can create coming up for next summer.
