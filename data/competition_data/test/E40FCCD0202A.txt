Should distant learning be offered for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? Yes, because this option would benefit students who can't/ aren't allowed to leave their homes by engaging them in the same material someone would learn in a physical classroom. Distance learning could also benefit people in more rural or remote areas who don't have access to a proper classroom education. On the other hand, students could take advantage of online classes in a negative way. Distractions like video games, hanging out with friends, and sleeping in are some ways online learning can be taken advantage of, and that student is not getting a proper education nor benefiting from online learning.

Distance learning can benefit people everywhere and give people a proper education without leaving their home. The people looking into distant learning are people who can't leave their home, people in remote areas, and students who just don't want to go to a physical school. Students on house arrest or incarcerated could get an education without posing a threat to themselves or others. Also, educating people that are in prison could greatly help them when they finish their sentence. Having a high school or college degree would allow them to get a job, stay on the right path, and not end up back in jail. Students with a disability who cannot leave their home can benefit in the same way and receive a proper education without leaving the comfort of their home. Lastly, people in remote or rural areas who don't have access to a physical school building could also get an education they would not have gotten without distant learning.

On the other hand, students could take advantage of online classes in a negative way. Distractions pose to be the biggest issue because it prevents students from getting the full learning experience by taking their focus away from the material. Electronics are the biggest issue, because everyone in today's world has a smart phone or laptop, and they are always glued to it. When you are at home there won't be a teacher there to tell you to get off your phone or take it away, and a lack of authority will make it easy to lose focus and not pay attention to the material. lastly, not having to wake up every morning to take the bus or drive to school will allow you to sleep in, this will most likely promote laziness and destroy your work ethic.

In conclusion, distance learning will benefit people who can't leave their home, in jail, use it properly, be attentive, and have self discipline by staying away from distractions. But for people that want to take advantage of online learnign in a negative way can do it at the cost of their own education.
