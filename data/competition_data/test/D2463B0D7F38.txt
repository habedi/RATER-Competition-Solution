Phones and driving?

Do you think anybody that ever hit someone while being on the phone and driving thought that they were actually going to HIT SOMEONE?!? No. It happens instantly, you won't even expect it. People should not be able to be on their phone no matter what they're doing while driving. Phones become a distraction and can have you hurting someone innocent in the blink of an eye.

The National Safety Council says that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Many people die and others are in critical condition. All because you had to send one text? Answer one phone call? Take a selfie? Neither of those are worth it when it come to one's life. That's not all though, According to statistics texting and driving are 6x more likely to get you into a car accident than driving drunk. Why is this? While under the influence of alcohol you are in the wrong state of mind but you still have the slightest ability to remain focused when being on your phone you become distracted. Many believe that we can multitask but according to nsc. org that is a myth. Our brain does not have the ability to multitask instead " the brain handles tasks sequentially, switching between one task and another. Brains can juggle tasks very rapidly, which leads us to erroneously believe we are doing two tasks at the same time. In reality, the brain is switching attention between tasks - performing only one task at a time."

There are other ways that you can void out using your phone and driving but buying things like bluetooths. You can talk on the phone without tampering anything or taking your eyes off the roads. Cars has also been more modernized to help fight this problem for example according to huffingtonpost. com "Ford's SYNC operating system, for example, sends texts dictated by the driver and reads incoming texts aloud; its MyKey feature allows parents to block calls and texts when teens are driving. GM is reportedly developing eye-tracking technology that can detect when drivers glance away at a text. Earlier this year, BMW unveiled plans for gesture controls that will allow drivers to point at the vehicle's navigation screen to take a call." Even phones are being update as to where you can text and navigate through your phone while not looking and being on it. These adjustments are not being made for nothing. Take advantage because using your phone while driving is not dangerous to only someone else but to you as well!

In Conclusion we should not be allowed to use our phones while being behind the road no matter what we're doing. It is simply dangerous and is a big distraction to the human brain. We can hurt ourselves and others in the blink of an eye over something that can be ignored until we get to our destination.
