Changing school policy to requiring students to have a grade B average to participate in sports would make school athletes try harder in school but would also cause some kids to drop from sports. Many students would be unhappy with this new policy. Kids have been doing fine maintaining a C average in classes, for some students it may be even difficult to maintain a C average to participate in a sport or school activity and changing the policy to a B average requirement would make it even more difficult. The schools academic system is just as important as its student activity and sport system.

The school policy should be that in order to participate in a sport or any other school related activity student must have at least a passable grade or better which is a grade of a C or higher. I don't think that students need to be proficient or above in there classes to play a sport or participate in a activity, because most students have classes where they are good and some classes where they're bad and the students shouldn't have to be punished for that one bad class they have just because they don't have a B average. Changing a C to a B could be a big deal for some students so the new policy of a B grade average wouldn't be a good thing for most of the students in the school with a grade C average.

I hope the principle would leave the policy the way it is and not make a new one because I participate in a sport and having B grade average wouldn't be difficult but to many of my teammates it would probably cause them to drop the sport for certain classes that they have been doing well in but not well enough to have a B average to play a sport.

If this new policy is passed you can go fuck yourself :)
