Projects for kids during the summer should be designed by the students. The reason why I say this is because kids can come up with better ideas for themselves and the teacher might do to much for the project. students work better when they are by themselves and also think better because they are not distracted as much.

Me Personally when teachers give projects they give us boring ones or things that are to hard to think about sometimes or either the person your working with doesnÃÂ´t know it and you have to do it by your self basically.

if we get to pick our own project it will be more creatitive because we have our own ideas and pictures we can use for it.

If the teacher would of assigned the project we would have to follow their rules on the project in every order. I would not want to do it because we cant do anything we want on it. Also what if the teacher give us a project that we needed lots of research for? It would take a long time to finish and make our summer shorter because were doing a long project.

My honest opinion is that if a teacher gives a project atleast make sure its fun for the students and not something that they know we donÃÂ´t want to do at all theres no point of giving it to us.

Overall it would be better if the students made the project instead of the teacher because we have our own ideas
