We can all help participate in helping other countries that are not our own. Though there is no war happening such as WWII, there are still other countries that need help. Seagoing Cowboys are a great way to help other countries. We get more freedoms than any other country. So, we should help by becoming Seagoing Cowboys.

We should all be helpful. Though our country is in lack of willingness to help, doesn't mean we shouldn't help. To be more factual we should all be willing to become a Seagoing Cowboy. You don't just get the privelage to help people in need, you get to see other parts of the world, you may never see otherwise! Also, don't you just want the feeling of knowing that you are saving peoples lives? That you are making a difference in the world? On the contrary, it could be fun as well. You can play games and, get to know some really great people.

We should all be exited to become Seagoing Cowboys because, it would be such a great experience. I don't have a doubt in my mind that this would be very fun for all ages. The joy, exileration, and pleasure of doing this grand act of kindness. So become a Seagoing Cowboy, for the people that need you most.
