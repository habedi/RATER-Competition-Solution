My claim is that this facial coding system would be good for working situations. This technology would be good for anywhere that needs work or effort. this is because everyone gets bored or tired of somthing and it might even be their job ,it states in this article that it can modify the lesson and this would keep you interested in what you are learning. this technology would come in handy to see when someone is putting on a fake "happy face" so you could see if they are acting the way they truely and actually feel. when making a fake smile a muscle in the face called the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sideways these are clues that can lead to seeing if someones emotions are not real. My conclusion to this article is that the Facial Action Coding System will come super handy if your teaching or trying to learn,this is because it will change the questions or prompt to help you interpret the text more easily, in the end helping you learn.
