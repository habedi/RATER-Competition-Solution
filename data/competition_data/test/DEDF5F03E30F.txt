The Idea that schools would give you a summer project to do over your break is absurd, but if it is required i feel as if it should be teacher designed. If students had controll over their projects, not only would they not get done, we wouldn't actually be learning anything.

Students when it comes to summer break the last thing you want to do is a school project; it honestly defeats the whole point of the break, but some schools do require for you to do a project over the summer because they want you to continue learning and to make sure you're prepared for next year. Students shouldn't be in charge of their projects, students if put in charge of something will do it with no will power and make it easy just so they can get it done and go on about their summer. If the schools idea is to make sure you retain information and to learn, the Teachers should be making the projects, teachers will make sure we are actually learning and doing something that will have us thinking instead of a student who will take a paper and write each vocab word 5 times as a project.

However, some will say "not all students slack on their projects" and thats true some wont ,but most will and thats the problem, almost all students if assigned their own project to create, just simply wont do it. I can't blame them though because if i had to create my own project with no assist i'm not even going to try. Plus 9 times out of 10 if a teahcer assigns a project to you it is going to be graded which also makes more students work harder because NO ONE wants to start off their school year with a 50 then have to work twice as hard just to get it up, when you had 3 months to do it.

Furthermore, if you are assigned a project for class by your Teacher just do it cause if u had to create one yourself you know in the back of your head you're not going to do it. Your not going to even try, but your Teacher will, they will make sure you are learing and getting information and will even do things to make sure you get the project done, yes teachers are irritating but i promise they aren't doing these things to ruin your summer, they are just trying to help.
