We as people get dumb, it's true, over a period of time we get dumber. To counter-act this problem schools started to assign projects over the summer to keep student learning. When I was in high school we had a huge summer break project, thankfully in my case it was a group project, but what was interesting is that our teacher asked if we, the students, design the project or if the teachers do. Some may believe that it would be better to let the students design these, but it's better if the teachers do because you will get good practice, you dont have to do work designing it, and it will help you in the future.

One reason why teachers should design these summer projects is because you would get good practice. After a long break I sometimes have trouble getting the mindset ready to learn again, I often don't pay attention after a break because I am still in that kind of mind set. If teachers assign these projects, with their ideas, it would help me get ready for the school year. It is better for the teachers to design these instead of the students because they hand out good hard working projects, if students made these I fear they would make it too easy so they can get it over and done with.

One other reason why teachers should design summer projects is because, well so they have to make it and we don't. I am going to be honest, nobody likes to do a summer project, they may be helpful but they are boring, so why should students waste more time designing the projects, then have to do the actual thing. It would be better for the teachers to make these so students don't waste more working time designing these. If teachers made the project then the students can give their full attention into completing it, not creating it. For example, when I had to do a summer project, I had the luxury of focusing only working on the project; while my friend, who goes to a different school, had to design their own. He told me that it was harder because he worked hard designing it and got really tired just from designing.

One final reason why teachers should design summer projects is that it will help you in the long run. For me, I was one of the top workers because in my job they require you to work at all times, even during your breaks. Thanks to school, with my teacher giving me a summer project, since they designed the project, it was a good hard working one made my an adult. This helped me practice doing projects over breaks so I was able to do wellÂ in the future. Again, if students made this they would most likely make the projects easy. If students made things easy for themselves, it wont help them in the future. If their future job required them to work all the time, they would struggle at first because they made it too easy for themselves and their job would want them to do adult level work.

Some might say that letting the students design summer projects is the right option; however, it is better to let the teachers make them because you would get good practice, you don't have to waste time designing the project, and it will help you in the future.
