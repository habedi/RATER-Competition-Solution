Cars. Mostly everyone has been in a car, had a car or most definetly seen a car. They're part of our culture, so deeply engrained that we buy our homes and plan our lives around the commutes we use to go about our lives but recently, cities around the world have been questioning our dependance and need for cars, especially considering the damage they do to our environment. However, the environment doesn't concern the man or woman that is trying to get to work, so what are the other benefits of not having a car? Well, closer locations, a peaceful life style and a close knit community are also elements that come with a world where cars aren't the norm.

For those who think practically, not having a car is a hassel but the thing is that cities that have already implemented this change. Locations are put closer together so that you may only need a car to get to the next city and even then alternate transportations are put in place to help with that. For example Vauban, Germany has completely given up their cars, except for a few placed in choice parking spaces at the edges of the town. Inside the community people ride their bicycles and there are shops placed at close intervals
