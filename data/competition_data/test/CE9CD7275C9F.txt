As a student growing up I've always wondered what it would be like if I could make my own summer project; instead of my teachers always making them. When it comes to summer projects, many people dispute whether or not, should students design said projects or should the teachers. If students designed their own summer projects they'd only pick what they're good at. They wouldn't pick what they struggle with, like a teacher would, so you can better yourself for the next level.

Me personally, I would say summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers pick what you need to work on to improve yourself, they actually know the curriculum and what you need to know for the following year, and they give you the work to help you; not to hurt you.

See, teachers actually know the curriculum and what they're teaching; so when they assign you these summer projects they're just trying to prepare you for the next step. When they give you all this extra work, or at least what seems like extra work, they are just doing it to prepare you for what comes next. Teachers just want to see you do better and use what you learned from them to excel at the next stage. Summer projects are used for teachers to gauge what you learned from them and to see if you can use it on "foreign" material that you've never seen before. They do this because they want to see you win.

Another thing for why I say that these summer projects should be teacher designed is because when create these things; they pick what you need to better yourself. Like for instance one time when I was in the 6th grade going to the 7th grade; my teacher assigned me this big summer project. Everyone else in my class didn't have to anything as big, they all got little miniature projects to do. At first I thought my teacher was doing it out of spite and hatred for me. I almost started crying, but then I asked her when school was over, why my packet was one of the biggest ones out of everyone else. She looked at me and said the only reason my packet was one of the biggest in the class was because she believed in me and I was one of the smartest kids in the class; and that I could actually complete the whole thing if I put my mind to it. I almost agreed with her but then I asked how come I can't have a smaller one and she told me I could choose if I wanted to do this one or make a smaller one for myself. I almost went along with that for a second, but then I thought about just because I could pick what I wanted to work on, would that really benefit me in the long run. After I sat and thought about that for a second I just decided to roll with bigger packet because all my teacher was trying to do was help me better myself for the next level.

The final reason for why I say teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects is because they give you the work to help you, not to hurt you. I only say this because why would a teacher intentionally give you work they know you can't do unless they know you can do it if you put your mind to it. The only reason they give out summer projects is to help you. All this extra work is used to benefit you in every way possible. I used to think it was used to just make us not be able to have a fun summer; until I actually sat down and did it and then by the time the new school year came around, I already knew all the stuff they were teaching for the first semester.

So, in conclusion when it comes to summer projects, let students tell it, they should be the ones to design it. But, all in all teachers should be the ones to design it because they do it to benefit you in the long run, they know what you'll need for the next year, and last but not least they pick what you need to become a better you.
