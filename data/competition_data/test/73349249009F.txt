You are not the only one who believes that the "Face on Mars" is real. Many people around the world have believed that the image we released of the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth is in fact a face, but they are wrong.

I was one of the men on Michael Malin's Mars Orbiter Camera team and I took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos that were released. The pictures clearly showed that the "Face on Mars" was a natural landform and not an alien monument after all.

Some people still believed that there was a Face and the reason that it looked like a natural landform and not a face was because it was winter where the Face was located and it was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face and they thought that the alien markings were hidden in the haze. On April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveryor came close enoough for a second look and this time it was a cloudless summer day.

My team captured an amazing picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared ot 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking picture. What the picture acually showed was the Martian equivalent of a butte of mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.
