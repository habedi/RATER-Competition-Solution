We live in a world where transportation is a must and most of the people around the world rely on themselves to get from A to B. Don't get me wrong there are some that choose public transportation opposed to privet/self transportation. They both have something in common, both are adding more pollution to the air, car accidents have the number one death rate, and they both add to taxes. Many countries are comeing up with a solution to all of these problems. Most countries are wanting to cut down the amount of automobiles their citizens are using on a day to day basis. Here are some reasons this could be benificial to you! Cutting down the amount of automobiles being used on a daily basis would take less money out of yor pocket and would be better for the enviroment, and it would be healthier and safer.

More and more countries are taking action to stop the large amout of cars being used daily. One way they are doing this is by having car-resticted areas, like in Vauban, Germany, "Vauban streets are completely car-free...", (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal). By doing so, you wouldnt use your car very often or at all. This will reduced the amout of money you will have to spend on gas, car repair, or it could cut out the cost of buying a car entirely. More and more people will not have a need to buy/use a car and that will be extremely benificial to the Earth. This is because their will be less pollution and smog being produced by the running cars. Pairs, France is a big contributer to smog and they are now reducing the amount of allowed cars on their roads, "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party...",(Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog,Robert Duffer). Paris has now lowered the amount of smog in their cities signifigantly.

With less pollution and smog life for the people will be a lot healthier. Just think about how much cleaner the air will be. Also, by not using a car you could walk or bike to your destinations and that will also be very benificial to your health. By not using cars, public thransportation, or just staying off the road in general you are cutting out the risk of being in a deathly car accident. By doing so life will be much safer. You will also cut out the stress and worry of driving. "...When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,...", (Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal).

In the end, cutting down the amount of car and public transportation being used will be very benificial to everyone of all ages because it will take less of your money to get to your destinations and will cause less pollution which is better for the Earth, and it is much safer to be off the road ,as well as, healthier to walk or bike to your destinations.
