You get in a car and drive/ get driven around about every day. You may not notice what this means but it means a lot about the future. Driving cars pollutes the atmosphere that you live in. You may think driving a car is good because you get there faster but in reality its polluting our atmosphere with toxins, it's effecting the greenhouse effect. We should limit our car usage to a minimum to protect the earth.

First if we limit our car usage, the Earth would be a better place. Like in paragraph 5 it states that, cars are responsible 12% of greenhouse gas in Europe and about 50% in the U.S. In other words this means that car usage contribute to air pollution a lot. Also if we can limit our car usage this percent can decrease a lot and make the earth less polluted.

Paragraph 3 reads, "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Which shows that if you limit your car use, you may become less tense with cetian things and become les stressed out, which makes a happier you. Also, paragragh 24 reads, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution...." this shows that if you can just can find another way someplace like a bike or a bus that it would be better for you because you wont be so stressed out and you can relax and enjoy yourself like never before.

In conclusion, limiting your car usage will protect mother earth. This matters because what if the earth is not like how it is when your heirs come into the world. so don't drive around to much for the earth can remain how it is.
