Ever since the invention of the flip phone people have been texting and driving. This is an issue because well frankly it is dangerous. People who text and drive are more likely to cause a crash. Even if it is an emergency it still is not right to text and drive. In my opinion i do not think it is right to text and drive.

People should never be allowed to text while driving because it can cause crashes and even kill bystanders. When a person is going 50 mph and you look down at your phone your traveling 150 feet without control. In the state of Georgia you can get a ticket and a fine up to 25$ first time offender and 150$ for every other time you are ticketed plus one point against their driving record(1). If a person who was texting and driving causes a crash they could be charged with murder if the passenger or driver of another car is killed.

On the other side, during an emergency it is not right to send a text but it can be omitted in extreme situations. If you absolutely need to send a text but it is not an emergency, just pull over and send it. You could even get your passenger (if your with someone) to send it and save a life.

In conclusion, texting while driving is bad because you can kill others and ruin people's lives. When your in an emergency you should pull over and send it so you do not get a ticket. You can be fined or even put in jail for breaking this law.
