The author does a good job supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author explains how Venus is the most similar planet to Earth.

The author also points out that Venus is sometimes Earths closest neghboring planet which would help with the time of space travel. It is made clear in the artical that scientist want to learn more about Venus and that the author supports them, now lets see examples the author gives us to support these claimes.

In the artical "The Chanllenge of Exploring Venus" the author describes how Earth and Venus are the two most similar planets, as shown in the text "Astonomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." This exerpt shows that Venus is a very special planet that needs to be reserched even though it is dangerous. In the artical the author says Venus is sometimes the closeset planet to Earth making space travel easier. "Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."

The last point I have is it is clear that scientist and the author both share in the fact that they think it is important to learn more about Venus, an example of this in the text is "Striving to meet the challenge ppresented be Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." That exerpt shows how not only the author feels but also how scientist feel about exploring Venus.

I think it is clear that the author has done a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. The author used several different examples listed in the before paragraphs to show how the reward was greater than the risk.
