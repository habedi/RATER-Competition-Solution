The Mona Lisa is said to have many different emotions. Eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. Due to a new computer software, from Professor Thomas Haung of the Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the University of Illinois and Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam, we can calculate the emotions of people and how much of certain emotions they are feeling at the time. I believe this software can be very helpful to people in many different fields: in an office, at a restaurant, and especially in classrooms.

This new technology can be a very helpful tool in teaching all different types of students at their pace instead of teaching a specific groap of kids at one pace. In a classroom, it can be very intimidating and nerve recking to raise your hand and be the only one with a question. With the new software, the computer will detect if the child needs help or not by the facial expressions he, or she, makes and explain the lesson in a way that child would understand. Also, it can help teachers with the way they teach and the way they give out work. Since the computer can detect emotions, it can also detect they way the children are responding to the way the teacher is teaching and the homework he, or she, is giving them.

In conclusion, I think the bnew software will be very helpful, especilally in schools. It could be both beneficial to students and teachers and help strengthen the education systems. Most kids do not like to learn because it is too hard and because they can not comprehend it, but if learning could be made more understandable, or easier, lack of a better term, then a greater amount of students would be more open to learning and actually trying in school.
