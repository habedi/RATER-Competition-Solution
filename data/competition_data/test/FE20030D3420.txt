Phones and Driving

Many people have the bad habit of using their cell phones while they're driving every time they step into a car to drive somewhere. Both teens and adults have this habit and most drivers are aware that it is not a good habit to have. They could be texting people, calling people, getting on social media, etc. However, using a cell phone while driving is a huge distraction to the driver which is why it is such a bad habit to have. There are plenty of reasons as to why people should not use their phone while they're driving and why it's so dangerous to do so. If people are on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn't do it.

Since some people go on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident. If a person causes a car accident because of being on their phone, it can cause harm and even death to the driver, the passengers in the driver's car, other people driving on the road, and even pedestrians. There are many handfree ways to use a cell phone while driving instead of having the phone in the hand of the driver. According to a website called driving-tests. org, it states, "Hands-free technology is easy to use and widely available." An example of a hands-free technology that people can easily use would be a phone holder. With phone holders, people can place their phone in the phone holder on the dashboard so they can answer phone calls, use their GPS, etc. If the people with the bad habit of using their phones while driving get a phone holder, it would decrease the chances of getting into a car accident which will benefit everyone.

Being on the phone while driving not only is very dangerous and unsafe, it is illegal in most states to have a mobile device in the hands on a driver. Having a mobile device in the hands of a driver at any age is illegal in 10 states while having a mobile device in the hands of a novice driver is illegal in 32 states. Since it is illegal in most states, the consequences could be getting a ticket, having to pay a fine, or possibly getting some jail time. There is a website called araglegal. com, and on the website it says, "Texting and driving makes a crash up to 23 times more likely." That is the reason it is illegal to even have a phone in the hand of a driver in some states because it results in bad consequences. To avoid bad consequences from happening, drivers can be smart to not even touch their phone while they're driving, they could easily pull over to use their phone instead of using it while driving, etc.

Many adults use their cellular device while they're driving and sometimes, they even do it with their kids in the car. Doing that sets a bad example and gives a horrible influence on kids.

When kids grow up and learn how to drive, they might use their phone while they're driving because they're going to think that it's okay since their parents did the same exact thing.

According to "4 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Text and Drive," it states, "Why wouldn't young drivers think it's okay to text and drive? They've seen other people do it, perhaps even their parents." That quote from the website explains the mindset of a young driver perfectly; Having this mindset as a young driver is not good to have because it can cause multiple consequences for them. So if adults don't use their phone while they're driving, especially when their kids are in the car, young drivers will make the smart decision and not be on their device while driving.

Almost everyone knows that it's dangerous to be on the phone while they're driving but people still do it regardless. It would make the world so much easier if people stayed off their phones while driving because there wouldn't be as many car accidents happening. Every driver needs to think about what would happen if they caused a car accident just because they were on their phone and driving at the same time. If someone caused a car accident because they were paying attention to their phone and not the road, and someone died, the person that caused the accident would feel so guilty. In conclusion, every driver needs to know the dangers of being on their phone while driving and why they shouldn't do it so there can be less car accidents. If people are on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn't do it.
