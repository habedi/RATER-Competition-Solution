The author do it a very good job, because, its very elaborate

Firts, the thougth of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not requiere electronics at all, and then maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down on Venus's in more thn three decades, numerous factors contribute, to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

my conclusion is this essay is very specific, because we need learn, about The Challenge of Exploring Venus.
