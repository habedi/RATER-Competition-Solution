Have you wanted a to hit a soccer ball and make a goal or win a debate tournament at your school. Students who want to try-out sports or debate find an extracurricular at their school. Having at least a extracurricular is a good idea to have when you are looking for something new at your school or club. Students who are engaged with the extracurricular are going to more focus on other topics. Extracurricular is a great way to keep students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends.

Having a extracurricular helps keep students active. Most students are on their phone all the time,so by having students participate in a extracurricular prevents them on their phone. I have done an extracurricular in my school, that has help forget about my phone and instead focus on more important on my softball team. Keeping students active on extracurricular helps them focus on the extracurricular they are doing. There so many different ways students can make themselves active for example sports and debate can encourage themselves to be active.

An extracurricular has different options to tryout. Trying out a extracurricular can be hard to choose. When you are trying out extracurricular you should find talents or skills that you are good at to find the perfect extracurricular. When I had to find a extracurricular I to choose activities that I am good at, or extracurricular that is joy able. Extracurricular is fun to explore out what kind of activities you are good and most joy able.

Socializing with your friends is fun when you can hang out with your friends in a extracurricular. Socializing with your friends can be extracurricular, for example like a girl or boy's club or a book club can be ways of an extracurricular. Another, way you can socialize with your friends is making new friends in extracurricular. You to meet other people that might want to be friends with. I have friends and made friends in a book club while talking about the book and relevant topics.

Having at least one extracurricular is a great to keep students active on the activity, finding different extracurricular's and socializing with your friends and making new ones. Keeping students active, trying out different extracurricular and socializing with their friends are different ways of enjoying extracurricular and engaging students to themselves the activity that their are really interest into. So what I think about students participating in a extracurricular in school is that students should have an opportunity to have at least one extracurricular.
