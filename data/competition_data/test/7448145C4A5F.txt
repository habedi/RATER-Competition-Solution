Dear principal,

I believe cell phones should be allowed in school. If I were the principal of the school I would choose policy 1. After all its only during lunch periods and other free times. Even teachers enjoy using their cell phones during school. I remember once my World History teacher TEACHER_NAME

used her cell phone in class, us kids thought it wasn't fair. So by allowing cell phones during lunch and free time would be awesome and make everything equal.

Also, what if theirs an emergency? It would be useful to have a cell phone. Many parents buy their children phones for that reason. Not only because their children want it but because they will be safer.

Calling to the office might take time since the staff members can be busy. On the other hand, calling your child will take only a minute of your time. Even parents in my neighborhood agree with me.

As the intelligent principal you are, i know you will choose policy 1. Try to put yourself in our shoes. If you did you would understand us as children. You were a child once, you should know how we feel. We like to talk to our friends and text them. They are one thing in our lives that make us happy. If were happy, the school is a better place. If the school is a better place, the world is a better place. What a spectacular world that would be. Think about the children!
