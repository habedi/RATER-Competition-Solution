If you want to be a helpful person who also wants to have a fun and hard working experience, come and sign up for Seagoing Cowboys.

I have had a great experience on the cattle boat and it also felt great helping others in need.

When you are on the cattle boat you will experience an oppertunity of a lifetime.

I think that the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable oppertunity for a small town boy like me.

I also think that besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

One time, I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

I also toured an excavated castle in Crete an marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

I also found to have some fun aboard, espeacially on return trips when the animals had been unloaded.

We played baseball and voleyball game in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

We also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. So as you can see, being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun and hard, but it is worth a shot.
