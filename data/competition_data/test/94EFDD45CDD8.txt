I disagree with the principal's decision to force the students to participate in extracurricular activities. The school can't please everyone with their clubs and some people will be mad about it such as: students, parents, and the teachers. Secondly, a lot of students are not comfortable with being in a groups of people. Finally, the students may not believe that clubs will help them with anything that they want to do in the future. They're many different ways to help get the students out of their comfort zones than trying to force them to do something they dont want to do.

First, no matter how hard you try there will always be somebody that will not be be please with the principal's decision. There is always gonna be that kid that will not want to apply to any of the clubs or teams because they doesn't find them interesting or they just dont want to do it. This decision can also make the parents and teachers very mad because this is messing with their schedule. Parents can be late for their night shift if their child is at a meeting for a club and the teacher will have to be looking after the kids while they are doing the meetings and that can cause them to loose time with their families. But, lets say the staff thought of all this and they are going to provide the students with all the clubs they want. There will still be problems because that means there will have to be more money spent on the clubs and teams that the school probably wont have.

Secondly, many people dont want to do something new because they are scared of the things that they will be exposed to socially. Many students are very awkward when it comes to social encounters. This can cause them to feel like they are being judged and that they are unwanted in that club. Even worse a bully may come about and pick on that student causing them to feel afraid and potentially making their anxiety worse. But, they can't do anything about it because they have to be in that club.

Finally, a lot of clubs won't help students accomplish what they want to accomplish in life. Unless the students want to be an athlete clubs or teams wont help you get the job that you want. Even though these clubs can help you get into a good college, which is important, it won't help the students with their people skills or how to be a better person. They will be in that team or club for one purpose and that purpose is what the club was made for.

In conclusion, even though you can benefit from this decision the smarter move is to let the students do what the want to do when it comes to extracurricular activities. No matter how flexible you try to make for everybody there will always be someone who will be mad with that decision. The school should just avoid the hassle and let the kids do what they want to do so everybody can stay happy. You know what they say, "If it's not broke don't fix it."
