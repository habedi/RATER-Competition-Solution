Has your school ever made you join extracurricular activities? If not that's totally okay! My school wants students to really get their hands on learning and exploring new things. Personally I think that's a great idea, because students are not only helping their selves stay busy but helping out their school. Because sometimes our school needs a little pick me up I think in some spots it could use a little makeover and that's okay. Some extracurricular activities you could do are, joining a sport, helping out with yearbooks and redecorate things, or you could even paint or rebuild some things too!

Joining a sport can take time away from doing homework or other things, but thats what being a student athlete is about! At some points it can be really rough and stressful but really it's preparing you for the stressful things in the future. You may not think joining a sport could help you or your school but in certain situations it really can. Some schools have put tons of money into sports like buying new equipment etc. So why not continue on of what people in the past have put money into. Joining sports can be a big deal but no matter what just think about how much you are helping out.

Another thing you could do is help out with yearbooks. Sometimes it can be really stressful for teachers, so why not lend another helping hand and see where it takes you. I mean you never know, they may really like the way you helped out and may ask you to do other things! You never know what the future holds. Not only can you help out with yearbooks, you could also help out by redecorating some things in your school. Just throw your opinion right in there! It could also turn into something you really enjoy and you could continue on with that. Then all you have left to do is say thank you to your principal.

If you enjoy painting or building and you want to help out, let someone know and your school can definitely help find something you can do to help. One thing you could build is a new desk for a teacher or if you have a civics teacher build them a stand so they can sit like a judge in court. You never know where this ability you have could take you so take it and roll with it. Also if teachers don't like their room color you could gather some other students and help repaint their classroom. See there is always an extracurricular activity for everyone! Don't give up on looking.

In so many ways you can help your school! That's why i totally agree with this decision that my principal has made. Because everyone gets a chance to show what they can do and how they can help. Sometimes you just have to throw your opinion in the mix and see what it turns out to be. This is why i love doing extracurricular activities! Show what you can do and do it. I believe in you!
