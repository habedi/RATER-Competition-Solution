Dear TEACHER_NAME

We are in the era of technology, and we depend on technology very much. Nowadays, it is rare to find a student without a cell phone. Students bring there cell phones to school even if they're not allowed, so I say that students should be allowed to use their cell phones during free time only. They should bring their cell phones for emergencies, help on assignments, and relaxation.

I myself have a cell phone, but I only use it after school to call my mom or sister, and I am sure that many other kids have a cell phone for that purpose too. I know that schools have plenty of phones available, but they might not let you use it unless it's a drastic emergency. I consider forgetting your homework or backpack an emergency, but the office may not think so. You may have ripped your pants, and you need to call home for some new ones. You don't was to be wearing ripped pants all day long.

My second reason for bringing a cell phone is that many cell phones have internet. The internet is useful when you are doing some last minute studying or you want extra help on an assignment. You may say that the internet provides websites that should not be used during school, but it's during free time, so they won't be disturbing the class. Free time may be boring, so you may want to go on a chatting site or play games on your favorite website.

Many cell phones have the ability to store music. Research shows that music encourages creativity and your imagination. You can listen to music before a writhing prompt or art class to get some ideas of what to paint or write about. This may improve your grade because the art or writing came easy to you. Music also helps some people concentrate on their work because it relaxes them. Kids that usually cause trouble can be relaxed and calm after listening to relaxing music.

As you can see, cell phones work for many purposes. They come in handy when you have an emergency, you need some last minute studying, or you just want to relax before a test. So come on TEACHER_NAME. How can you not allow cell phones after reading these reasons for allowing them.
