Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter in that the average grade for a sport or other activities should still be kept as a C grade average. Some people may think that a B grade average should be used for a student to participate on a sport team or in other activities. A B grade average is a average grade for a student while a C average grade is a passing grade for a class. If you would change the average grade for the students, you would be changing the child's life by not letting the child play a sport or participate in other activities with passing grades.

This policy change would make students lose interest in the idea of passing school to play on a sports team or participate in other activities if that student must have a B grade average. This would have more students drop out of high school because the student lost interest. On the other hand , this might give some students the motivation to pass their classes with a B grade average. This still may not be enough students to keep interest to pass school and participate on a sports team or in other activities.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
