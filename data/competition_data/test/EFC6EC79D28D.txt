Dear Principal,

I believe that you should allow students to bring their phones and use them during lunch periods and other free times. It is a much better policy that not allowing phones at all. Not allowing phones at all is bad idea because the students need their phones to contact their parents or anyone else. They need their phones in case of emergencies. The students will be very upset if you follow through with the no phones at all rule. The students would be much happier if you would allow them to use their phones during their free times. I think they would follow that rule way more then not being able to have their phones at all. Like I said before, the students need their phones in case of emergencies. What if something happens at home and their families can't get a hold of them? That would be a problem. So as you can see, allowing the students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times is a much better policy.

Sincerely,

A Student
