As I was reading the article " Driveless Cars Are Coming" I was thinking this can't be serious. This article was about smart cars and how they will improve. The article talks about how people that " drive" them will no longer need to pretty much drive, the cars will do it for them.

They claim it is still safe or even safer than a human driving but we have to think about cases that randomly occur, like someone that doesn't have a smart car running a light. What if it isn't your turn to drive so you see the car coming last minute but your on autopliot so you can't save a life or perhaps your own. The article gives a description about the features of the car. For instense one car, a Toyota Prius has position sensors on the left rear wheel, a video camera for tracking distance from other cars, and an inertial motion sensor etc. They claim that their cars are safe and only improving, but we should'nt add on to all the accidents, we already have so many a year and having to deal with technology gone wrong will not help us only hurt us.

I am currently against this development because I don't think it is a good fit or will add any good. The first reason I am against these cars is because in the article it says "laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident." also says, " if the techonolgy fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer"? these quotes show a strong idea of how much manufacturers care about the safety of people using their cars... not very much. They were implying that if an accident case acurres and someone is injured because of their technology messing up , they should'nt be held accountable. That is insane , they should take the responsiblity for what their product has done.

To conclude I am against driveless cars because they will create more issues, disadvantages than advantages. The smart cars aren't very safe and people that drive them are more prone to accidents from small altercations that may occur on the road. Also if you purchase a smart car and happen to get in an accident the manufacturers will not be liable, even if it is because of their cars.
