Should students learn online or home?

I disagree I think that students should attend classes from school instead of home. A lot of times when you take classes at home you get distracted and you are not motivated to do your work. When you are in a working environment you are motivated and ready to learn and do work. For example I took an online class and I realized I did better in a classroom than online. It was so much stress for me, I say this because I did not get most of the material, I was not spacing out my time nor planning out my time.

The benefits of attending school is the interaction. You get to be around your peers and even new people that you might not know. With interaction we build up the courage to talk and be in certain situations like teamwork or having a new partner. It even helps us with the real world and knowing how to deal with people. When you are online you don't have the same interaction than you do in person, with online you don't really know or understand the person or get the feel of that person.

One of the harder things can be being not able to not understand what you are learning. With learning online you have a harder time processing what you are learning than in a classroom. Online is more speeding than really learning the material while going to a school you have a face to face person that can guide you and lead you on the right direction. Now with online you have a person talking and looking at you and it can sometimes be confusing and not beneficial. Yes, you could ask questions to your online teacher but it may confuse you more or still might not get it.

In conclusion I would recommended students to attend school than to do online school. There are more benefits going to a classroom than online. You have more of a hands on experience and more of a reality of the world. Also you can get to engage and have a better knowledge for yourself and experience different things. Being in school can help for are well-being and are personal growth, sometimes being in school we get put into certain things but it helps us as we get older and make us realize how to do things when we are in uncomfortable settings.
