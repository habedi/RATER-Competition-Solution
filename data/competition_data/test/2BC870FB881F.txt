Have you ever wished you could help your nation, well I have a thing that you can do. I'm Luke, and i'm a Seagoing "Cowboy". Don't think that it's nasty to be a Seagoing "Cowboy", you get to do amazing stuff.

On the ship you get to take care of lots of animals, they're really fun to hang-out with. You get to take care of them for a living, how cool is that. Plus your helping your nation while your doing it.

There is also lots of time to sight-see the places you go. I toured a excavated castle in Crete, and was marvled when I saw the Panama Canal. All of it was really cool, but I only got to see it when I was a Seagoing "Cowboy".

You also get to do really fun stuff when the animals are deilvered. We played baseball, and had volleyball turnoments in empty stalls, Where the animals used to stay. We also had ping-pong and lots of other games we had fun with.

You also have different jobs like night-guard. I remember when i was on night-guard for the first time. Had some great adventures. My first night i was on the job, I broke a rib, be careful on slippery ladderes, very careful.

Being a Seagoing "Cowboy" is all fun and games, it's seirous busniess. You have to give the animals water 3-4 times a day. You have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats from lower holds of the ship.

You also want to be confident in yourself. If you say you can't do, Then you probley won't do it. Plus can't never did anything, but could tried because he could do it.
