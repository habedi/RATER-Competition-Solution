Cell Phone Policy

Dear, Principal

I go with policy one because we can use them though free time because what will happen if somebody trying to kidnap us we cant call no one because we didn't bring our phones to school. Another reason is what will happen if our parents is looking for us after school they cant find us cause you told us not to bring our cell phone it mate be a emergency and we cant call our parent because we don't have our cell phone. But the principal is right we cant use it in the class room because what happen if the teacher is teaching and the phone just ring your will disturb everybody in the classroom. then whoever found rung will get in trouble, and if you texting why the teacher trying to help you and he give you a text you want know what to do you will get bewilder you want know what to do or how to do it.
