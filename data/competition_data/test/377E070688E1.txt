I think that the school policy should change so that kids must have a "B" average to participate in sports because a is ok but they are not giving their best to their school work .Many kids to slack off a little if they be have a C average . Sports are not as important as school and if kids slack off even more on their grades when it already is a C then it just going to get worst and drop to a D .Then they are going to fail the class because kids need to maintain a C as the average grade to pass the class and that is barely passing. So it is just going to make the school look bad. I think that in order for kids to succeed in school is by them focusing on school work and taking care of their grades. Sports can be a good thing too sometimes because it helps the kids to get more exercise and start to help their muscles and brain to function better. I still agree that they should change the policy because it also is not fair when their are students who are making all A' s and still the kids who are barely making it to a C are allowed to play sports too. It's like their allowing someone to go in a party even though they didn't bring an invitation. They need to think about what is fair and what is right for the school. participate in sports average to
