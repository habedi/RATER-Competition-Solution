Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

My fellow schoolmates and I love to play sports. We play them all the time so we can get better and try out for the school's team. We have recently heard that you have been thinking about requiring all sports players considering trying out for the team to have above a "B" average. Well not all of us are happy about this, because it isn't that easy to maintain a "B" average for some people and it wouldn't be fair if that was the only reason holding us back from playing sports. Also making this decision would lower the amount of people trying out for the team, meaning we would have a less chance of having a good tem. And c'mon where's your school spirit.

Even though it is pertinent to your future to make good grades, and stay in school, you need some type of motivator to come and do well, and for some people that thing is sports. I feel you should keep the grade requirement down to a "C" average so we can stay active and off of the streets doing worse things than making C' s . I hope you come around to agreeing with me and most of my fellow student body members.

Sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME
