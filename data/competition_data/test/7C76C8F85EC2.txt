Dear Principal,

I don't see why we have to have a C average to attend any sports or meeting. A C average is still passing also the reason i say this is because its not fair to the students you are trying their best and making 75 and you still want them to keep on trying they will get there sooner or later if they still do their assignment's and other projects they will eventually pass the classes they are in and still be able to play the sports they love to play .That's my reason why i said, or complained, or maybe even started to debate about this problem that none of us will agree with, and that's why i think we should have at least a C average to attend any sports or meeting , or being in the student council to be mostly fair about what our average has to be or what grades we make on our report card.
