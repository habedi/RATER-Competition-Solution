Summer Projects

Schools around the world have a long break after the school year ends, around where I live we call these summer breaks, 3 months of kids running around, going to the pool, the beach, and vacation; However, not all of these breaks are the same. Students often get summer assignments or projects. Should these projects be designed by the students or should they be designed by the teachers? I think these projects should be designed by the students because, it would be easier to complete, they would have a better understanding of what they learned throughout the year or what they are still learning, and of course they would obviously have more fun doing it themselves and won't get as frustrated as they would if a teacher designed it, it is summer break after all the student shouldn't stress about anything.

Summer projects should be designed by students because, it would be much faster and easier to finish. All students want to do in the summer is relax and have fun and travel wherever with their family. Students are busy during these breaks regardless their age, so as any student would, they would want to finish their project as soon as possible before they travel or right when they get back before the new school year starts. If students create their own project they will most likely finish it quick and not panic over it last minute. They could make these projects easier for themselves and should have no trouble doing it cause again, it is their project. At the end of my 8th grade year I had to do a summer project where I had to write all about my summer and create a small slide show. The project, was voted by me and other students; Although, there were different things you could write about but we all chose this. This project I had was especially easy for me because, it was created by us students, therefor it took me no time at all and I was able to finish it before the year stated with a week of just free time and no stress or procrastination.

I believe students should make their own projects also because, the students would have a better understanding of the project. Let's be honest teachers make mistakes and may send you home with a project you might end up having a lot of trouble with. If students were to make their own projects it would be a lot less frustrating to finish because we would already have an idea on how to start. By doing this we would still be learning and having fun throughout the break leaving us coming to school feeling like summer wasn't gone so quick and actually wanting to come back to school. I personally, always feel like summer has gone too quick because my summer assignments or projects so far have been boring and extremely time consuming so far because, my teachers make the assignments too hard for me and at the end you get a sense of giving up and not wanting to work on it any longer. Yes it gives you a big fat F in the beginning of the year but no kid likes to waste their time doing something so incredibly annoying during summer break, when they are supposed to have fun.

Students should have a say on what their summer projects should be finally because, we should have fun during the summer and a fun project or assignment is a good way to start off the summer or end the summer. Sure kids can mope around at home and write an essay about what they did throughout the summer or, about some book a teacher assigned over the summer which could become frustrating, or for the summer projects students can assign themselves something fun but also educational over the summer such as challenges to accomplish and gather information they learned from said challenges. Some may argue that teachers should design the projects because kids will be educated better over the summer, but that is wrong; I say this because, most likely the assignment the teacher assigned is harder and more time consuming, again us students are busy during the summer having fun with our loved ones so we most likely do not have time for these assignments, so at least us students can make them fun so we don't have to stress over it. As a student myself I know how hard and time consuming a project is throughout the school year; Therefore, summer shouldn't be treated the same way we should have the right to choose what we want to design as a summer project not the teacher.

In conclusion, In my opinion these projects should be made by the students because, it would be faster to complete, they would know better of what they learned throughout the year or what they are still learning, and they would entertain themselves doing it and won't get as annoyed as they would if a teacher designed it. I a student believe, teachers should really think more of giving kids less of a hard time over their break, and should pay attention more to what the students are doing over the summer and how the project could interrupt their time in paradise. Students of any age shouldn't have pressure over their summer break they should be able to choose what they want to do because it's their days off from school and all they should do is relax, so if a student wants to design their own project I strongly agree they should instead of a teacher doing it. Students are smart enough to create their own projects or assignments over the summer.
