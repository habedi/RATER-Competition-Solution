Summer projects for schools are becoming more popular because schools want their students to continue learning while out of school. Over summer students tend to forget the subjects they have learned. Some schools believe it helps to have summer projects. When students come back from summer break they do not remember the material for some of their classes. This can sometimes be difficult for teachers because they spend all semester teaching it to them. Schools think having summer projects will help with this problem. The summer projects that need to be completed by students should be student-designed because students know the best way they learn, students will gain more knowledge, and student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete.

First of all, students know the best way they learn. Students know if they are better with hands on projects or writing projects. Typically, students are better with hands on projects, but other students enjoy writing projects. I am better with hands on projects. I remember when I was in third grade we had to do a project for our social studies class. My teacher just told me that it had to be on Greece, and she let me design the rest of it. I thought it was easier to design my own projects rather then her telling me how to complete it. Students will figure out how they want to complete the project before they complete it. If a teacher were to design it, the student would have to start it how the teacher wants it.

Furthermore, students will gain more knowledge. Students will actually have to read what they have to do the project on, then they will have to research. When the students research what they have to do the project on they will know what it is about. They would be reading on the subject so much that they would retain the information.

If the project was on the Declaration of Independence the student would have to find out what the Declaration of Independence is. Next, they would have to formulate a plan on how they want to complete the project. They would have to put all of their research into their project. This will help the student to memorize what the Declaration of Independence is. This would help by letting the student get a feel for what the subject is before actually learning it.

Moreover, student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete. They would be easier for students to complete because the student would know what they were doing. If a teacher were to assign something the student did not know how to complete it would be harder for them. The student would not be able to contact the teacher during summer making it more difficult for the student to figure out how to do it if it were teacher-designed. With the summer projects being student-designed the student will know exactly what they are doing. The student would be able to complete it at a faster pace and turn it in at the end of the summer.

In conclusion, the summer projects that need to be completed by students should be student-designed because students know the best way they learn, students will gain more knowledge, and student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete. There are many people who would say that having teacher-designed projects would be easier. Students do not always complete projects if they get a choice of what to do it on. Students are better at doing their projects off of what they design rather than what the teacher does. Being a student myself, I would rather have a summer project that I designed. I would not want to have a summer project that was teacher-designed.
