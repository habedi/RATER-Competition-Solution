Summer projects, the cornerstone of any students journey through the seemingly endless maze that is education. Used as a tool to keep education flowing through the three month stretch of summer, summer projects are useful to many school districts. However, the issue with summer projects is not the work rather than who is going to design the work. Should teachers take time out of their busy day, or should students step up and design a summer project for themselves? Summer projects require care and effort as they are continuing the expansion of knowledge at times when learning is not popular. This is why teachers should design summer projects over the summer, rather than students.

Teachers are the reason why education is even possible, they simply care more about education than an average student. A majority of students will take the opportunity of designing summer work and use it as a pass to create something that will not challenge their minds in order to enjoy time away from schooling. Teachers on the other hand will make the summer project challenging enough to keep knowledge flowing through summertime. Students do not always know what it takes to challenge the minds of thier peer, therefore if students were to make up the summer projects, the quality of the projects will go down. Teachers are more adept to challenging the mind of students.

Designing a summer project is not an easy task. In order to have an effective project, students will have to open their minds and think critically. Teachers already have plenty of experience making work that challenges the brain to think critically, as they have gone through many years of extensive training and education for this exact purpose. Knowledge and wisdom is what sets teachers and students apart, as teachers have more experience in making effective work for students.

An argument that could be used for students to make summer projects is that it would give students a chance to be creative with the work that they are giving themselves. For most students in this day and age, telling them to make their own summer work is like doing dishes after a Thanksgiving day feast. It is seen as tedious and will be met with little care and effort all while the person washing the dishes get to hear everyone else in the other room having a good time watching football. Students will not want to make their own work and will most likely give themselves easy work to get out of the assignment rather than thought provoking, challenging work.

If school systems are looking to enlighten students with knowledge over the summer, having teachers make the summer assignments would be the ideal situation. Teachers are simply more qualified to think of challenging work than students are.Â
