I disagree with this use of technology beacause i think we are relying too much on tech. Today we use so much technology that we are taking a test on a computer that used to be on paper! I worry that if we were to have a nationwide powersurge we'd be sitting ducks. but a couple decades earlier I think we could have been alright. When you are talking with someone you shouldn't rely on tech to tell you how they're feeling, personally I think it's inhumane. I should be able to look at someone and by they're expression (which the computer reads) I myself alone should be able to tell what they are feeling, and if not then you can ask them with your words like a human being would. We aren't robots we don't need to ask siri how are loved ones are feeling. It completely takes away the joys of bonding and in the case of mona lisa, the elegance of mystery. I personally love art and portraits because it's fun to try and figure out what they are thinking and then ask someone else what they think because that person might have a different idea. Using technology would take away peoples idea to different veiw points of the same portrait. I think we should rely on ourselves to figure out what mona lisa is thinking. Personally to me, she looks like a caring guardian kind of woman, maybe a mother or loved one. Going back the text says she was 83% happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, and 2%angry. I say it's 100% up to you. In the case of the students what if the picture is taken when they blink? Or if they sneeze? Jane could be having a really sad day and the picture could be taken at the worng moment and say she was ecstatic. You can rely on tech for these readings you need to read them face to face. Ask them how they are feeling, don't just run up and snap a pic. In conclusion, use your words and ask how someone is feeling!
