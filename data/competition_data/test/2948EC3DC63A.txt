After reading "The challenge of exploreing venus" i belive that it is a very interesting idea. Scientists want to exlpore futherer and learn more about this mysterious planet that in ways is very similar to earth. There are many problems though such as venuses voilet and trechorous weather, many probes they send dont last a few days due to such harsh conditions.

Venus is a very strange planet, it is so similar to earth but also very different. It is belived to have at one point been covered in noting but vast oceans which may have held aquatic life just like the ones on earth. Venus also contains valleys,mountians, canyons all very much like earth.

To send humans to explore venus would be impossible due to the fact there atmoussphere is made up of nothing but charbon monoxide and there is lots of sulfhric acid which would burn humans. The best way of exploration is by probe which can go places humans can not.

In conclusion exploreing venus would be a great scientific discovery and would make history. But are the risks really worth it? thats up to everyone else, our travels into space shouldnt be limited but sometimes they ned to be.
