This year I chose Robotics as my extracurricular activity and so far I have had a lot of fun building and programming the robots. It is also a high school level class and it will count off one of my class credits. Next year I am taking cibersecurity, American sign language, I will be on the football team and I will continue doing boy scouts. (I don't know if that last one actually counts) These extracurricular activities will help me on my path to graduating and help me get a job that I want. I think extracurricular activities are a helpful way to get students involved and I think that we should make every student take at least one activity.

Right off the bat I can say that football will keep you fit and in good health and that is something that I think ever person should be in. In scouts I pick up trash and follow the scout oath to try to be a better citizen in our community. I love both of those and they are very fun to me and I enjoy trying to get better and better at them. It's the off season right now which isn't an excuse but I haven't been doing all the workouts I should to keep the conditioning that I was in but I am still in pretty good condition. As for scouts we do hikes and over this summer we are going west and hiking for one to two weeks so most weekends I hike to make sure I am in shape to hike for days on end. I love exercise and it is a vital part of my life. Thats why I like the sports aspect of extracurricular activities and scouts is just an additive that I enjoy.

At the moment I am only doing robotics as my in school activity this year which is a great way to scratch the surface of coding and learning how to completely assemble a robot. Now if I want to go do something with coding I know the basics and I would understand more of what I was doing. I love building things so the assembly part of robotics is my favorite. I love working with my hands and building something from nothing. As I said I will be taking cibersecurity which I actually know nothing about but I've heard good things about it and so it intrigues me. Before I mentioned that I love working with my hands which is exactly why I want to take ASL because then I am taking a language which is a high school requirement for getting an advanced degree from high school but I will also be able to work with my hands and if I ever need to help some one who is deaf I hopefully will be able to talk to them and figure it out with them.

Now I know what you're thinking, "W

hat if we don't want to take the extracurricular activity!"

Well then to bad! You should at least try something because there are a lot of classes in high school that you can take and there might be one that you find to really enjoy! Besides it's good for you and you need it for your diploma. Now you could argue again and say that, "

I would have more time in my day to do homework and other stuff!"

That is technically true but an hour and thirty minutes wouldn't make that big of a difference! Just use your resource or study hall time wisely

I think extracurricular activities really help and contribute to your learning. From my experience it has and I really have enjoyed taking them. If everyone took just one extracurricular activity then they would know more and have a better chance to spread out and search and find what they really like and want to do. Extracurricular activities should be made mandatory even if it's just one.
