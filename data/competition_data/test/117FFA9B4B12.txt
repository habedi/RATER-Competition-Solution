Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are thinking of changing the grade average policy from C average to B to participate in school activities and sports.

I absolutely love this idea but it could hurt our sport teams and our activities. It could hurt them because at least half of them have a C average which means they wouldn't be able to play and it could effect our school team. Our school events for sports are a big thing I mean a lot of people like to come and watch but if we were not that good because some of our kids were kicked off that would be sort of lame. For example, if our best player and also our biggest player did not have the grades to play he would be kicked off and we would not be that good.

I would like if it stayed as a C average to be on the sports teams because out teams would stay the same and be good. If you did bad on one test and it dropped your grade to a C that means you could not play and that's not fair. I don't think that's fair because everyone does bad on at least one quiz or test. I would be really bummed if I couldn't play a game or two because i did bad on one single test.

If they did change the policy I don't think it would be helpful because our sports would start to go down.

I think that everyone expects to much out of us kids, were just kids. When your a kid I thought you were supposed to have fun, mess around, and do stupid things? All I have to say is please keep it simple at a C average and it will keep everyone happy!

Sincerely,

Your student
