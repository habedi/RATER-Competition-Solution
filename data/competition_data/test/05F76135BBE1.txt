Have you every been told that adults always have to be around for teenagers to do the right things. Some schools believe that the project they give over the summer should be teacher desgined. I disagree with that for the fact that student desgined projects gives the scholars a chance to show they're responible, show that they have creativity, and show that they are willing follow directions.

My first reason is that teens can show their teachers just how responisble they are just by doing a project over the summer. I might sound like an easy task but its now. Students constantly are distracted by the other lives of their friends and family, therefore a Student might have a hard time complete a task such as this. You might think im pointing out the bad but if the student can overcome this challenge he or she will be on the path of becoming an adult; completing goals that you might not want to do but you have to do it. Student will feel more secure with themselves and more ahead in life. I cannot name a time where being responsible has had a negative outcome.

Next I would like to talk about creativity. The problem with the school system is that they try to limit what a student can do with their creativity. They try keeping it contained so the teenagers will not get out of hand. This choice of action made by the school board, I fell that it is selfish and unjust. In 2008 a movie Created by Disney with the name Lemonade Mouth was released in the movie symbolized that students should stand up for what they believe and get created as Antagonist plotted to take everything out of the school that had irrelaventcy to sports. I believe that students should have this chance to create their own creative ideas to finalize the process of figuring out who they are and who the students would like to become.

Finally I will add that letting students craft projects without supervision will shape them in a way such as following the rules that leads to becoming a productive member of society. Understand what one says and carrying it out without asking question is a tool most adults lack. Teens have an advantage to get this teaching at a young age. Everywhere you journey there are rules that you must follow: park here, throw trash away there, pick up your dog's dropping. We must always follow rules even when we don't want to. Students have the oppurtunity to have a trial and error basis now because once you become an adult there is no more playing around.

So in my closing I strongly agree with the schools letting their young adults achieve early success buy giving them a chance to exercise thier Responsiblity, Creativity, and Direction Following.
