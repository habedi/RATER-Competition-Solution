Students learning from home online can be beneficial to students but also, its not. I am not leaning towards either side since it has pros and cons that are both correct. The students are getting the same information they do if they went to school, except it is on a device instead of learning vocally. The students that are learning at home online are still getting enough information since the classes online teach the same thing as schools.

There are going to be challenges when learning online at home. Might run into problems where the website is not working or they might not have very good wi-fi that can run well. Might not even have any service to work online. There are so many bad possibilities when working online at home, but there are also good pros when working at home online.

If they were to work at home, they might put in more effort since they are in an environment that they are comfortable and familiar with since they're at home. At school, some people don't have the urge to work hard or try their best since they aren't as comfortable. Schools are bit to noisey since there are other students there and causing some chaos. That doesn't help the student focus as well and also can get annoying when it is not the right time. At home, you have more room, and can do more when not distracted.

Distraction can be a big problem when taking a class at home. Not many people can focus when even doing homework. Phones, food, pets....etc, can all be big distractions. When having to be taught online, it can get boring and then having the need to get distracted. That is what happens in school. We get bored and get distracted since we are not in the mood to learn. There are some subjects that aren't eye catching and they never make people want to learn what they have to give since it isn't interesting enough.

When learning the information, there might be some difference on how schools might teach and how online might teach. There might be some information that the online learning could leave out. There are different strategies when teachers teach and when learning online. Teachers go more in depth and make students focus more on what is going to be on the test. Online does the same but it might also spread out more information and teach a few things at once.

If you learn online, students might not catch the important stuff or might not understand it as well when reading it to themselves.

Students, when learning at home, can wake up on their own time and not be in a rush to school and not be worried to miss the bus. They might have to do a lot more work when learning at home. Time can be a problem to those who are learning online but also, rime is limted to students in school. The have 8-9 months of school and at the end, they have to take the final test which is everything they learned. I am not sure how it works for those who woerk online but I'm sure they do have to take an exam at the end of their course.
