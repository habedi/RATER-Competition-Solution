I disagree with the principal because students shouldn't be forced to do extracurricular activities. When I go home I watch my younger brother. I don't have time to do after school programs. After school I become tired because I don't sleep. So when I come home I would like sleep. After school programs should be a choice and not required.

My brother has epilepsy. I need to watch him so he doesn't have a seizure or I can help him. If i stay at school and he has a seizure. There is no help for him. My grandmother is getting older and has difficulties walking. If she falls down the stairs how can I help her if I'm at school. I have things to do and so little time.

I often begin the process of sleep at around 10-12. I wake up at 6 am. I 5 to 8 hours of sleep and

I need those hours. If I dont get my required amount of sleep hours. I become a Goblin/Gremlin and live in the dark basement and the light burns. So now you know why I need my sleep. I become less productive and less effective for learning. After my long and painful days at school I sleep. I come home and eat and do homework and then I sleep. The next will be harder than the day before it. So if I stay for extracurricular activity I won't be able to sleep.

The most expensive thing is time. We use it everyday and we have so little time. I have a life and you should too. I have things I must do. I would not to spend it at Animie Club. The precious time would be wasted. Its my choice to pursue education and stay after school. We spend a quarter of our lives at school or learning. I would like to see things and do things. Go places and see things that are new. I think having extracurricular activities are good. Their not good for all us. We have lives too. We may have jobs or sports stuff we need to do. I think extracurricular activities should be a choice.
