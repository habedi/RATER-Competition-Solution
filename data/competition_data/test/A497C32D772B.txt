I have always thought community service was important but i have never taken the time to do it. This is what I think about the principal requiring all students to perform community service.

First I think if I would get involved with community service I would do things that would help the earth; for example: picking up trash, putting recycle bins on the sides of roads so that people could have easy access to putting there paper or plastic in them, or even going by the community ocean, river lake or pond to clean up around the area to make sure that no animals could get harmed by the pollution humans put on our the earth.

Next, children around the world set around and watch television all day when they could be doing things for the community, we should be able to set an example to young people to grow up and help the world so that when they grow up they will be able to not pollute the earth and keep it green. Also we can always plan a day to take out of time to be able to do what we want instead of community center time.

Last, some children involved in school might not want to be involved in community service, but some might. That is why i think that the principle should put that up for a extra curricular activity for children and students to get involved in. All in all i think that having students be required to join and help out with community service would be a very good idea to have the principle or student administrator to have put in to the children's lives. Who say's that community service is just for inmates at jail? Not me! That is why I thank you for giving us the opportunity to be involved in community service!
