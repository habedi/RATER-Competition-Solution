Dear, Principal

To , the principal

I would like to inform [you/tell], you how bad of and idea it is to let cell phones be brought to school to use during lunch . I' am a fellow student here. One reason would be that students will be using them during lunch and would most likely start a conversation , that would most likely go unfinished because of lunch. More than likely any student who does not finish they conversation and knows they have been given privileges will go, and finish there conversation during class.

Also another reason i believe why the idea of allowing cell phones to be used during school is a very bad idea and would make or city, town, district, and state look less academic. I believe we would be us to compare to better districts, and states of the U.S. . Please take into consideration of this, because we do not go to school to fool around. We attend school for academic and career purposes only.

In, conclusion are school is better off the way it is .

Your, fellow student.
