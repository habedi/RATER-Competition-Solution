Yes I think the use of this technolgy would be helpful in the class room on so many diffrent levels. If sombody is sad or is angry you could help them out with there work and also solve the problem to make them happy. If you pu this technology in class rooms you can show if somboy is lying or is telling the truth. Say if you told the teacher that you where thgreatend but really you where not they would more than likely to belive you. So if you had the technolegy in the class room you can show that you where lying so know body would get in unneseary truble over somthing that you said. If you had the technolgde in the class rooms or in the hall ways you can watch out for peolpe who have a anger prolbem you get vthem help or if sombody said that they where going to shoot up the school you could stop harm before the person hurts anybody in the school. That is why i said yes we should have it in the class rooms all acroos the world and there would be less harm done to students and teachers and people would make the world a better place if they are only shown good things then they might not do bads thing to the world. That is why I said yesbut allso you cpould make people worse if they tried so hard to hide it but you keep trying to pull it out of them but it might work.
