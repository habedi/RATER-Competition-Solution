Have you heard of the Seagoing Cowboys? If not, they are a group that was hired by the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). They were hired to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules. I, Luke Bomberger, am a part of the Seagoing Cowboys.

We thinks you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys. Some reasons why we think you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys is that besides taking care of and bringing ruined coutries animals. You can visit and seeing new places such as Europe and China.

Before you can visit those wonderful places, you have to take care of the animals. You have to make sure their stalls were clean, and that they had been fed and watered two or three times a day. You also have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship you are traveling in.

There is also fun to be found on the ship. Once you have unloaded all the animals, you could play baseball or even volleyball in the empty animal holds. To pass the time people would do table-tennis tournaments. They would also do fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling to also pass the time.

A job that you might have to do is night watchman. During the night, the only thing you have to do is that you would have to check on the animals every hour.

These are my reasons why you should join of the Seagoing Cowboys, and what you would have to do if you were a part of the Seagoing Cowboys.
