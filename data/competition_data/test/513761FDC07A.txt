Dear Principal,

Hi, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I attend your school.

I am in the 8th grade.

My opinion on community service is this! I think that community service is a great thing to do for someone even when you don't have to.

It takes putting others before yourself to do this.

I see it as an act of kindness. It shows that you care about other people and it also shows you using unselfishness!

Doing community service gets people to notice what you are doing even if you don't think that anyone notices. I have been in the position where me and a couple friends went to play with some kids at a park while their parent worked all day and the smiles on there faces puts a smile on mine. I never realized what I was doing for those kids by just hanging out with them.

By the end of the day, I didn't want to leave and neither did all the little kids. We had a blast and doing that made me feel good about myself!

I have also done other community service.

One time we went to the high school and made one-million meals for kids in Africa who are starving today.

Seeing everyone in one big room showing kindness and compassion while making those meals with a smile on their faces gave me chills!!

I think community service should continue because doing something for someone else makes you feel good and you never know what good you are doing for that person.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
