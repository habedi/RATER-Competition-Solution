For as long as they could remember, students have been attending school by following a structural path of their personal education. They take classes that teach them basic principles that they will contribute to their every day lives, as well as the future. As the world progresses in advancement, technology has played a vital role in expanding the education system. Some schools now offer an option for students to attend classes from their own home by online or video conferencing. This innovative and modern policy has been heavily debated upon if it is the right move for students to further their educational career. Although some may argue that distance learning may increase laziness for students, having them able to attend classes from home would overall benefit students by creating a comfortable environment, improving learning styles and creativity, as well as preparing them for college and future jobs.

Students spend a majority of their day at school and become aware of their certain surroundings. They understand their school dynamic and environment, which contributes a vital role in their education. If a student is uncomfortable with the environment that is represented throughout the school, it will make them dread coming to school and unmotivated to learn. Students spend around seven hours of their day at school, and if they are in an hostile habitat, it will negatively impact their education. By forcing students to stay in a place where they do not feel comfortable, it will deprive them of the knowledge and experience they could be receiving. Having students work from home would allow them to create their own safe space that they will learn better in. They would be in a comfortable environment that they themselves are used to, and can prosper in. Online classes would benefit students by giving them the choice to leave an environment where they feel limited, for a place that they know would allow them to learn effectively.

Every student is different, and they all know what methods they personally learn best from. Teachers at school often disregard this, and they go on to teach all of their students the same way. They have no choice but to implement this, due of the vast amount of students they have and the deadlines of curriculum. This way of educating limits the potential of students, as they are constricted to one way of learning. By giving students the opportunity to take online courses, they would be able to practice the learning style they know is best fitted for them. This will overall lead to better retention and understanding of the work that is being asked of them. Students know themselves, and they know what works for them in regards to learning certain materials. This freedom of education will also promote creativity and allow them to come up with new ways and projects for themselves. By allowing students to take these online courses, they would be able to learn effectively and broaden their horizons of ideas.

Students go to school to learn ideals that they will one day use in the future for their own well being. Everything that is taught to them is meant to build their knowledge and invent new ways of innovation for themselves, as well as society. By having students attend their classes from home, it will prepare them for the college and work experience that is set out for them. In college, students work on assignments on their own digital devices and submit them to their professors online. This is how they learn and build off of their knowledge, a concept that could be taught at an earlier age through the developments of online classes. In addition, with the speed at which technology is developing, most jobs will ask their employees to have technological knowledge and skills. This will put students at a greater chance of obtaining these jobs with the online experience they have. By having students take up on distance learning, they will become better equipped for the future that is ahead of them.

Many may argue that online classes will make students more lazy and likely to procrastinate their work. Though in hindsight, these online courses will further teach students how to schedule their time and effort on their assigned projects. These students know what will happen if they procrastinate their assignments, and through this they are better prepared to finish their work with the resources available to them. Online classes will even give students the opportunity to get ahead of their work, since they are not following the same schedule the courses taught at the school go.

A student's education is very important, and it is emphasized on being a fundamental building block of their own life. By implementing the choice of online classes, students would be able to take themselves out of hostile environment for somewhere they know they could learn in. They would be able to explore different learning styles that they know are best suited for them, which goes to spark creativity in the work they put out. Online courses would also give students the opportunity to jump start on their future and build habits that will benefit them for college and the work force. By having schools offer distance learning, their students would be able to prosper in ways that will benefit them for the rest of their educational career.
