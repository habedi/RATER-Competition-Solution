Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think you should use policy 1. The reason i say that is, i think students should be free to use there cell phones freely in school. Right now students are not really supposed to have cellular device, communication devices etc ... anyways.

Here are some reasons why i say students should be able to use there cell phones in school. Cell phones are just like computers they do anything and every thing you want it to do. Students may have any emergency in school and there can be no phones in that school, for instincts what if an armed robber comes to the school looking for money and to kill. In that case people lives are at risk and just 1 student with a cell phone can be a good thing for once. I believe in the part when student can not use them in class because class is a place for learning not socializing with people through text messages. At most schools at lease 85% of student have a cell phone in their pocket,locker,or backpack. At my school it is like phones are illegal here. SCHOOL_NAME prek-8th grade school is right now going by policy 2 i think this is very wrong. These are the reason i think you should use policy 1.
