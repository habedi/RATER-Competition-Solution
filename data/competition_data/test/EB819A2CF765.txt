My principal has given me the opportunity to chose an extra activity that I would like to do, and that activity is basketball because I get to meet new people, stay on my daily exercise, and have fun

I was claimed to be the best at basketball player at my old school from all of my friends, teachers, and coaches at my school. But now that I'm at a new school I have to prove to my new friends, teachers, and coaches that I can strive to be the best at basketball.

Basketball tends helps you meet new people because you play with a team. When you play with a team you normally meet new people that are good at the game, but they could be better then you, stronger than you, faster than than you, or it could be the opposite. For example, I met one of my best friends Generic_Name playing basketball at my old school and we still are friends till this day. Now I figured you will tend to find friends while playing basketball when you ask to join a pick up game. When you join a pick up game there are normally people with the same skill if not better than you. Another example would be,one time I joined this pick up game and met this kid named Generic_Name. He was really good at the game and showed me a few pointer like keep your foot lined up to the rim and when you dribble get down low so you have more control of the ball, stuff like that.

Basketball is a good way to keep your daily exercise going because when you run it gets your heart rate up, you burn fat, and you add to your endurance. Now when your running down the floor, 40% of your energy being used and 60% of heat is being added to you. When your using your arms to dribble the ball, you are using your main muscles in your arms to go back and forth between both sides, we call them repetitions. For example when your working out at the gym you do bicep curls, Its just like that just with a basketball. But just remember the more your work on keeping your exercise up for basketball the better you will get. You will start running faster witch helps you get back on defense and fast breaks on offense. The reason why people still use basketball to exercise is because its something they love to.

The real reason why basketball is fun is because you get to hang out with your friends. Basketball wouldnt be nearly as fun if it werent for your friends. You get to play pick up games, horse, and challenge other friend groups to test your skill. There are different types of fun for different players, like shooting hoops by your self, shooting around with your friends and playing pick up games, they are all examples of what fun could be like for basketball players. You could play a ton defense and working on blocking and stealing, or you could be a point guard or someone on the wing that likes shooting mid range shots that could be your fun. There are many different types of fun in the game of basketball you just have to find your type of fun.

Basketball isnt just a sport, its a lifestyle. You work out, have fun, and meet new people, you just have to be willing to take the risk to make it your hobby. If your cant be willing to put your everything in to this then there in not point in even. Its just going to always be in the back of your mind saying, "why didnt I stick to what I love." Luckily I am one of the lucky people that will never stop trying for what I love.
