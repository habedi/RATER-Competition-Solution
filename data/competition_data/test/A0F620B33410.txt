Limitation to car usage has had great benefits. People will have better safety, and people are happier and less tense without the usage of a car. Life with no cars are spreading to places such as, Germany, and Bogota. People will tell you how great their lifes have been without the usage of a car.

"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Said Heidrun Walter mother of 2, who lives in the Vauban's community. The Vauban community in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe. Bogota, Colombia have limited their car usage as well. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free-day they have in Bogota. "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode his bike to work. They've even had people come to watch the event. Like the mayor of Paraguay who said, "These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."

"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shif," said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Dexel University. Now a days people don't need to drive somewhere to go meet people. They just use the internet, and the use of cell phones have increased in communicating with people. With these changes, people who have stopped car commuting in the United States, may find less reason to resume the habit. But in places such as New York, with new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tools reflect these new priorities. "Pedestrian, bicyle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmissions and improve safety."

In conclusion, life with no cars would be beneficial. You'll be provided with better safety, and wont be as tense and alot happier than you were before. You'll be able to see what life is really all about. A better life.
