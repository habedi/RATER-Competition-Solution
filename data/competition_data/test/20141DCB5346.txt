I believe school summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects will help a student express their creativity, it will be less complicated, and it will let them learn about a topic they are interested in. If the project is student-designed, it is most likely for them to keep up with it and not set it aside. Students should be trusted to build something on what they learned on their own.

Even though not all students come up with astonishing ideas, all of them have the capacity to be creative. Creativity is important when it comes to projects. It helps a project look presentable, it also helps the audience gain interest. Students can let their imagination discover more ideas when a project is not teacher-designed because their options are not limited. Not only will it be more exciting to do a project, but it will increase students' grade by showing their creativity.

A student-designed project will relieve stress from students by being able to create whatever they please. Instead of having to assemble something difficult given by a teacher, a student will choose an easier option for themselves, so they will not build up pressure. Since they will most likely pick a non difficult idea, they can complete their project faster. Therefore, students will enjoy their summer break more.

Furthermore, most students will choose an option they are intrigued in, which makes a project become more interesting. Students will pick one out of a variety that they enjoy; they will stay on task. For example, the more engaged the students are to their project the more it will help them stay focused. When they pick a topic they like, the project becomes more simple to make because it is genuine or sincere.

Given all these points, summer projects should be designed by students. It will make it more easier for the students to work on and more interesting for the teacher to read. All of the students' creativity and engagement in the project can lead to positive outcomes. Students should enjoy their summer break while creating an incredible project they love. Teachers should not doubt students when they design their own projects.
