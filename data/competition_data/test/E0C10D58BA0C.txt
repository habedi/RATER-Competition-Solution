I'm Luke and I am in the Seagoing Cowboys. Many people wouldn't join in on this,but I like it you can see things you never saw before. I got into this before I turned 18 years old and the best part was they didn't draft me. Now I'm not saying that this is the best job to do. There are some bad things that are with this job. There are some good things with this job too.

One of the good things are you get to go on these amazing adventures when your doing your job. We got to go around the world and see wonderful new things. We went to Greece and boarded the SS Charles and WW Wooster. It was more than just an adventure the whole world opened up to me, I'm grateful for this opportunity.

Lastly, I had time for fun on board, especially on return trips after animals had been unloaded. We would all have fun while playing baseball, volleyball games,table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittiling, and games that would help pass time. So, it wasn't that bad we had fun while working. We got to see new things. I believe that you you need and will change your mind being a Seagoing Cowboy. Are you convinced?
