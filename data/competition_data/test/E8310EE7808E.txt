Dear Principal,

While i can tell what you are saying, I think that to have a B average to participate in sports is very unreasonable. As you may know an B in a very nice grade to achieve and maintain, but also it may be that most of the student body that participates in sport related activity's cannot achieve such goals. It may be just out of their reach or along ways away, but no matter, they should have the right to play sports just as they have the right to pass with a D average.

Most student who may be having troubles with there school work may not understand or be able to comprehend the material given to them. This is not completely their fault. The teachers should give a better explanation of the material to the students who are troubled.

Don't you think that the students with a C average are already stressed out enough? With all of the extra work they would have to do just to get the B that they need to participate in sports, they would most likely have the sleep they need deprived from them as they would need more time after the strenuous amount of homework given to study for up coming test and quiz's that they need to ace.

So I hope that you consider what I have said, as to prevent all the depravity in the already stressed out teen life.

Sincerely ,
