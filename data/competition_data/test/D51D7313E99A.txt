This is an argument against the driverless cars. They said they are not driverless since you need to drive it when there is too much trafic, in a driveway, out of a driveway, parking, contruction, or if it has a problem with the road ahead. For instince if the car gets in an accedent what would it do since it is controlled by a computer if the computer gets damaged it could go heywire and demolish a building or murder pedestrians or injure pedestrians or it could even make it so you can't controll the car anymore and the computer is just controling the car what happens then who would be in charge of stoping it. That is why i think this is a bad idea my kids could be going on a walk and the computer car could not detect them and run them over or the map on the computer system could say there is a road were it is and it just be a house and if it has to go on that road wich is really a house then it could kill multiple people in that house
