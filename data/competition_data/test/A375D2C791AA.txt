During the story the author explains why it is dnagerous to try and explore Venus. The author tells us that Venus it like our twin sister (Earth) by saying the we are almost simliar in nearly everthing, like density and size and that we are closer in distance to this planet. Then the author names our planetary neighbors, (Earth,Venus, and Mars) and how they orbit the sun diferently. The differences mean the we could closer to Mars one day and closer to Venus the next day. There are many dangers on Venus including that their thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers the planet of Venus. Also the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in their atmosphere. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and o top of all that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what happens on planet Earth. The conditions on Venus are to extreme for humans to enconter. Venus is so dangerous that a submarine could be crushed in minutes. Even though Venus is not the closest planet to the Sun it is extremely hot and it even has the hottest temperatures on a planet then any other planet in our solar system. On Venus it could have erupting volcanos,powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning strikes. We have tried to land a non human space shuttle on Venus but it tends to be damage or destoryed before even landing on the planet thats why Venus is really dangerous.
