A famous basketball player once said "I never wanted to do sports. Until i tried something new." I agree all students should have to participate in a type of school activity. It would help kid arent outgoing make friends,it gives kid something to put on there collage applications,shows them a good time,and give them something to talk about.

First of all,students that would be considered shy might need a push to make friends. Maybe putting them in a uncomfortable situation would open their minds into something they would not have expected. Maybe your a 'new kid' in town and really dont have friends but, you really like Volleyball or Basketball and the school requires you to play you now have people who likes the same things as you.

furthermore, it gives them something to write on collage applications .collage people love reading about you when you played volleyball or seeing that you were sons school council. you could use that as your collage easy. and if you do a sport is would act as a scholarship if you play you cold go to collage and not have to pay money and things of that nature.

Another key factor, it gives you something to talk about. maybe your not a great conversation starter and you need help. and is great conversation to have with people how dont know what b they want to do and you have something to talk with your teammates about like "that was a great game "

Another reason it it gives you a great experiences meaning learn and in general they get a good out looking on different things. For example the learn That they do not like basketball and soccer you still have these skills that you learned while your figuring out you dont like that activity..another example if you some a a famous writer your books can be based off of many different things you activities you did as a child.

In conclusion as a student i believe that you should participate in a school activity. It would help kid arent outgoing make friends,it gives kid something to put on there collage applications,shows them a good time,and give them something to talk about. if you dont play sports now in the future you will regret it .
