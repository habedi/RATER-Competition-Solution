The Facial Action Coding Sytem is not valuable in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students.

In the beginning of the the introduction say, "New sofware has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others." I say this because techology can make mistskes such as a computer that can read your emotions through your face and can have an accurate result. For example you might think an person who is happy by showing a smile but is the person really happy behind that smile with hidden emotions. It's not only one person there are others too who hide their emotions.

In paragraph 5 says, "For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actuallly describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convry specific emotions." I can somewhat agree because he is right about the fact that it's hard describing a facial expreesion that includes surprised or sad.

This shows that we dont need this type technology to show other people how we feel if they accurate.
