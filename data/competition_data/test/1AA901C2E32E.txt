Has any school ever forced you to do a sport or a school activity like student council or the year book. Because they have to me and I disagree with it. Because some people are just not meant for sports and other activities and it might be hard on some parents cause not every body has time and money.

The first thing most people come in to trouble with when trying to do a school activities or sports is the money and time not every body is a work from home or a stay at home parent/guardian some people even work from 6am to 9pm and cant pick up there kids. The next problem is not every one has money to afford sports and they can get really expensive depending on which sport that you want to play.

Another problem is some kids do not like to be social and have anxiety which can help them but it might also really mess with them. Certain students that don't always like to talk which is something you always need for team work and extracurricular activities like student counseling. The fourth problem is that some people are not always in the best shape to play a sport and people might make fun of them for when they play or do anything. The final thing is some people have medical problems like asthma where they can not run for long periods of time which you need in a sport.

In the end i really disagree that everybody should have to do sports or certain activities because not every one has time, money, and sometimes the right mental health or just dont like to communicate with people which is something that everyone needs for teamwork.
