I think that students should only have to have a C average to play sports. I think that because as long as students are passing and not failing they should be able to play any kinds of sports. Also there are lots of other things that students have to do that don't involve school. For example a student might not have as much time to study if they are in a sport at there school. They have to go to practice which can be from an hour to two hours.

If they have a game they have to play in that night. Plus any other things they have to do at home like chores or watching there brother or sister. While if they didn't have all that to do they could focus a little more on there school work.

Another reason is that a C average is passing and not failing. There is no reason to make students have a B average to play in sports. It is already hard enough to pass all seven of our classes with a C average. I think that if you have a C average you work pretty hard to get that. Most students who have an A or a B average aren't in any sports ,or they don't have much to do at home like chores or baby sitting.

Another reason is that if you changed that policy most students wouldn't have the grades to play. If they do manage to get there grades up there would be a lot more stress in there life. If the students in athletics have stress then they might not play as good as they would if they didn't have any. If the team isn't any good that will just make there motivation in themselves go down which can make them feel even worser.

With all of that combined it would be really hard for someone to play in sports. That is why I think students in athletics should only have to have a C average to be in any type of sports. Like I said earlier I think that students should only have to have a C average.
