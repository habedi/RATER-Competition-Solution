I beleive that we should just stay with the voting we have. Because many people are used to that way of voting. I trully think we need to just stay the way we areif we do the other way of voting people will just stop voting all togethar. and all the hard work of the electors will be for nothing.

If you were in charge of the voting procces would you changa it? If I was I wouldint do a thing. to many people just would hate the goverment for what they have done if they change it. My parents for one thing are some of those people.

if we were to change the way we vote. Many people would be lost because the government would just wont explain the new voting way. Just how many people do you think would agree with me? too many people wont be able to feel like there voting if this new way of voting is passed.

Just how would you feel if you had to do something you do every day differantlly this year? I would feel so weird if I did something differant. Every doesnt like change that much. I would hate anyone that would change something i do every year.
