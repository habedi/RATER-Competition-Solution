Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with your statement that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average. My opinion is that it is unfair to most students.

I disagree with your statement because most students have a grade C average. Now if the grade B average policy becomes official, A LOT of students will not being playing school sports due to the fact that most of the students have a grade C average! And it would most definitely not be fair to students who love sports, would it? Would you really like to take away the joy from the students who love to play school sports?

Another reason I disagree with your statement is because a lot of the students at our school work hard. If you pass the policy, people will still have work hard, but not get to do what they love. All together, it would be completely unfair to deter the grade C average policy.

In all respects, it would be highly appreciated if you thought a bit more about your grade B average policy. I believe you will do what is right by not passing the grade B average policy.

Sincerely,

SCHOOL_NAME Student Body.
