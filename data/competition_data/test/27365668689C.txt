Driving and Phones

Phones and driving have been a big problem and continue to be a big problem. Just one careless person looking down to read a text could result in multiple deaths. People don't fully grasp the reality of the danger that is really there, people think that oh it would never happen to them or that they're too good a driver for them to hit someone. But just looking down at your phone could end things for you and others.

Could be someone walking, another car, a child, an animal, anything. When you take your yes off the road then it distracts you from your surroundings, from where you're going, from whats infront of you.

There are already laws in place to try and stop people from being on their phones while behind the wheel, but some people just don't care and some people think that they could just never hit someone or something. Cell phones should not be a priority while driving, you are trying to get from point A to point B. You should be able to wait till you are out of the car to answer a text or check social media. If it is urgent then simply pull over as soon as you can and get to it. But you should never be on your phone behind the wheel.

There has been many deaths related to cell phones and driving and with people becoming more and more addicted and attached to their phones and social media its harder and harder to get people off their phones. People are so attached that they are on their phones all the time not caring where they are.

I believe we should have harsher punishments and better ways to detect people on their phone. Maybe a harsher punishment for just being seen holding it behind the wheel will make some people think twice.
