In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author describes the harsh reality of the planet Venus by explaining the enviorment and atmosphere of the planet. However, he then uses facts, past experiments, examples and the possible solutions, to the issues presented, to explain why exploring Venus is beneficial.

In the beginning of this writing, the author discusses the relations between Earth and Venus by stating, "Often reffered to as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." The author then mentions important issues of Venus' harmful enviorment: 97% is carbon dioxide, the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid, it can reach up to 800 degrees, the pressure is 90 times greater than Earths, erupting volcanoes, poweverful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes.

Even though these issues are very important, the author explains why scientists are very interested in Venus by stating , "Astonomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered laregly with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." The author then discusses how Venus has mountains, valleys and craters just like Earth. By giving examples how it was so similar to Earth, and certain features that are still similar, it shows why scientist are interested. By the author using facts and examples from the past, the author backs up their claim of why exploring Venus is a benifit.

Near the end of the authors writing, they discuss how scientist are trying to work with the major issues of exploring Venus. The writing says, "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist float above the fray." Even though the author says the tempature would be 170 degrees, the air pressure would be similar to sea levels on Earth which is survivable for humans. By the author showing that it is possible for human survival, they show another benfit of exploring.

By the author claiming that studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents, they sucessfully explain why they feel this way. The author uses facts, past experiments, examples and possible solutions for the presented issues on Venus to show why exporloring it, would indeed, be beneficial.
