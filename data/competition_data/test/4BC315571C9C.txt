Phones and Driving

Should a person text and drive?

Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. I don't think you should always do it or always have to the need to use your phone while thing is happening around you. Imaging going 65 mph and your jus on the phone playing candy crush. What the chances of something wrong happening. A LOT

Driving is dangerous for those who don't really know a lot About it. You have to be sharp on the look about. What if a kid runs out to get his ball and you don't pay attention because you were on the phone? That would be devastating for your and the kid's family, having to act like you really wasn't on the phone lying that you didn't see him. All because they were on to phone and couldn't wait till, they were at a full stop to check it.

I think that's the only time you can check your phone, and I'm not talking about checking your whole social media accounts. I mean just making sure no one texted you or missed an important call. If you do pull in anywhere and check, if its that important you wouldn't put anyone else's life in danger. Its all safe or not safe at all and I don't care how long you've been driving anything can't happen to anyone. You can't de greedy and pick yourselves over a kid or young person who might have had something great happening.

Its never okay to check your phone while moving your vehicle. A lot of people lose their life's and others because there being irresponsible and just can't leave there phone alone. I hate driving and seeing someone texting like put it down before you run into me. Also, there are so many injury's and deaths because of it. There are almost 390,000 injury's each year and one out of fours car accidents are based on texting and driving.

Should a person text and drive? Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. those are the reasons why I wouldn't want no one texting and driving its dangerous, and immature. I think everyone should just listen to the rules. Especially if you think about it, a law that could save your life or anyone else on the road. I think people shouldn't text and drive.
