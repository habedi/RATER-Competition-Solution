Policy One

I believe that students are responsible of having phones in school, but remembering to use them at the appropriate time. I feel students should actually get a chance to take on that challenge instead of letting them choose for us. We as students know that it is a reason that we shouldn't have, but teachers need to recognize to that we do need them in school for certain purposes. For example, I ride the bus home at least three times a week. Sometimes I need to call my mother to ask her questions about the transportation problem. I do realize that we do have school phone that I can use for that situation, however the system is not quick enough when you can just get it done right there.

My problem about this rule is why doesn't the rule involve everyone such as teacher, superintendents, and advisors. Why do they text and talk to people on their phone, taking personal calls when they shouldn't be allowed that. They don't have consequences for that action, but students like me do. We get it taken away and if they see it again, possibility that you wont get it until the end of that school year. Us as students know that we can get consequences for cell phones, we also know how to prevent from letting the cell phone actually for being seen. I'm not saying if they allow students to use cell phones on school hours at specific times they would use them in the right ways they need to be used. Basically we need a chance of proving ourselves wrong or could we actually be right. Policy One clearly states to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time and I think students are mature enough to handle this policy very well.
