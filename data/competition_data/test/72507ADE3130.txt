I against to use technology to reed faces because some times our expressions do not mean that a computer now how we fell.

This told us how this program is created, when a computer create a 3-D, computer model of the face: all the 44 muscles in the model moust move like a human muscles.

So this tell us that the compuner do not now how exactly how we feels in that moment because, the program only recognyse the muscles of the face. So this is a not a good option to used in a clasroom because if you fells happy, or sad, the teacher can ask you if yor are mad because acording with the computer you are.

Or your friends see the program that says you are happy, but yourself is sad, your friend will be start to joke with you and, you do not liked, maybe they will be have problems.

Is not possible that a computer can tell us how we fell.
