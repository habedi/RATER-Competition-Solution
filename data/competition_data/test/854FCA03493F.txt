Mona Lisa is making beautiful smile's to the people and to the world out there. Technology, however, was too advanced after a few years Mona Lisa died. The difference between Mona and the technology is no compliment because Mona is no exception in technology, she was born with no technology back then, as for us, we did!

But Mona Lisa should of experienced technology because technology is fun and you can chat with others! As back then, you couldnt chat with your friends or with your parents, I wondered how children got hold of their parents back then since there wasn't no technology back then.

Exception of Mona Lisa, I feel bad there wasnt no technology back then but at the same time i didn't feel bad because she was probably glad of not having technology. To clarify any information of the technology Mona was glad to have not experienced technology. As others(like our ancestors)they wished to had experienced technology as we are today.

Technology is a tool we now call "daily rountine" because we use it everyday and its a rountine at school. I would have loved to experienced what life would be without technology. But unfortunely, I didnt, I live in a generation of having technology that I now call my rountine becuase i do it at school and at home. Last year, the new iPhone X(10) was made and holy cow how the technology went from iPhone 3 to iPhone 10 in just 5 years(i think it was 5 years).

The iPhone X(10) has cool features that nobody thought of buying it. One of the features are Facial recognition. what i mean by that is, the iPhone X(10)recognizes your face changed your not it still recognizes it.

Another one is that there is now a wireless charger which is insane even though you have to buy the charger to connect it but u dont have to use the word "plug" anymore, instead you say is "I'm going wireless today." The last one I'm going to mention is it doesnt have a home button anymore. Instead, you swipe up or down(i dont know how it goes since i dont have an iPhone X(10))to go to the main page of your screen.
