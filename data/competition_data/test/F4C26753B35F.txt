I think the 1st policy is better because kids should be able to have their cell phones because they want have to hide it anymore and, it can save teacher more class time instead of stopping then taking a phone that's like five minutes of learning the teacher just wasted. I like policy number one because we can deal with taking our phones out at free time. We also want to learn so we would turn the phones off. The teachers wouldn't have to worry about us talking as much because we would be able to text each other. We can study from our phones too that's another good reason why policy number one is the best. Another good reason we should have policy 1 because we might have to call someone if it's a emergency. Policy two is not the best because as i said earlier if a student gets caught with the phone during class time that stopping the whole learning process. Another reason why policy two is bad because what if someone had to call for a ride home and they didn't have their phone because the school wouldn't aloud that. So they decide to walk home and gets kidnapped. All of that could've been prevented if the school would've just aloud kids to have phones. The kids would be very thankful if we could just have our phones.
