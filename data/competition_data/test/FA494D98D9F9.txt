I go with using technology to read emotion expressions of students because I find it smart if the teacher or principal wants to know how people feel in a certain classroom or even to test the emotions of teens during a time of stressful events like a big test or Final Exam.

I only support using technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom because It would be a good way to evauluate how students and teachers feel during situations in school classrooms. I believe that I should only be allowed if the student that is being tested approves of it because besides experiments or testing for big tests its none of the schools business. In a middle of a test a evaluator could put a computer near the student testing and get a 3-D model of the face and see all of the 44 major muscles in the face (according to paragraph 3) and see how you feel, during the test you can figure out with the technology if the student that is testing is happy, worried or confused during it all. THe FACS can even help when a teacher is doing a lecture to see how students in a classroom feel about the teachers teaching like if they are bored or confused about what is going on, as it says in paragraph 6 of "Making Mona Lisa Smile."

I am all for the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of a student if the student agree's to be a example or test for the Facial Action Coding System. It's a good idea for a classroom atmosphere for testing.
