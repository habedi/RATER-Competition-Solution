Dear Principle,

I agree that students should have at least a B grade to participate in school sports and activities.

Many schools across the country have many talented athletes, but going to school is to help there education get stronger. So in my opinion, education first, then sports and activities.

First off, school is a place where children and young adults can learn and get educated. Most students average, but there's always the ones that may slack off, or not care. I think it is a reasonable policy for kids to have at least a B grade level to participate in school sports and activities.

Having this policy can very must so motivate students to do better in school and try harder. Its also a good lesson to have kids have to reach for what they want. You cant always get what you want, but everyone has to work for something. So, as a student, I agree that having a policy for playing sports and other activities with a B grade level is a good idea. A grade B level is above average, and having that letter grade as the lowest grade is a good idea because then some kids can be so motivated and work hard enough to get an A! Or maybe for some students getting a B is a very good grade, either way this policy can motivate kids to reach for goals to do what they want.

This policy may also keep kids responsible, if they know that they have a soccer game or basketball game coming up they have to be responsible enough to keep their grade level as is or get it up so they can participate. This policy will help kids become or stay responsible with working for what they want or remembering homework, tests, quizzes, etc. anything that is going on in a child's education should be the first thing they should worry about.

This policy is a good lesson for working hard to get what you want. It can teach kids so that later in their future they can understand that you cant always get what you want, that there is always something to work for to get it. It will also help kids make goals for themselves so that they can understand the consequences for not allowing themselves to do the best they could have done.

So, as a student I agree to this policy because its a motivation to do good in school, it help kids stay responsible, and it teaches a good lesson on working hard to get what you want. So again, I very much so agree to this policy.
