I disagree with the school offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. Because i believe that student would not be learn anything, and they will be not focusing on there class. Parents would distract them or if they have a younger brother they might go and play with him. Taking a online class you spent most of you time inside not outside, and that affects you health. Many students would not have any friend to pay with, because they will be not going into a school. Also, they won't be able to do activities, and they won't experience any new thing everyday. Students can learn something else by going to school.

First, A student taking a online class at home that might be difficult, because there would be a lot on noses for the student, and that will make him lose focus. Parent would ask the student to do favors for them if they are home taking online class. If a student has sibling that will not help the student to work on their class instead they might just go to play with his siblings. The student might have a hard time hearing the teacher or listing to the teacher, because their connection might not be that great. It's hard for a teacher to explain something online or video conferencing.

Second, students won't be able to do activities outside and they won't be having any fun with friends as well, because they will be taking classes at their houses. They are not going to be social with anyone except their teacher, and their health might become not so wonderful, because they will be spending most of their time in inside a house. Student will not reach their limits if they are learning at their house. If the student is talking to the teacher the teacher might not be able to understand the student and that will be horrible for both of them.

Third, the student can become unhealthy, because he or she will be inside most of the time studying. Also, the student will learn how to get on time at school or drive safe because ho or she will be going to a school with other kids. If the student goes in a school she or he will learn how to respect some else, and the student will learn more, like leaning about boundaries at school. If a student goes in to a school he or she might get in to a relationship and that will be good for the student rather then the student just staying home.

Student can improve his or hers skills by going to a school. Such's being more social, playful, and friend full.

Finally, By not going to a school you become more isolated and you dont't spend more time with friends. Sometime you don't understand your teacher or you can't learn by your self, because you can't hear the teacher or the teacher can't heir you. That's why you need to go to a school where you can learn with other students. Their are a fewer benefit from attending classes at home, and there are greater benefit when you go to school. When you go to school you have a lot of fan also you can talk with a teacher in person and show him your work or show something that you din't understand.

Overall their are more opportunities when you go to a school, you learn new things not like when you stay home taking a class. You spent more time with friends and the teacher can be more passion it with you. Learning online can heart your well being. And more people would rather go to school then taking a online class. It's more teachable if a student goes to a school. Students gain better abilities when they go to school.
