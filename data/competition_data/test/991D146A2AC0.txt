When students get sick, coming to school is never their first choice. In some cases, people can contract a sickness and become contaigous without feeling completely under the weather, and they may have enough energy to sit face to face with a teacher and learn. Lives can be unpredictable, so when a student misses a class, it may not be at the most ideal time. Students would benefit from the option of distance learning because it would be a good option for when they get sick and can't come to school, if they had some sort of injury or surgery that prevents them from coming to school for a period of time, or if they have a conflict with sports (such as traveling to a tournament intereferes with their classes) so that they can still hear the information being taught and see the activity occuring in class without actually being present in class.

Distance learning would be a great option for a student who tends to get sick often. With this option, the student can access the materials and information being provided in class without being there in person. In some circumstances, illness can make people extremly tired, or they may feel just fine and be bouncing off the walls with energy and they may need to expell some of it and put it towards school instead. With distance learning being provided, the student has access to resources that they normally wouldn't, while also getting to communicate with their teachers from the comfort of their own home. Also, many students could possibly feel stressed that they are missing assignments in their classes from having sick days, so this form of learning will help to allieviate the stress so that they can fully recover.

As well as the sickness, imapctful injuries and surgeries may happen during the school year, forcing the student to adapt to those circumstances. With the helpful tool of distance learning, students can be productive while stuck in bed resting up. Similarly to having illness, injuries can get to the point of being so severe that students may need to stay in bed and rest themselves. One contradicting example would be a student with a concussion, since some students may end up returning to school soon after it occurs. One may experience pain different from another, so if expectations are set differently by different students, teachers may get upset if a student doesn't utilize the distance learning feature.

And lastly, the distance learning resource would be extremely helpful to the student athletes who have to miss school due to a tournament or traveling to a tournamnet. As an athlete speaking from experience of having to make up a lot of schoolwork due to missing classes because of traveling, this option of distance learning would be greatly appreciated, as during many long carrides, I usually finish my homework in a matter of a few short hours, and play on my phone for the rest. Normally, I would have to go into school early or waste my studyhall making up work that I had missed. Now with the distance learning and option of video conferencing, my teachers can see why I am unable to be in school so that they wont potentially get mad that I am not present in class.

This option of distance learning would be an absolute game changer for students who tend to get sick, injured, have to get surgeries, play travel sports, or are involved in anything else that applies to missing school for an activity. Many students would benefit from being able to take their classes from the comfort of their bed, and would appreciate having this as an option. Many parents would be delighted to know about this feature and learn that the schools do, in fact, care about the well being of their children. Not only will the students benefit from being able to utilize this feature, but the school system will be praised for allowing this to become and option. With distance learning, the students will feel valued and respected that the school has given them another option to recieve their learning, and it will be greatly appreciated.
