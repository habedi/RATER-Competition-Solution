I agree with that decision because i think it would make the school better. And also,I think it will help the students communicate better and make more bonds with other students. Maybe some students dont have anything to do after school or some of them just feel like they don't fit in so they dont do anything school wise, So the Principal making that decision is a good idea to me.

At my school a lot of dumb stuff happens so i feel like if most of the students were to do different activities with each other and help each other out it would help us as a school. If i was to choose a activity i would help make the year book it sounds fun to make! i would enjoy that activity a lot.

However, I do not think all the activity (except sports) should be everyday. Some students may not be able to show up, The Principal should make some of the activites only on Mondays Wednesday, and Fridays. It is also good idea to because Ur doing more than one activity and all of them are different.
