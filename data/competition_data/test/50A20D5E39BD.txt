Some schools require student to complete a project over their summer break to make sure they keep on learning. Should the projects be designed by the teacher or the students?. They should be teacher designed, It would make it more of a challenge to the students. Teachers just make things a little more challenging.

It would be more of a challenge is first reason. If teachers decides on what a student has on he's or her project,it's most likely that it will be more of a challenge. Teachers can choose a subject the students know nothing about. That opens the students mind to learning something new. They will work harder, put more mind into it, and most importantly they are learning.

If the students designed the project it would be too easy. Clearly students enjoy the breaks because they are out of school and hoping for no work. That's coming from a student like myself. If a student decided what he's or her project on it would be on a easy subject. Not only because we wanna have it easy, but also because we wanna rush it. Students wouldn't really learn anything if the project is on something they already know about. Also wouldn't be recieving very little to no new information, so are they really learning that way.

Although other people may disagree, they can say it takes away from students creativity on the project. Students that have their project picked by the teacher may also have a possibilty of not doing it. They may not like the topic so they decide to go with their break and forget about the project. It's also a break for a reason they want time of from school; finally not in class learning. Students may also have their own intrest that may make him work really hard on a project.

But in conclusion should the project be teacher or student designed?. It should be teacher designed, students just benefit more off it. They get their work done then they can decicide what to do with the rest of their summer. They will have the proper break that they been waiting for. But in conclusion there just more benefits in teacher-designed projects.
