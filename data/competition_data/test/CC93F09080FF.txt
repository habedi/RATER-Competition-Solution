There are many ways of gaining an education, but a more modern way of learning is through online schooling. In this era of time, technology has advanced to a point where one can do many things with the use of a device. In this case, obtaining an education is now possible through a glowing screen. Students who choose to take online classes now have a choice of learning on their own via the internet or by taking part in video conferencing with professors/ an educational aid. Of course there are pros and cons to this system, but it all depends on the type of person that the student is, the situation that they may be in, and the type of education that they are aiming to pursue.

The type of person that someone is reflects the way that they work. For example, if a student is known to be lazy, unmotivated, and distracted, then online classes probably aren't the best option to choose because: if they're lazy, then being at home is one of the worst places to do work because it's one of the best places to be comfortable, and as a child when one is comfy, they tend to sleep and dismiss their lessons; if they're unmotivated, there's a low chance that being at home will give that student motivation to do any work simply because of their enviornment; and if they easily get distracted, being at home will give them a higher opportunity to find something to take their mind off of their schoolwork, thus incompletion. Given these characteristics and examples, it is most likely that this student will find interest in anything but their education. On the other hand, if a student is described to be concentrated, consistant, and determined, there's a higher probabilty that they will excel in completing their online work because of the type of mindset that they have. But if a student is half and half, it is advised that they physically go to school just to reduce the possibilty of inconsistancy when at home. The way that a student is or acts determines the type of education that suits them best.

Another factor to whether or not a student could benefit through online education are the types of situations that a student may be going through. Put into context, if a student is going through personal issues and would rather be isolated than to be around a crowd of people, then online schooling might be the better option for them. They would have their closure and a better surounding for their path of focus. There are also some children that undergo disabilities that prevents them from learning at the pace that average students would, making it harder for them to cope in the school enviornment. If they took online classes, they could go at the pace that they desired without the pressure of keeping up with other classmates. They wouldn't have to deal with getting to class on time either because they get to decide when they want to do a lesson. If a student is unfortunately forced to provide for themselves through a job, taking online classes may be the most recommended choice of learning so they can attempt to balance their proffession with their education. In opposition to these types of events, if a student didn't know how to use a laptop, phone, or tablet (etc), then online schooling would become a lot more complicated for them. Or if the internet and/ or all technological devices happen to collapse, then a student might want to plan on going to actual school or one-on-one learning because, well, that's the closest efficient alternative if this phenomena were to happen. Situations vary, so it is up to the student to depict what will affect them positively for their gain of intelect.

The type of education a student is aiming towards are better if taught through a certain source. For example, when learning something that tends to be more complex, like math, it's better to be in an actual classroom because of the type of area, where a teacher is present. If a student were to take online classes with this course, questions can't always be asked, especially if there is no conferencing for anyone to answer. When in confusion, their next option is to look up their question on the internet, but not every source is relaible, so how will the student truly know what is right and what is untrue? That's why it is better to have a professor or qualified teacher be accountable of answering any questions that a student may have and work iteractively so it's easier to understand. But if the subject is anatomy, a student would be able to learn it no matter the source (in class or online). This type of study is a matter of memorization and comprehension, it just depends on whether the student is willing to put in the work or not. Working in the presence of an educator or working independently at home should rely on what the student is aiming to learn, but the source should be thought through so the learning experience impacts the student in the right way and beneifially.

Attending classes at home can impact a student greatly or horribly, but it depends on who the student is, what they are going through, and what they are trying to learn. Online classes aren't made for everyone, and neither is going to school, but whatever enhances a student's intelect to the highest of their ability, is what is best for them.Â
