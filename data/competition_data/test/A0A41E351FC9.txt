Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question is should these projects be designed by the teacher or by the student. Normally the teacher designs the projects for the student however, it may be more beneficial if the students design the projects for themselves. There are multiple reasons why the students designing their own projects would be more beneficial, they can choose what they want to learn about, they can use their own creativity, and the teachers can learn more about what the students are interested in.

Firstly, the projects would be much more interesting if the students chose what they wanted to learn about. In other words, they would be way more intrigued and enthusiastic about a topic they like than a topic thats irrelevant to what they care about. Teachers usually give student mundane topics just to keep them occupied for the summer. But now the students can focus on something they care about and will be beneficial to them in life. For example, a teacher may want the students to do a project about the history of Germany but a student who has an interestÂ in becoming a doctor may want to do a project that involves researching the types of doctors that work in the hospital and what they do. See how the project designed by the student is most definitely more beneficial and more oriented towards the students interests.

Furthermore, the students can use this as an opportunity to tap into their own creativity. They now have the chance to create something that represents their own individual interests. The students can actually put their minds into their work and create something new and exciting, which would make them even more eager to learn. The students could work in groups and put their diverse creativity together.

Since the students will most likely design a project about something their interested in the teacher can has the opportunity to also learn something new. Like what their students like to do and would like to be when they grow up. The teacher could also try to measure the creativity of the students and implement a creative curriculum that matches the creativity of the students. Thus, increasing the students will to learn more.
