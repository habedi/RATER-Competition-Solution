Have you ever thought of joining the

"Seagoing Cowboys."

Like Luke Bomberger he thought it was an amazing program. Seagoing Cowboys take care of live stock that are being shiped to countrys or states. Luke Bomberger was asked to join with his friend Don Reist Luke could not give up this amazing opertunity so he toke it. Luke Bomberger decided to become a Seagoing Cow boy.

The year was 1945 World War ll had just ended in Europe and many outher contries. The army had just sent some Seagoing Cowboys. The Cowboys were sent to help restore food supplies and animals. 44 nations joined together for the UNRRA. The UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys." Luke and Don signed up to help with rebuilding Europe.

Luke signed up for the trip to go to Greece he turned 18 befroe going there. Besides going to places you would have the benifit of seeing sites such as Acroplis in Greece, or taking the gondola ride in venice Italy, a street with water. A Seagoing Cow boy also has very long trips to get to places somtimes like when Luke toke two weeks to get to the Atlantic Ocean or when it took a month to get to China. Seagoing Cowboys also have to care for thre animals and might run out of food to give them on one of there trips. A Seagoing Cowboys has thre advantages and their disavantages.

Seagoing Cowboys would have to leave their familys behind but they new that they would see them again. Seagoing Cowboys had a lot of fun on the trips that they came back from droping of the animals. They like to play games such as table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games. The games helped pass time until they got home to see there familys. One night Luke sliped and broke some ribs his crew would not let him work until he healed up. Seagoing Cowboys are like your family that is away from home.

When your part of the crew you have your own little family. When you go to what all the bad things in the world are you want to help them out . When Luke was done created awarness and that stayed with him. Luke hosted a number of internathinal students and exchange students visitors for many years. So go out there to help the people who really need it.
