Imagine sitting at home wrapped up in a blanket on a cold day while doing your school work in the comfort of your own space. Thats exactly what the setting could look like for students because some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because being at home is more comfortable, students could control their own school schedule, and students can work at their own pace.

A lot of students are afraid of saying stuff out loud or doing their work a certain way even if its right because there uncomfortable with the school environment and don't want to be made fun of. The first reason students would benefit from distance learning is because being at home is more comfortable, which when someone is comfortable they are a lot more open minded. Being open mind helps better ideas come off your head which could lead to better grades for that student if they weren't preforming well in school to begin with. A big problem for a lot of people is that they don't have confidence so when they go off in the world they dont trust themselves. School is supposed to help you for the future not break students confidence down just because someone is not comfortable in the school building environment. When humans are physically or mentality comfortable they feel confident at whatever they put their mind to which can lead to great success in the future.

Everyone has a busy schedule and by the time you get all your stuff done theres always that one last thing you have to do like a school project that you just rush to get done and you don't care what product of work your turning in. The second reason students would benefit from distance learning from home is because students could control their own school schedule. Whenever most people control their own schedule of whatever work they have, they get more work done because they know themselves the best and customize times they know there gonna do whatever work they have to do. There is no student who is ever 100% for every school day after repeatedly having to wake up so early, have after school activities,and have piles of homework.

Having control of there own schedule for school would give them ability to do school at a later time letting student sleep longer, then do those after school activities a non rushing fashion with energy from sleeping.

In school there are always gonna be incredibly smart students who are just wasting their time that day listening to multiple teachers baby every word they say so that every student in the classroom can understand. There are also always gonna be students who need to go back and listen again to understand what the teacher is teaching. The third reason students would benefit from distance learning from home is because students can work at their own pace at home. Students who have a learning disability have the option to work slowly and rewind the lesson as many times as they want to learn the material being taught without disturbing any of the other students pace like in a traditional classroom. Student who are incredibly smart can work at their fast pace of learning at home helping them get more work done and learning new things making them smarter quicker them traditional classroom.

Overall If schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, then the effect of learning on students will dramatically increase positively due to students being able to attend classes from home because of distance learning making it more comfortable for students , students making their own school schedule, and students can work at their own pace from home.
