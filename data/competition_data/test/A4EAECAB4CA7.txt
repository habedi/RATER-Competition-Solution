Phones and Driving

Cell phones are a distraction to the entire society today. A distracted driver using their cell phone is one of the most prominent reasons for car accidents. People should not be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Cell phones are a distraction and when being used while driving, could result in a car accident that might be fatal or in the least, cause serious injury to you or another innocent person.

When driving a car, the biggest distraction is a cell phone that is turned on and ready to receive calls and text messages. Even cell phone providers are moving towards advancements with applications that assist drivers to ignore their phones or mute them until the vehicle is not operational. Some states are passing laws that require drivers to place their cell phones in an area out of reach to the driver.

Several accidents and even fatalities have happened because of distracted drivers.

The driver might take their eyes off the road for a split second, and then return their eyes to the roadway and have no clue if they stopped at a stop sign or ran through a red light. When a driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text or find a phone number to make a call, the driver has just put their life and other lives into serious danger. Life as they know it can dramatically change with that one quick glance away from the road.

No person wants to live the rest of their life carrying the guilty burden and consequences of making a stupid decision; however, people do it every day.

Some distracted drivers are sitting in jail right now, with serious legal trouble, insurmountable debt for attorneys, and an unimaginable feeling of guilt because they made the decision to look away and either killed someone else or seriously injured someone. That life changing moment will haunt them for the rest of their life. Assuredly, they all wished they had that quick second or two back to not let the cell phone distract them.

Many people, for many years, traveled around the world with no cell phone or GPS, no Siri or Alexa to guide them, and certainly no distractions from text messaging or gaming opportunities. A distracted driver can be the cause of physical harm or even death to oneself or others. Why is it such a hard thing to put your phone down while driving? I am glad the state of Georgia passed the "Hands Free" or "Distracted Driver" law that states no cell phones should be touched by the driver of a vehicle. Too many people die every year because of distracted drivers that were either texting or talking while driving a vehicle. A loss of life is the most horrific experience any family member will deal with and most definitely the most senseless reason for a family to lose a loved one. Picture your parents answering the door to a police officer and the officer telling them you have been involved in a car wreck... it's the absolute worst nightmare for any parent. A cell phone, a message, a phone call - none of these are as important as a living, breathing human life. Please be a safe driver and put your cell phone away while driving.
