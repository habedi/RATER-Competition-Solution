Dear principal,

I don't think we should all have to do community service. some of us have responsibility's to do after school or take care of. Sometimes i have to go home to let my little brothers in or i have to pick them up from school because my mom has to work late.

If we had to do community services cleaning up out side to make the community better you should ask are parents before we do it . It should be like and every other Tuesdays or something and we should have to sign up for it. like there should be a time start to finish because like sometimes i have basketball practice after school until about 5:30. there are a lot of reasons why we should and we shouldn't and that's why you should get are parents signatures before we do community service. If we did community service sometime it should be like a detention for people who are being bad.

And like some elementary kids say yes it may take up some of are time because we don't all get to stay out all night so if we do community service we wont be able to hang out with are friends as much as we want to. And things we need to do at home. one way we could all do community service is it could be some time during school that are teachers take us out side to clean up to make are community look better.

sincerely ,
