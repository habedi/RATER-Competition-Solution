The "face" on mars is not a face at all, although it may look like a face it is not. The "face is very similar to some land formations on earth like a butte or a mesa. The "eyes" of the face and the "nose" of the face are just shadow on the rocks. The day that the picture of the "face" was taken it was cloudy and may have crated the shadows, or there are rocks that are higher up that created the shadows.

It is stated in the article that the "face" does not actually have eyes or a nose, that it was just the shadows that made them. scientists proved that it was not a face by takeing another more clear image of the "face", showing that it was a land formation and not an alien. They also proved that there were no alien pyramids, shacks, or any alien artifacts near the rock formation.

In conclusion the "face" is not an alien artifact or a giant head. the "face" is only a large land formation like a mesa or a butte like we have on earth.
