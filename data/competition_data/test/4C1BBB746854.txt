Dianee and she is going to eplain to you why the "face" was not created by aliens. It all started in 1976 when Viking 1 took a photo of the "face". The face was located in Cydonia it is two miles long from end to end. It looked like a face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. It is actually a mesa. Then,in 1998 the MOC wanted to take another picture because many people were saying that it was created by aliens. This picture would be in movies,books,magazines,radio talk shows and even in grocery stores for twenty five years.

When NASA let the public see this picture they believed it was created by aliens. We went back in 1998 and took some more pictures and it had still looked like a face but it was not. My people said that we (NASA) would rather hide then say that there was life on Mars, many conspiracy theorists were saying. We wouldn't hide we would tell the public so that we could get more money to be able to go to Mars and see these aliens.

What some people wanted was aliens and other people didn't. Mostly all the scientists at NASA including myself did not believe that the"face" was created by aliens. So in 2001 we went again to Mars to get a picture of the "face". It would be a clearer picture because the cameras were ten times better than the cameras in 1976 and in 1998. It was very hard to get to that exact spot on Mars. The face on Mars was 41 degrees north martian latitude. On April 8,2001 it was summer in Cydonia when we had taken the picture in 1998 it was winter and it was very cloudy. The camera was 1.56 meters per pixel in 1976 it was 43 meters per pixel.

So if there was objects on Mars like a plane of a pyramid we would know because we would be able to see it. We said that it was either a butte or a mesa. They are commom in the American West. It's kinda like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. They are basically lava domes but the one on Mars had looked like a face becasuse of the shadows. So,in conclusion the "face" is not created by aliens based on these facts.
