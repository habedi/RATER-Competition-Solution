Summer projects should be student-designed because it would motivate students to complete it, it's their break, and it would make it a little more fun for them. Assigning work over summer defeats the purpose in giving students a break to enjoy themselves, so I think they should make life a little easier for the students and let them design their projects. School is stressful and consumes most of the year, students need as much of a break as they can get for the short three months they get off.

As a teenager myself, I can honestly say some of us, (including me), have a little bit of trouble getting motivated. Whether it's our job, school work, or just simply cleaning our rooms, it can be a struggle for us to get off of our phones to do it. Something I have noticed is that when I have control over a situation, I am more motivated to do it. Summer projects would be no different. I know when I get a hand in designing my school work, there is a much higher chance I will actually want to do it.

Life as a teenager is more stressful then most people think. We have to focus on our grades, getting into college, and becoming an adult. Some of us even have a job to balance on top of that! Those are just a few examples of why teenagers need the three months on summer break to relax. Summer is an escape of the daily stress teenagers have to endure. It is only fair to allow the students freedom to design their own projects over their break from school.

School is one of the main focuses in life as a teenager. We are faced with a steady stream of work and knowledge during the school year. Even when we are out of school, we must choose which college to start the next chapter of our life at. The constant stress of our GPAs and test scores is too much to handle at times. Why must we extend this into the summer? I think allowing students to take their work into their own hands allows them to have a little bit of fun while still learning, and what better time to have fun then summer?

On the flip side, I understand why schools would want the teachers to design the projects for students. If teachers are designing it, there is less of a possibility of it not being educational. With that being said, students are ultimately the ones doing the project over their break, so I think it is only fair they have the power to design it themselves.

Teachers have nine months to teach students things they need to know. I think this is an abundant amount of time, if spent correctly, and there should be no need to extend work over summer break. If schools give out work to be completed over the students' break, by all means, students should have the ability to design it. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would motivate students to complete it, it's their break, and it would make it a little more fun for them.
