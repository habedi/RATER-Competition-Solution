The summer project shouldnt be made at all. because both students and teachers need a break from school . School shouldnt occur in the summer thats everyone break time from school. I also Believe that if the school should have a summer project i think that the; students should design it because after all the students are gonna be the ones working on it and the teachers are just gonna have to grade them. But the other bad part about it is some students are lose it most likely. And also i dont think that the teachers are gonna wanna grade a whole bunch of papers on the first day back .Its summer no every kid is gonna be focused on a project from school. The smarter thing to do would be to give the students the project on the first week back from summer break . so that way the students would not really have a choice but to do the project. Back to what i was saying,students should design the project so that way they get to make it how they want colors,designs and,etc. And if the students design it that might make them wanna do the summer project. If teachers design it students might no be as interested in doing the project because its not some thing they made on there own so it doesnt have any meaning to them . Moral of the story i dont really think that students should have a project in the summer time;but since they are getting one I think that they should be the ones designing it .
