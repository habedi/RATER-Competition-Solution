Hay you should go join the program of the cowboy or cow girl rode the waves.!

Why i say go join the progam is because you have the big's opptunity of your life to see and do neww thing's you never done befor. The resone that you should do this is because you can have that great's time of your ife to get out of the house and go arounld the word not only to see or eat but just be friendaly. Why not join this porgram to help your animals that you love.

You wnat be on your only becaues my dear old friend Luke the cowboy who rode the waves not onld did it one time but he did it nine time's he was loving to all the animals and he did do it all by him self he did it with his friend. I fill like every kid in the age of 17 shounld go and helpand become betterat wat they where used to likr playing on the phone or being on the phone. Kids like him just porbly was in the house playing vidoe games

Those are the the thing's that i think you should do or look into one day if your kid is being or doing bad in or outof school. Make sure that when me or engoht body go or do this they are better then be fir cause they have matte new friend's and did ne thing's.
