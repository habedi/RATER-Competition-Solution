Students' are not getting any benefit from doing their work from their house. Some students' don't learn anything from their house because they won't focus on what they are watching. Majority of students' are listener and visual learners because they learn more when you see it in person and on paper. They wouldn't be learning as much as they could since they could be skipping the videos and be doing the assignments that the teacher assign them. Everyone learns differently from each other.

Some students' don't learn anything from their house because they won't focus. They could be getting distracted by other things like watching TV, listening to music and listening to their mom. Also they could be the type of student that gets distracted by every little thing. Majority of students are listener and visual learners because they learn more like that. Students' learn more by listening to a teacher because it will help you focus more on the topic the teacher is talking about. When you are just watching a video from your own house it's different because you might get lost and might not know what the video is trying to explain. Some students' are visual learners that like to write every single thing down or just like to see it in paper not just on a computer that you cannot write on it or anything like that. They wouldn't be learning as much as they could since they could be skipping the videos and be doing the assignment that the teacher assign them. They could just go straight to the assignment and not watch any video they had to be watched. They could be doing their assignment and act like they watch the videos they had to watched. Students' just want to rush with their assignment so they don't have to worry about it no more.

Some people say it depends on the type of person who you are. It also depends on how you wanna learn things. For example some students' want to learn on their own others would like a teacher to talk to them and explain things better. Some students' are different from each other they learn different ways. Not every one is the same from each other. They're many ways that students' can learn things. They could learn by their parents explaining things, a paper that a teacher wrote with explanation on it and even by a teacher explaining things. Everyone is not the same they learn differently from others.

Students' that work on their assignment at home aren't really getting any benefit. They wouldn't be getting any help from their teacher. Also if no one was at home with the student their wouldn't be any help from anyone. They could learn by their self but it could be hard if they didn't understand what the video is trying to explain. They aren't really getting any benefit working on their assignment from their house because they aren't getting any help from anyone and no one is there to explain what they aren't understanding.
