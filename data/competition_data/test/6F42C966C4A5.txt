Exploring venus would be a pretty cool idea but theres lots of things that could go wrong to fast. the temp is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. All thought Venus is a challenge to explore it is every easy to see at night , its the bigest "star in the sky". There're many different ways to see Venus and to explor it , they have lots of places where you can go see most plants and learn lots from it.

The "NASA" is mostly known for the plants and how we found out most fasinating wonders about them. NASA has lots of compelling ideas for studying venus. They have came up with lots of details about venus like, how "The atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets." They also talk about how the atmospheric pressure is 90 times geartet than what we experiencevon our own planet.

They have lots of other big problems why Venus is hard to explore but i think that what i picked is the biggest things i ppointed out.
