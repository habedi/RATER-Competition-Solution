Dear Principal;

I think you should not make it mandatory that we do community service because there is just no time in the day.

We have to do all of our homework, our extra curricular activities and study for the many tests we have.

In school our teachers give us at least 2 sheets of homework a night plus studying for the many test we have. I would typically have 2 test a day so that is an extra 2 hours of studying i have to do at minimum. If I don't get the subject matter i have a test on then i will have to just keep on studying until i get it, including re-reading and practice/

Also, we have extra curricular activities we do. For example; Football, Cheer leading, Cross country and more. We do these sports and activities to help our concentration and our physical strength.

The students at your school do not have the time for more requirements to do. I, for one, would end up worrying about getting all my requirements done then study for tests at 3 in the morning because then I would have completed all my home work. And by the time I finished studying I would be able to get about 1 hour maybe 1 hour and 30 min. I would end up coming into school about to fall asleep on my desk or on the floor.

We don't have enough time and already have to much on my plate so i ask you don't make it mandatory maybe just extra credit but not a requirement.

Sincerely; A Concerned Student
