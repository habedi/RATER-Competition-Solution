I think luke can bring people to ride the waves because luke has a friend that like riding waves but luke hasn`t rode a wave yet. Luke has so much of enthusiasum to go on this once in the life time trip. Luke also went to ride wave s with is friend because luke wanted to help people that was injured in world war II. Luke turned eighteen while going to Greece. Luke knew that ment to be in the military sevices.

I think luke could bring society in because riding waves can be fun. For luke its absoulutley fun because he was waiting for a long time for his friend to tell him ''want to go ride some waves with me?'' Said lukes friend. If I was going to ride waves. I would bring my family like mom,dad,sister,sister,and me.

Conclusion.

My conclusion is that if it is very hot outside. Ride the waves if you live by the ocean or at a hotel by the ocean. The other thing is live your life until you cant live it any more.
