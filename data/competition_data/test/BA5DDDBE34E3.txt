The article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is a well written article about the knowledge we have about Venus. Scientists have been fascinated with the planet's characteristics, such as its weather patterns, orbital route, as well as Venus's geology. Even though we have quite a bit of information about the planet, there are still many things that we do not know about Venus. The author heavily advocates the need of exploring Venus for multiple reasons.

The article mentioned how scientists refer to Venus as Earth's twin. Venus shares a very similar size, density, and distance with our planet. The main issue with Venus is that the weather can be chaotic and unpredictable, as well as the planet's atmosphere and living conditions. However, while those factors may not be ideal, they could still be survivable for humans if we had the propper equipment

Another reason the article states is that Venus could have been the most similar planet to Earth. Scientists believe that Venus might have had large oceans similar to Earth's modern day oceans. This information alone is one of the reasons why scientists want to explore the planet more. We may be able to understand more about Earth's oceans through the possible oceans that used to exist on Venus.

One of the last reasons the author listed was that Venus is one of the closest destinations for us to visit. It will most likely be a long time before any human travels outside of the solar system, but a planet such as Venus would make the most sense to travel to. While it does sound phenomonal to attempt to land on Venus, it would be extremely dangerous to do so. There is nothing easy about traveling in space, and Venus's climate is too unpredictable to even reach its surface.

The article has many pieces of evidence that support the idea of studying Venus. Some of those ideas are currently very dangerous and improbable to even attempt, but they are still very good goals to strive for. The article sheds light on the importance of exploration, as well as the idea that there is an endless amount of knowledge beyond our understanding. Even if we fail, it is through our attempts that we continue to learn.
