In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile,by Nick D'Alto, talks about the software,the Facial Action Coding System that can read emotional expressions. I believe that the use of the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom of student is valuable because it's helpful and convinate.

The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom because it can help teachers and students. For example in paragraph six it states,"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could notify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". This can give advantages to teachers and students because student might be afraid to ask what the lesson was about and not ask when the software can also help.

The software is also coninvate because it can also be used to see how a someone's day is. For example in paragraph five it states "For instance, you can probabaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face", yes you can tell how that person is feeling by the look of thier face but they might be hiding their feelings. This is where now the software takes in place and is able to tell how the person is actually feeling and the software can notify a teacher and theteacher could actually talk to that person that has things going on and help them out.

The softaware can do so many things that a actually human being wouldn't actually detect, it can help students and teacher at the same time and it would make a drastic change, not just for education but, also society.
