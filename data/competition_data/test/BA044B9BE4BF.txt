New codeing software that can read facial expression and then determin emotion. How will this be used and to what can it be applied to in schools to help teachers. How will this help teacher plane activites in the classroom. How much would it cost for a school to get and to use.

Teachers and how will emotion reading software help them in the classroom and what would it have to be on for it to work. I think that it whould help teachers in many ways one of the main thing I see it being used for is to help teachers to see what there student are haveing troulble with and then the teacher can help students that are haveing trouble with certain things helping students learn better.

teacher will be able to plan around the students needs it a class. If the student under stand how to do something the teacher can move on past it that lession or if certain student need more help so they can focase more on those certain student and give them the help that they need and move on after they under stand. Helping teacher plan there classroom day on the need of the students.

When the software bug free will be cheap to schools to use in the class rooms? The software is not a cheap thing so will all schools be able to use it and if it is will the computers be able to use it? I think it will help teacher alot with planing thigs in there classrooms and help student but i dont think that it will be to costly for all schools to have it and have the right tecnology to run the software.
