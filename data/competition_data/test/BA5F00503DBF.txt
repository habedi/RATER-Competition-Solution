dear principle,

People who like to participate in sports should just be allowed to do what they love. some people just cant get their grades up in time for a game. So i think that you should reconsider your thoughts on this topic. But I also agree with you because I think that playing sports is a reward. So in order to get that reward you have to earn it.

I understand that you may have your reasons about this and why you think that in order to play sports you have to have a certain grade, but you should consider what the students think and believe should happen. Because if you don't there might be a lot of people that might be angry with you.

I also think that you should encourage the students to get better grades so that they'll want to learn and get better grades. Maybe you could make learning fun, but I will let you decide it. I completely understand.

If you would like to make students get better grades, you should make the activities much more fun and tell them that if they want to participate that they'll have to get better grades in order to participate. I hope that you will consider and respect my opinion on this topic. I also hope that you will try to make these things possible for the students . thank you very much.
