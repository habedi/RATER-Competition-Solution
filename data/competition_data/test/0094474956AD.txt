Dear principal:

I think performing a community service is a great idea. It will help the students be better with people and will look good in their high school or college applications. If everyone does community service, we will have a better world by helping each other. In this case, crime rates would be lower and there would be good influence on other people.

If I had to make this decision, I would definitely go for community service. It will help the community around you and people will start to make a better choice in their lives. For example, you can walk dogs around your neighborhood, clean up trash with your friends, and a lot more to make our Mother Earth cleaner. When I'm older, I'm planning to volunteer at a children's hospital and tutor them or read so they won't feel like they're missing out in school. I think this is a great idea because you're helping the kids and you just feel satisfied about it.

Another thing you can do is go to a shelter home and feed the homeless food. This will help the homeless people and they won't be that hungry. Instead of making community service an extra credit, you should make everyone do it and help them in their later lives. For example, bullies especially should do community service. They always pick on people and they think that's funny when it's not. If they do community service, they can become a better person and they won't pick on people has much as before, which is a huge difference.

I think doing community service would not take too much time because you're doing something that's good and you can always do it with your friends. It won't be as bad as they think it is. Later on, it will be very helpful to them when they apply to colleges. Most colleges look at what you did in the past like what sports you played, what kind of clubs you were in, if you play any instruments, or if you did any community work. You will definitely get extra points just because of the community work that you did. Not only you'll have to get good SAT scores, but you should always look at what your future holds by making a big difference. Remember, one person can make a huge difference if you just help out the community.

Maybe you'll consider it and make the right decision. You never know, many people will thank you for what you did to their education and you can help by stopping bullies picking on people and you can make the crime rate lower by choosing for what's right.
