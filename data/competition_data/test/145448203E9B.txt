People think that aliens are real, but has any human being ever seen one? No they haven't. People just assume that aliens are real becuase of TV, comics, books, and movies, but in 1976, Viking 1 took a photo and saw a face on Mars. People think it was an alien life form that created this.

NASA used all there research and what they know to figure out what this was. Some people think that it was just an illusion created by shadows giving it eyes, nose, and a mouth. It reminds some people of landforms like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho or any landform they think that comes close with it. It could've just been a metreo that hit Mars and formed it. I think it was just a natural landform.

We may never know what it truly is. There have been many weird things in space that we could never figure out. Some of those things are just normal stuff that happens in space and some people don't know that happens. It could've just been a normal thing that happen and everyone thinks it's a big piece of information of aliens.

People make hypothesis way to quickly based off of what they've seen and heard. Not all things are true. No one has truly seen an alien before and if there were aliens shouldn't have people already have seen one? Earth has been around for a long time and nobody has seen and alien life form.
