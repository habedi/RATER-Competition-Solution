Space exploration has been a fascination of mankind for multiple centuries now, but has only become a reality in the past 50-60 years. In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author is supporting the idea of space exploration to Venus or our "sister planet". However, the author's claims do not make up for a good arguement against all the dangers and risks that are presented.

Firstly, instead of responding to opposing claims with arguements to push their points, they give them to the reader and let's them get to decide what side they fall on. They list factual evidence on the basis of weather, geology, and risks that would take place. Such as, the atmospher of Venus is thick with a nearly 97 percentage od carbon dioxide and the planets clouds are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Not to mention, the author states that, "no spaceship survived the landing [on Venus] for more than a few hours", they share information like that with the readers with no rebuttal, and only carries on to say what NASA has planned. It's a weak strategy to take if they're trying to convice the reader to be open about exploration of Venus.

Second, the author uses examples and ideas NASA has put out to make reality of the trip to Venus. Although, most people would be more leaning towards rational planning, the way the author describes the progress is once again, weak. They tell the readers of a mission that would carry men, which has never been done before, in a "blimp- like vehicle" that would hover 30 miles or so above the surface of Venus. The temperatures are still around 170 degrees farenheit and he claims their "not easy conditions, but survivable for humans". In the paragraph after, the author states issues, such as, how no photography or videography would be rendered ineffective and that researchers would not be able to collect samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. They then go on to say, "Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks". The risks heavly outweigh the pros on this mission.

Third, the risks of this mission would far exceed any benefit that would be gained. Humans believe that Venus may have carried life forms because it was covered by oceans, however, it would not be sutible for any life now. The risks included in this mission would be major ones that anyone could see with a brain. Loss of life, loss of materials, loss of funding, and loss of the risk of something catostrophic are four major risks that will never out way the "pros" of exploration and knowledge. The author uses a quote at the end of the page that states, "our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..." is that a reality or just a false reliance to convince others.

Finally, all this information and rebuttal put forth shows that author does not make a strong arguement to support his ideas. The reality of this situation is, is it worth the damage for the things we will "discover" if we discover anything at all. This is just another proof that curiosity needs to be grounded before you can make it into a reality.
