I don't think they should bring cell phones to school because when the loose the cell phone they start searching everyone and accusing other people or if they look sucpicious and then we get in trouble and whoever lost the cell phone will be crying or if someone else buys the same one as the one the person lost they will tell someone that's my phone and there will be a fight . or the principal will tell who ever gets a phone it is not his job to take of that phone you could only use them during lunch or nutrition if they steel it or gets lost too bad for them they wanted a cell phone now they have to take care of it . You will be able to bring phones to school if you take of it and not use it in class you also will need your cell phone after school to call your parents to pick you up or tell them your going to a friends house so they could know where your at.
