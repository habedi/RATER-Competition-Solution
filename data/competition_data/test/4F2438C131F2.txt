Imagine your'e principal made extracurricular activities outside of school mandatory, activities outside of school can be a good way to socialize with your'e peer's, but there are some drawbacks to forced extracurricular activities. Activities outside of school can be a good thing if they are willingly done by the person, compared to being forced into doing an activity. Studies have shown that if someone is forced into doing a selected activity, they wouldn't enjoy it as much as they would compared to the person doing the activity willingly. Some student's already are doing things outside of school such as, helping at their local food bank, volunteering at their church, or they could just be leading a small study group. There are some student's out there that aren't interested in doing anything outside of school either because they can't or they just don't want to do anything after dismissal time. For some student's, activities outside of school could really help their social skills by exposing them to a new environment, with new people, and new challenges to face. In conclusion doing things outside of school could be a good thing for students if they do it willingly and if there are many options to choose from,not just activities associated with school, but continuous activities in the community too.

When doing activities outside of school there can be many things to choose from. Some activities that student's can get involved in outside of school may include volunteering at a local non-profit, organizing a study group, or it could be as simple as doing a sport, the possibilities are virtually endless! If your'e principal made it so that the extracurricular activity was some how associated with school, there are still plenty of options out there. Some activities that may be associated with your'e local school may include sports, yearbook club,National Junior Honor Society, or even a chess club, there is still a lot you can do after school, but not as many activities you could do that isn't associated with school. There are some districts that have already implemented this into their schools, which for most of the schools they had to add more clubs that fit the students interests. A resent study shows that the students who did extracurricular activities preformed better on a social IQ test compared to students who didn't do any activities outside of school. If schools did implement this change they would need more staff to lead the clubs or to form new clubs to fit the students needs, thats why it would be best if the school system stayed the same with a few minor changes to the systems.

Activities can be healthy for students, if the students like what they are doing. Students may not want to do things after school, except to just go home. While there are some kids who absolutely love to do things outside of school because it can be a good social experience for them. A survey recently done by a New York institute, seventy five percent of the time when teens are forced into something they resent and do the opposite of what is told of them. To sum every thing up, The school systems should allow the students to have free choice of what they do, schools need to make the kids of tomorrow more independent and allow them to choice their own path of what they want to do.
