I am not for or against driverless cars. Driverless cars, in my opinion, have no impact on me. If people are for or against them then that's cool, I really don't care. Driverless cars will just add onto the list of how to be lazy for us. I would think it'd be pretty cool to have dirverless cars simply because it'd show how far we've advanced in technology. Driverless cars could be a benefit and hazard to us depending on when/where they would be distributed. It will probably take another few years before we're able to just sit back and relax as our car takes us to our destination without us having to pay attention because of A LOT

of things, but the biggest factor would be humans. It will be a while before technology can react like humans do. If there are a bunch of carless drivers who have normal cars, how would the computers react? Would they be break-happy and keep pumping the breaks every other second to avoid an accident? Would they just continue on and cause an accident? Or would driverless cars be like a requirement? Every vehicle has to have a computer so it can drive itself. That would be safe, it would cause less accidents for people who like to drink their troubles away and get drunk every other minute. It would prevent lots of problems on the road for those who text and drive or who just don't pay attention.

I know I didn't write this how I was supposed to and I really don't care. Sorry, but my education means little to nothing to me. At least I typed that much though, right?
