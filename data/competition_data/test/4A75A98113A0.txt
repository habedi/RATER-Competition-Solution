Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Teachers give students summer projects to make sure that we are still learning and not forgetting information that we already know and to keep working the students brain. I agree with teachers assigning students a summer project because it lets the students be creative and learn in a fun way.

I agree that summer projects should be student designed because it will show what the students have learned and it would show what they need to improve on. Students will be learning more because the students would be researching to find information and they would learn new information. Students can learn and be involved with the project and it would raise your grade if it is low. If the student is bored and has nothing to do than they can work on the project.

Also, students can be creative and design the project how they want to do it. Being creative is great because it lets the student show what they got and just have fun with it. Being creative can lead to positive thinking and makes the students feel like they can do it. Students love making projects how they want to and makes them think and brainstorm to see how they will make it look like they gave it all they had. Students love being creative and the students learn while being creative on the project and to show how much potential the students have in them.

Some students find the topic they get for the project interesting and joyable. If students like the topic then they will do more research and learn and have fun with the project. Student designed projects will let the students have fun and research and learn about the topic and let the students explore. Student designed projects will be better for the students and let them show you what they learned and researched about and to let them show how creative they are. Students having teacher designed doesn't let them be creative and let them research and find information and to let them show what they have learned. This is why teachers should give the students designed summer project to the students and why it is helpful.
