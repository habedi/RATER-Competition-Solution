Cell phones. Almost everyone has them but over the past couple of years have they became a issue where they have caused peoples life's. Many people find the time to be on there phones anywhere at anytime they want including while driving. People have been putting each other in danger just to see a text or a notification while not paying attention to the road this simple action can cause a person to lose there life.

Image a teenage girl first time on the road and is finally able to have her freedom and rights of driving. The girl is driving carefully and responsibly until she gets a notification from her boyfriend saying "we need to talk". The girl hesitates to answer the text message while she is looking back and forth from the road to her phone until she finally grabs the phone from the cup holder. She started to text back her boyfriend while running a red light and getting T-boned on her side of the car causing a crash. This is just one of the million possibility's that could happen while texting and driving. This is also a reason as to why under no conditions should a person text while drive. What if the girl didn't pick up the phone? What if instead she turned it off or pulled over onto the side of the road. A text message will be there forever but your life dose not.

Not only are you putting your life at risk but you are also putting other peoples life at risk. For example there's a man driving a truck and just got a text message from his wife he figures that since there is no one on the road nothing bad would happen so while he is texting while driving he dose not notices a boy riding a bike crossing the street he looks up from his phone and realizes whats about to happen and steps on the breaks on time. What if he didn't stop on time what if he kept texting. his actions did not effect him but it effected others such as that little boy. This is why for no reason should you text call or face time while drive it dose not matter how you do it you are still putting other peoples life at stake including your own.

In conclusion drivers should never text while drive because you are then putting your life and others at risk. If only drivers would think before they do something then maybe more people would be alive today. Maybe the girl in the car crash would be alive today maybe the boy riding his bike would be alive today. Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. You are not only driving for yourself but for everybody. A text message can last forever but your life will not.
