The thing is that 25 years ago a face appeared on Mars. Nasa said that it looked like someone looking up through tha camera at them whcih is very creepy. Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority says, says the article.

Don't get me wrong I do think that it is just a normal landfrom but, if you really look at it then it actually isnt a regular landfrom. To me it looks like the shadows on mars are creeping up on the mass of rock or sand or whatever it is. Like the scientists said the creeping up shadows is what gave the landform a the eyes the mouth and the nose.

But, this face they say is actually called a mesa. From all the years it has went through such as 1976 to 2001 I would say that the face is now older and deformed. The article says what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa."It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho" says Gavin. They also says it's not easy to target Cynodia.

So when people say that the face is an actual face they are wrong becaus e if they would actually read a article on the mesa/face . They would see that they are not right at all they are just wrong. Beacus ethe shadows are what gave the massive the landform the eyes and the mouth and the nose. Remembe rthis they first discovered it in 1976 , and they kept on lokking at throughout the years. I think that it was an awesome thing to discover.
