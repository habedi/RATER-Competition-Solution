Over the years distance learning has become more of a norm. Many people used to consider online school to be lesser than physical, but the results that have come from online have shown to give positive and effective results. Students would benefit from attending classes at home giving them more of a stress free environment and more flexibility.

When many people think of online school they might quickly jump and think that there are a lot of negatives and that physical school would ideally be the better option for students, but when you compare the two options you would be surprised as to what online school provides. In recent years school has never caused so much stress or anxiety to students. Students receive this stress from many factors like peers that compare themselves to one another, which causes a sense of competition and comparison for the student to think that they are not "as smart". There is lots of stress from society as well in the youngest generation, pushing them in that they have to be successful, the top of the class, and this is caused by schools and peers. With online school, it provides the student to work in an environment they feel comfortable in, and by being at home or some other environment they are less in risk to be stressed out and compare themselves to other students with academics. Students can also work at their own pace and thoroughly understand the information they are learning, which positively enforces learning. When students are pushed on this one idea, and it is heavily forced upon them, they are likely to resent it. With this stress, it can cause students to start to hate learning, and give that sense of resentment towards the school system. Pushing students so much can cause burn out, which can give long term effects on a student with heavy disregard for school and education as a whole. This environment has only increased over the years, and has already given effects like mental health issues shown in students.

Online school allows students to learn the same information, but in an environment that will suit them better or provide the comfort of less pressure to the child. Some may say that will too much comfort, the student will start to slack in school. Though the student can choose when to start school and their own hours, they need to complete a certain amount a day to stay on course, and though it also depends on each student, majority show positive results and that they stay on track with their courses by being somewhere they feel comfortable and more a ease to. Each student has a unique situation so it also depends on that, for example, many students start to pursue their careers or are able to follow their dreams early. By having online schooling, kids are able to do this and it gives them flexibility in their schedules' for school and to continue with their dreams. Many student athletes that are on the road to the Olympics, or students that have started a business and that do not have the time to go to school for most of the day, will take online schooling to focus on those other things. Many people might think that is being a bad student not prioritizing school, but many students already have gotten a jump start to their future and don't need to be attending full time schooling, or just physical school. People like Micheal Phelps, and Simone Biles would not be as successful as they are today if they did not switch from attending physical school to online school, and it goes to show that you can do online school and still be just or even more successful. This option of having online school for these types of students is highly beneficial by giving them that flexibility.

People will make the argument that online school doesn't provide the needs for student education or the interaction and relationships they get from school, but if a student is having trouble learning online, they can video chat an actual teacher to get help and talk to a teacher, just like they would if they went physically to school. The student would not be teaching themselves, they would have assistance and support from real teachers if they need explanation or other help. The education portion of online schooling is very similar to physical, but there are huge mental differences for the student. Online provides the proper aid and positive mental health responses from the student allowing them to still enjoy school and education.
