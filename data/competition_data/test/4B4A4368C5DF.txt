Facial Action Coding System could potentially be valuable in the classroom. For students with autism or some other form of mental disease, picking up on certain emotions and being able to tell how people are feeling does not come quite as easy as it does for other people. For them to have some sort of technology to help them learn how to tell what people are feeling could be a fantastic use of our worlds rapid technological advances.

To use this technology on students computers in order to tell how they are feeling and what confuses them or what they understand is a different story. In some ways, this could be a good thing because it would notify teachers when their students simply are not understanding a topic. But it also seems like a slight invasion of privacy and it seems that some people would not enjoy software that could detect your face and facial features at all times.

Our world has been making huge technological advances for awhile now. In just 40 years we went from the computer game Pong to having Virtual Reality. This kind of technological advance would be big but quite frankly not so shocking. Software that makes a 3-D model of your face and calculates your muscle movement in order to detect emotion is somewhat terrifying in the sense that a computer can now detect how you feel, but in some situations this technology could be useful.
