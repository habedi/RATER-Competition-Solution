I don't think driverless cars are really that important. It's interesting, and would be cool but not important. I believe a lot of people would buy them. The purpose of driving is supposed to be exciting for you, instead they're driving for you. All together they're not important, dangerous, could cause accidents, but could be interesting.

Driverless cars are not important, I believe that just driving regularly is better that the car doing it for you. There are still cars that people could drive just fine. I don't see why people would want their car to drive for them.

Driverless cars could cause accidents. I think if a careless teen would be driving it, they could think that car would be doing all the work. They would think that they don't need to focus. There are already problems with texting a driving, imagine if they thought they could text because the car is doing all the work. In the article it says that the car needs you to be alert at all times incase they come across work zones. I think that could cause accidents.

I believe that many people are careless drivers. People could get used to the idea of the car taking care of everything, in the article it says that the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Which could cause people to do things they could never do if they had to pay attention at all times. Someone could be paying attention to other things in the car instead of steering and cause an accident.

The thought of driverless cars is very interesting, I would be more accepting of them if I knew they were safe, and no one would get hurt. Someone who's been driving for a long time, I think would be more interested in it. New drivers who aren't used to driving would probably want to drive by themselves. I think the driverless car could be very useful to people who take trips that are far, and need to relax.

Overall, I think the driverless car isn't important, dangerous, could cause accidents, but could be interesting. I personally wouldn't want one, but others might be very interested. It could cause accidents to happen, especially if the driver is careless. It is an interesting invention though, the idea of having a car drive for you is cool. But I don't think it's worth the risk.
