Phones & Driving

While driving you're main point of focus should be on the road. A great number of people own a cell phone and the sudden urge to use it while operating a vehicle can be very tempting. There are many reasons, opinion, and facts based on why i think people should and shouldn't use cell phones while on the road. There are pros and cons depending on the situation. Here's why i think people should not use a cellphone while driving.

Using your phone is already a distraction and driving just makes it more worse than it is. While driving you have a lot responsibilities and using a phone just makes it harder to focus. Using a phone while driving is also probably illegal. In certain cases it is highly likely that you will receive a ticket. You can easily save yourself a ticket by just waiting till you are out of the vehicle reply to a text or call. Another reason is the passengers if anyone else is in the car. It is your responsibility to keep everyone in the vehicle safe. Using a phone while driving can increase the chance of a crash by a lot putting your life and the life of the passengers at risk. You can also put pedestrians at risk if you are not paying attention. There are also some reasons why i think it can be okay sometimes for people to use cellphones while driving.

A main reason can be a emergency. Sometimes things happen at unfortunate times while you are driving, but that still is no excuse for you to use a phone while driving. Maybe waiting at the light to reply can sometimes be okay as long as you are paying attention. If you need to call or answer a call you can maybe put the phone on a mount so that your hands are still on the wheel and you still have your focus on the road. I personally know people who do this and in my opinion it's the safest way to answer the phone hands free while all your attention is still on the road. If you get a text or a call and you really can't help yourself, find somewhere to park. It doesn't take that long and it can save your life, the life of others, and reduce the chance of getting into a crash.

There's a lot of facts that show why texting and driving can be so fatal. 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the fact that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but 35% still admit to doing it, while 21% get into fatal crashes due to texting and driving. The percentage to get in a crash while texting and driving increased by 23%.

Answering a text takes your attention away for about 5 seconds and while going at 55 mph, that's enough to the length of a football field without even looking at the road. There are an endless amount of facts and statistics about this, and reading some to obtain the knowledge about this danger is great for your safety and the safety of others.

In conclusion, i don't think anyone should text and drive in under any circumstances because you are increasing the chance of a crash and risking lives. There is no excuse to why you should even pick up a phone while driving. If you absolutely have to because of an emergency or other reasons then you can park and take care of it from there. It's much safer and you can be saving lives
