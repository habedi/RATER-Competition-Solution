Dear Senator,

I am arguing in favor of changing the Electoral College to the election of by popular vote. The process of the votes going through the various different places until it finally gets counted and determined who wins the state is unneccesary. The system is not even fair, for example in the year 2000 Al Gore had one the popular vote by 60%. Unfortunatley he lost the presidency because he did not win the the votes of the Electoral College. For a counry that is ran by the people, a vote of over 50% should always win. When you take into consideration how big the United States are, then cut that into half it is still a remarkable amount. Now picture a little over half the people in the United States voting for the same thing.

This process led to the "biggest election crisis in a century" says Bradford Plumer. According to this source the system can also allow for much worse. He even says that at the most basic level the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the Winner-take-allsystem that occurs in each state. For the purpose of common sense why would we as a republic use a system that is "unfair"?

Richard A. Posner says that the method of using the Electoral College method may even restrain potential voters for a specific candidate. All because they know that they're votes will have little to no impact on the outcome of the election. This also leads to the fact that would have no logical reason to pay attention to the campaign they would've picked. Plumer quotes that " the Electoral College is outdated,unfair, and that Bob Dole was right in saying that we as acounty should abolish the Electoral College".

When everything is added up  the same words such as unfair,outdated,useless, and unnessary keep coimg up on this topic. Not everybody in this country enjoys the use of the Electoral College and  I strongly feel that eventually in this country the Electoral college will be left in the past and new methods of voting will be of greater use.
