Imagine a world where everything you need is within walking distance. This is what our society could become if we stop relying on cars. If we stop using cars we could largely cut down on greenhouse gasses and polluted air. No cars means no stress of dumb drivers, DUI, and car-related deaths.

First, if we stop using cars as the main mode of transportation, buildings would be closer to homes to accomodate people walking to them instead of driving. This saves money because you don't need a car, gas, or insurance. A closer and more condensed society means communities could be formed where everyone knows everyone, like back in the old days with city-states and villages.

Secondly, cutting back on cars means cutting back on air pollution and greenhouse gasses. Less greenhouse gasses equals a cooler and more healthy earth. Air pollution is a big problem in places like china, france, and some european countries. If we get rid of most cars, the air there will be much more pleasant and breathable. The sky would also become more clear.

In conclusion, cutting back on cars could be beneficial to the whole world, communites would be formed, everything you need would be in walking distance, there would be less car related deaths, and greenhouse gasses and air pollution would greatly decrease, making the earth and its people healthier.
