Dear Principle,

I understand your concern for the cell phone policy but i would like to voice my opinion. With being a student myself i can assure you that the opinion of myself falls for most of the student body attending this school.

Cell phones are not just a piece of technology we carry around to look cool. For most of us it is our life line. It keeps us connected to the things going on around us. With today's dangers increasing it tends to make us feel better knowing that at anytime we could wip out our phone and call for help. Its about security. With half of the students needing to walk home after the school day, our phones are a necessity. Without it who would know if we were in trouble? I understand phones may be used as a distraction but you can not simply think banning phones from school property is going to fix anything.

If you ask any member from any school they would probably admit that even if it were not allowed, their cell phones would probably still make their way into their pockets during class. We are simply too attached to let go of our source of communication. Why don't you save yourself all the detentions and parent calls and not make it one of those things people would have to sneak around to have? To me that just sounds like your promoting bad behavior, and who wants that in a school?

I ask that instead of getting rid of phones for good, make a few simple rules as to cage the distractions from occurring. Maybe making phones only available during lunch or passing period when we are not using our brains for school work. As long as they are turned off in class then the distractions should be kept to a minimum thus leaving the school a more focused environment for all.
