Dear Principal:

Changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is admirable. I completely agree with it due to the fact that education comes before sports. If the student wishes to play sports, then they must be able to perform academically before athletically. Our teachers preach this to us but it was never truly enforced among us students. Now that it will be, however, added to all the other regulations grades will be above par.

Allowing students to see that if they desire to get involved in sports that they must first improve their grades will spark their ambition, causing them to budge over and above. There are plenty of students who would do what it takes to get what they simply want because of the fact that this school teaches us to earn what we wish as well as what they learn at home. Other students who are not so forthcoming to this can usually be influenced by the other students. After all, getting exceptional grades is listening and doing as we are told. This may also help students to learn other ways and the decency of achievement.

Therefore, i do agree with the changing in the school policy. This new change will better our school's scores as well as the students' attitude toward other things in life. Having a B average will get pupils into college more than a C average would most likely do.

If their grades are excellent then that could do more for their performance athletically since they would have less on their minds when playing. Never the less, this is a wonderful idea.

Sincerely,
