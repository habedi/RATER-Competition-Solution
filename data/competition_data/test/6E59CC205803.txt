Over the summer, teachers often assign summer projects to ensure that students are still learning during their break. Usually, these projects are challenging and time-consuming, making students dread them. Occasionally, students will get to choose what they want to do for their summer projects, making them seem less like school work. Although some people say that summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would be more challenging, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests, they would be more enjoyable, and they would show an increase in the effort level of students.

To begin with, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests. Student-designed projects would allow students to not only choose the topic of their project, but also their method of presentation. This would mean that each student's project would be entirely different. For example, Generic_Name may choose to do a PowerPoint presentation on lacrosse, while Generic_Name may choose to write a speech on global warming. Students would be able to be more creative and complete projects that truly showcase who they are and what interests them. Each student's interests would be highlighted and the projects would allow teachers to learn more about each student personally before the start of a new school year. Along with allowing students to be more creative and allowing teachers to learn more about their students, student-designed projects would also be more fun for teachers to grade. Rather than having to grade different papers about the same topic over and over again, teachers would get to see a variety of topics and ideas, making grading more enjoyable for them. For example, if a teacher-designed summer project were to ask students to write a paper on whether dogs or cats make better pets, grading would become very boring. However if students were allowed to choose their own topic, showcasing their individual interests, grading would become more exciting for teachers. Student-designed summer projects should be encouraged because they would highlight each student's interests.

Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because they would be more enjoyable. By allowing students to choose their own project, teachers would be making summer projects seem less like school work. If a students were to choose their own project, they would be able to choose something that interests them rather than something that they do not care about, allowing the project to become more enjoyable. For example, if Generic_Name were to choose her own topic for her summer English project, she would likely choose volleyball. But if her English teacher were to choose the topic for her project, Generic_Name could end up writing about lizards, a topic that she shows no interest in, making the project dreadful. If teachers were to allow students to design their own projects, students could choose a topic that they are truly interested in, making summer projects more fun.

Lastly, summer projects should be student-designed because they would show an increase in the effort level of students. Students would become more motivated to work on their projects if they were able to choose what type of project they got to complete. In addition, students would put more effort into their projects because they may not know how the teacher is going to grade them. For example, if teachers were to design summer projects then students would likely have an understanding of what the teacher expects and how they will be grading the project. In contrast with teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects would allow students to have more uncertainty as to how the teacher will be grading. Worried about their grades, students would try to supply the teacher with their best work and put more time and energy into their project. Teachers should support the idea of student-designed summer projects so that they get the most effort out of their students.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests, they would be more enjoyable, and they would show an increase in the effort level of students. If summer projects were student-designed, then students and teachers would have a stronger relationship throughout the remainder of the school year. School systems and teachers should consider assigning student-designed projects over the summer.Â
