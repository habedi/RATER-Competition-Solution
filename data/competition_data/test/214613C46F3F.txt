Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think policy number one is a better solution. Policy one witch allows students to bring their cell phones to school and use them only in free times and at lunch periods, but have to keep their cell phones off during class time. I support policy number one because as being in eighth grade, most students our age have cell phones that play a pretty big role in our lives because we use them a lot. I also recommend policy one because I myself does have a cell phone and I always like talking and texting my friends to find out the latest news.

I could also see where policy number two could come into play because unfortunately we have students in our grade that would abuse the rule. Some students would not go by the limitations if we were in fact given the freedom to use our cell phones in our free time. Also, some teens in our grade would take advantage of the rule and use the cell phone to spread bad gossip and do wrong things such as cheat on tests.

I think that witch policy choose depends on the school and how much the teachers and faculty can trust the students.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
