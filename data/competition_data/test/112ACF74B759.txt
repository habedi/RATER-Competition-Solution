Dear Principle

I STUDENT_NAME, believe that people should be required to perform community service, not just to help the earth, but for many more reasons as well. It would go great for the students high school or maybe even college they might want to attend. This is also a great opportunity for your students to learn how to clean up after themselves and sometimes for others. This activity will give students the courage to be independent for themselves. to help them learn it's ok to help out and not want to play video games repeatedly. Maybe even if some of the students were to participate others will join to help as well. Like I said in the beginning, it can do more than just help the earth it can make the world a better, cleaner, and more reliable place. Why reliable you might ask? Well I will tell you. If the world is more reliable then more people can depend on the earth for less tocsins in the air or for anything not to become air born. People on this earth will see that things will become so much better if you just lend out a helping hand and help us clean OUR earth. Not destroy it, but build it to be a greater place for our next generation. This earth needs our help and without it, it will crumble, fall apart, become a waste land. But we as the people can stop that from happening. All you have to do is say YES to performing community service. So please (PAUSE) say yes. Thank you.
