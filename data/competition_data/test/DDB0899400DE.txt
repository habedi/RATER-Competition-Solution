I just graduaded for high school. I got an opportunity of a lifetime. My friend Don Reist to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn'd say no to him. It was 1945 and world war to in Europe was just over and I wanted to help put it back together.

Many of the countries were left in ruins because of the war. I went to help because I wanted to help with them. Together we made UNRRA and hired seagoing cowboys take care of young and old caddle an the farms to get started with work.

In August 1945 we were sent to New Orleans. We were sent the day the Pacific war ended. I tured 18 before we went to Greece whitch ment I could be drafted to the army. Every one told me just do keep doing my job intil the time comes if it comes.

The cattle trips were hard and long. I saw China and it was cool. The Acropolis in greece was a sight. Most all the streets in Italy were full of water. but I had a good time were ever you put me.

In the end we all tryed to help out other people even if they arnt native to use.
