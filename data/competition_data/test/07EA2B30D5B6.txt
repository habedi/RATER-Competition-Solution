I disagree with the principal's opinion or option because not everyone likes the listed activities or sports, or they maybe might just not do sports at all. It should only be a list of people who are actually willing to participate and follow directions, not just participate because they have to or are being forced to. Sports aren't meant for everyone or you might not just have the ability to do sports, if the students decide to not participate in sports or the other options it shouldn't be a big deal,some may not want to do an extra class. The principal's choice or option really shouldn't be a must. There should be an agreement with students about it and if some agree they should add extra options. not just sports, Work on the year book, Or serve on the Student Council. That is really only three activities and there might be more but not exciting or just not fun to do. That's why it wasn't mentioned and there is a lot of moving in those few options which includes excercising. So therefore I totally disagree with The Principal's opinion or option of making it a Must do. It can affect people's attendance. They could skip that class because Either they hate it, Maybe not their thing or choice, And not just skipping the class. They maybe just won't come to school at all when they have to do the activity they chose. And that's not what the principal is trying to prove or achieve. The Principal wants excercising and moving but students don't. and also aswell complaining. Students may whine a lot to their teacher saying stuff like I don't want to be here or disrespecting The Teacher who gladly decided to help out. So in my opinion I think it's just better to keep it the way it is right now and not add the option of must do sports or the other activities.
