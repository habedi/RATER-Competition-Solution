Dear Principal,

Doing community service is a choice. Some kids want to do it, others think that its stupid. I don't think that there is any reason that you should have to force kids to do it but you should reward them for it. If you reward kids by doing community service say you give them some money it might inspire more kids to help out. This is a great idea because it doesn't force kids to do anything but it gives them a reason to want to help out. A reasonable ratio may be for every 4 hours of community service they get 20 dollars. Maybe a kid might want a new laptop and he's 40 dollars short. He could spend one long day working and he could get enough money to buy that laptop. Its a great and productive way to get kids to help out. Say that 10% of your school does community service now. If we add in the reward we could bump that up to 50%. It would make our town a much better healthier place. You may have noticed the trash on the soccer field behind our school. That could all be cleaned up if you offer this reward to the kids at our school. You could even offer it too adults. If we did that we would be the cleanest, smartest town ever. That definitely appeals to you considering you are the head of a school. You want all of your kids to do as good as good as possible in there school work. Your school could have the best grades in the state. Our town would be so amazing. So you can see how much encouraging kids to do community service is good for our school but forcing them, that's not going to help anything. If you force them to do community service then they wont put all of there effort into it. That could make the town even worse. Kids could start failing school on purpose in retaliation of being forced to do school work.

Thank you for reading my letter.
