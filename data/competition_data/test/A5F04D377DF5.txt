Dear principle,

I as a student will strongly say that we should not have phones at school. The reason I say this is because phones will be too distracting in class. The students will forget to turn off the phones and when somebody send a text message to that person and the phone will ring while we are doing something important. this incident had happen a few times at my school. If we let phones be used in school this will happen even more times then ever. there could be cyber bully send text message of threats like

"

if i don't get my money ill beat you until you're numb " . student could send sexual text message and they can get nude picture to other who seems to get in trouble by teacher. and that person will get suspended from school and many student could flunk if that happens to many time.

that's why I would not allow phones at school
