Dear Principal,

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter i have concerns about the policy you have for sports and extra curriculum. I think the policy you have isn't helping the students because if we want to succeed in sports we have to be able to play them. So i don't think the policy is good because if we don't have players to play then we won't have sports and we won't succeed.

I think if we the policy should stay the same like it was because a C is passing a class. I do understand that you want us to achieve and do our best but not everybody's best is a B average. I think we as students should be giving a chance to prove that we can do our best and our award should be able to play sports. I think if you change the policy more children would be less interested in sports. Also if we wanted to do extra curriculum activities i think we should be able to do it because its helping us in the areas we need help in so it would bring up our grades or help us later on in life. So think about the effect on this policy it could change a lot of things in the school.

Thank you for reading this letter I hope you take it into consideration and remember the effect it has on us as students and the school.
