My principle has decided that she wants everyone to participate in a extracurricular activity. In my opinion, I believe it's the best for students to participate in school activity. It will be a great way to have fun, make new friends, and get some exercise.

Making new friends is not always easy. Many kids now judge you by the way you dress, act or even look. For example, I was a new girl at a school. It wasn't very easy to make any friends so I decided to stay after school and join a club. As I was joining a club, I got paired up with a girl who was in the same grade as me.

At first, it was awkward but then we started conversations and we found many things in common. One thing that we found in common was that we both love dancing. Since then, we have been very close friends until this day. Participating in a activity was the best thing I did to be able to make new friends from a new school.

Another reason why students should join a activity is to maintain your health. According to WWW.stay. healthy. com, has stated that participating in a club or activity at least an hour per day is very important for your health. It is also a great way to distract yourself from any anxiety or stress you are facing. Everyday my sister would come home from school. She would always be overwhelmed with the amount of homework she had to do and complain about how much her neck and back was hurting. It was a hard time she was facing and my mom decided to take her to the doctors. Our Doctor, said that her body was hurting because she didn't get any excersice and she also wasn't participating in any activity to distract her. The next day, my sister decided to try out for volleyball. She was great and made the team. By joining volleyball, it helped her feel free because she was distracted by everything negative she was facing.

Joining a activity doesn't have to be boring or all about running . Activities are meant for you to pick them and do something fun you love. There are many activities to choose from. For example, I love doing pottery. My mom and I would go to a building where they would teach you how to make cups, any animal, and vases. It makes your hands messy but it was so much fun. Next year, for high school there is a class where anyone can take and it is called ceramics. I am beyond excited to take a class where I'm going to do something that will distract me but at the same time I will be doing something that is fun for me. When given the chance to participate in any activity, it is a great way to pick something you know will be enjoyable.

As a result, by participating in a activity it helps you maintain your health, have fun, and meet new people. At first, starting something new can take a couple tries until you get it right. In addition, once you learn it is the best feeling ever to accomplish something new. After learning it will become easy and fun because you will already know what to do.

It is also a great way to meet new people and make friends who love the same thing you do. Activities help you feel distracted and calm because you are doing something you love and no one is judging you from it. These are my reasons on why I strongly believe that everyone should participate in a extracurricular activity.
