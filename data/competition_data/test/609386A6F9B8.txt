The Face was not created by aliens because it is probably just a shadow. It also looks ,in height wise, like a lava dome in Idaho. Lastly, their camera would have caught any glimpse of alien markings. These statements are valid because looking at the evidence provided it gives you more facts that any skeptic could.

The passage states that the Face is just the shadow of where the camera was, then creating the affect of the eyes, nose, and mouth that you see in the pictures. It is more than likely just a groovy landform created on the surface of Mars.

It also states that in the Middle of Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho there is a lava dome, and it is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Which is meaning that if there is a landform on the Earth that resembles the Face, then the Face is a natural landform.

Skeptics state that when the scientists tried to get another picture it was very foggy, and that the "ailien markings" were hidden by a haze of fog. That is not true because in paragraph 11 they state that they can make a pixel 3 times its size. Hence that if there were alien markings it would have been caught by the camera.

The Face is not an alien marking because it resembles an Earth landform, the face created is just a shadow, and the camera would have caught any alien markings.
