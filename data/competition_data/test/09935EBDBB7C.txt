The concepts our public schools come up with are great and efficient! Schools like to push their students to succeed and to be educated. For this reason, some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure that they retain the material and information they learned during the school year; furthermore, these projects should be teacher-designed. The best reasons that support this claim are that these projects are, in fact, beneficial to a students education as they help them retain information and will help students study, these projects can offer an opportunity for students to earn extra credit the next school year, and because a teacher will know a students academics strengths and weaknesses, a student will not.

Extra credit is something a student may need to graduate, it is something universities look at, and it can bolster a students grade. These teacher-designed summer projects are a great concept to introduce into schools as one of the countless opportunities for students to excel and succeed. A summer project would be a project grade, a grade that can massively improve a students grade. Following after that, their GPA would increase do the positive grade. This is great for students, which is why it is the first reason as to why teachers should design the summer projects rather than students design them.

Secondly, if projects are designed by teachers, they can help teachers understand where their students level of understanding is at. A student completing the project is more than a grade as a teacher can see where a students weaknesses and strengths are. If a teacher can find the material a student does and does not understand, they can reinforce and reteach the student the material in a way that suits the student better. If a student designed their own project, they would not know how to, as they would not know their own weaknesses and strengths as much as a teacher will, making teacher-designed projects during the summer much more efficient.

Thirdly, teacher-designed projects will help students study and retain information; summer vacation is about 2-3 months long, students can forget important information during that time. A project that focuses on the core subject a student was learning will keep the material, information and concepts fresh in that students mind. This is crucial to do, as if the student is unprepared the next school year, they will fall far behind. If a student designed their project to help study, they would make it easier on themselves by not including the material they don't understand so they can learn it. Nobody can learn what they already know, which is why students should not design their own projects and why teachers should design their projects.

However, that's not to say that even with teacher-designed projects there aren't faults. Even with studying and completing a project during the summer, a student can still forget the material. A student may know their own weaknesses and strengths and could be working on their weaknesses. And a teacher may make the decision to not grade the projects at all. That's also including that some teachers may actually tell students to make the project themselves as that allows the student to truly look at what makes the subject difficult for them, it allows the student to learn about the subject, and it helps the student to help the teacher understand what made the subject difficult for them.

In conclusion, its best teachers design summer projects. While students can do it to and learn for themselves, a teacher is more skilled in this area of education and would help a student more than hinder them. A teacher giving extra credit, a project that challenges the student to help them retain the information, and a project that helps the teacher understand a students strengthsÂ and weaknesses is vital to a students success. Therefore, why shouldn't, wouldn't, or can't schools allow teachers to design summer projects for students?
