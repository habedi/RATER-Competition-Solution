Driverless are they going to be part of the future or should they stop trying to make them? Today I'm going to be telling you my opinion on it.

To begin, I don't like the idea of smart cars I believe they're really expensive to make and just recently a driverless smart car ran into a semi. They're not safe and no one wants to spend money on a vehicle they can't drive it's just silly and during the winter they won't know how to handle ice and snow they'd probably spin out and crash and hurt a passanger in it and who's going to get in trouble for the accident? The passenger or the manufacturer? I guarantee you it would be the passenger even though they didn't do anything wrong.

Secondly, a lot of people like/love driving and don't like being passengers. Those people definitley won't buy smart cars they like the feeling of being in control not sitting there watching a car drive them around. It even sounds weird having a car in control. In cities sure they'll work because people use taxis now but think about all the people being layed off because a new type of car took their job! I can't imagine how they would feel. My dad was layed off a few years ago and we struggled getting by and no one should have to go through that especially if they have children.

In conclusion, I believe driverless cars/smart cars are going to cause more problems then they'll fix. I am against driverless cars. Are you against them too?
