In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think using the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read students' emotional expressions in a classroom. I think this because if a student is bored or tired, you can tell just by their face on how they feel. Also, this new technology system could help humans learn how to use their muscles in order to make them smile again. In the next two paragraphs, I will explain using eveidence from this article on how this is true.

Using the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System shows how you feel just by the look on your face. In paragraph 5 it states "In face, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look her on face... Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions... His new computer software update stores similar anatomical information as electronic code." This statement from the text is saying how humans show emotions just by their face. This detail states how using the new technology shows us more on how a person is feeling.

The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System also shows humans on how to learn to move their facial muscles. In paragraph 9 it states "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help you produce them... Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions." This is stating that if you use your facial muscles, you can actually start to feel slightly happy. This detail explains how using your facial expressions can actually make you feel slightly happy.

In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," this new technology the Facial Action Coding System is valuable with students in a classroom. We can tell by students' faces on how they feel, but the new technology helps us figure out their emotions even more. The technology is a very good use if you want to figure out someone's emotions. This can also help students realize what they actually feel and start moving their facial muscles to make them feel slightly happy again. The more you move your facial muscles the slightly happier you will get!
