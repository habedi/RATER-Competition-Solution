Do you know how your parents tell you it's for the best? Maybe the principal is doing the same, by making you do at least one extracurricular activity. This idea keeps you and some of your classmates out of trouble, also it helps you meet new people, and you can find something that interests you.

First, this keeps you and some of your classmates out of trouble. When there at an extracurricular activity there somewhere good instead of somewhere bad. Like in the movie Brian Banks, if he was at football practice instead of with the girl he would've never went to jail. The people your hanging around in your activity are going to be good people, so you don't get drawn into the badness. Instead of going to detention your in your activity so you keep out of trouble.

Next, you get to meet new people. If you're shy than this is an opportunity for you to make new friends. You can also meet somebody that is good in a class that you're not good in. For example, say that you're having trouble with writing and you you meet somebody that has an A in writing, you can ask them for help so you can have an A in writing also.

Finally, you can find something you may be interested in. If you go into an activity that you've never done before you might come out of it wanting to come back to it the next day. Also, you may find a job that you're interested in related to the activity you did. For instance, if you do pictures for the yearbook then when you got older you might want to be a photographer.

In conclusion, the idea for everyone to participate in a extracurricular activity is a good idea. It keeps you and some of your classmates out of trouble, you get to meet new people, and it helps you find something you're interested in.
