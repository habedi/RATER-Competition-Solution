Dear principal

I know that phone are a problem now days because student that bring phones to school are tempter to start texting in school and i think that policy 2 is a very good idea because if srudents are banned from bringing phones to school it will help not only you from taking them away ,but it will also benefit them too because I think it will also benefit them to because they will pay more attention to the class but they will also help them learn better but it will remove unecicary stress

Paying attention in class is hard but it becomes harder when your doing something else like using a phone in class thing is why every year there are more students dropping out from high schools nation wide than ever before . To prevent that in our school i sujest that u pay close attention to that .

Stress. believe it or not a student going to school has more stress than the average adult. having to use a phone with out permission provides more stress then u can believe this is because of being scared of the teacher taking it away

I hope that you have listen to my reasons on why i thing policy 2 why i think that policy 2 is better for our school and everyone in it . thank you for listening to my idea of why i would consider having policy 2.
