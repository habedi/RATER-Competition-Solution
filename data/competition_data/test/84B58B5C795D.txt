Have you ever wanted to know what planets are very close to the earth? well venus is the closet planet to earth in terms of density and size. And occashionally the closet distance. Earth snd venus and mars are our planetary neighbor.

Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has tpuched the planet venus in three decades. A thick atmosphere almost 97 percent caron dioxide blanket venus. As of today Venus has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and creators.

Peering at Venus from a ship orbitin or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography. Researcher cannot take samples of rock, gas or anything else from a distance.

Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

Each misson was unmanned and for good reason. sinnce no spacecrat survived the landing more than a few hours, The venus is also called the evening star. its also one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even a amateur stargazer to spot.
