The author of the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" presents a well written case on why mankind should continue to look for ways to explore Venus. The author presents the article starting off with information on Venus and how its challenges inhibit scientists from exploring it. They present the challenges in an orderly way, how scientists may be able to counter these challenges, and why it is so important to get there.

Getting to Venus will be the easiest part of the task that scientists are faced with. In paragraph 2 the author states "Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus". Getting to Venus is the easiest part of the task, but staying there will be exponentially harder. In paragraph 3 the author presents the many challenges scientists have to face to be able to stay on Venus following the logos method. These include but are not limited to "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide...", "clouds of of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.", and "temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit". That is just the atmosphere, not including Venesian geology and weather.

Despite all these challenges, the author believes scientists should keep trying to study Venus and shows some ways that scientists have already begun to take on the problems presented. In paragraph 5, the author cites NASA's possible solution on how to counter the surface of Venus. NASA wants "scientists to float above the fray" in a "blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape". Despite getting here the author presents another problem in paragraph 6 with scientists getting "only limited insight on ground conditions" because of the dense atmosphere. To counter that problem, the author cites another NASA approach to studying Venus which includes "some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide" and "looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers".

With all these challenges and oftentimes complicated solutions the author supports the idea that through all the trials and errors the payoff would be significant to satisfaction and provoking of human curiosity. In paragraph 4 the author claims "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life". Being able to reach Venus's surface would enable explorers to look for life no matter how big or small and see if it was possible to survive the harsh environment. Even more so, "Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth." which would help scientists to determine how Venus was formed. The author appeals to pathos in paragraph 8 stating "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation". The author wants the reader to understand that mankind as a whole should not shy away from the challenges presented no matter how dire the situation and should face it head on, if for no reason other than the question "Can we do it?".

The author presents their information in an orderly fashion, makes their article easy and clean to read, and appeals to pathos and logos. They go in-depth on the situation, the solution, and why mankind should worry about it in the first place. All in all it is a quick and concise article that was well done and well supported.
