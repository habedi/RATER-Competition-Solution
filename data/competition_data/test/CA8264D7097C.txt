In "The challenge of Exploring Venus" Venus is also known as "Evening Star". Venus is one of the brightest points in the sky at night. It is also the second closest planet to Earth,that's why we can see it at night. Mars is also close to us but only at certain times, it all depends on speed otherwise how fast it orbits around us. The atmosphere on Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide which means there's no air, the clouds are made of corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperature is over 800 degrees fehrenheit.

The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater, so if we were to send any type if mechanical transportation over there, it would into liquid as soon as it gets there. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other plant in our solar system. Venusian geology says that their are additional impediments the erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes. That means their are multiple natural disasters going on at the same time. Astronomers think that long age, Venus was like our planet (Earth).

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment like mountains, craters and valleys.

NASA thinks that they could put a blimp or some kind of futuristic jet airplanes in outerspace. In the article, NASA was talking about electronics made of "silicon carbide". If NASA could add silicon carbide to a jetplane and some how remote control the aircraft, it might work. I noticed how the author capitalized the "Venus, NASA, Earth, and all the other planets. Also I saw how the author punctuated and put a comma in between sentences to take a breath when speaking. I liked how he put a lot of detail into what NASA thought they should do. I read how they planned out what kinds of tranportations they could send to Venus. They even tested the conditions with certain matierials and objects.
