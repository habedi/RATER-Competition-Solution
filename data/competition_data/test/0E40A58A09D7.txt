Dear Principal,

I think that you probably should not make students that do not want to, do community service. Some reasons are that they have sports and don't have time to spend inbetween their extracurricular activities and their schoolwork. They will, eventually, fall behind in school and will have to quit sports. They will work on their schoolwork, community service, and getting their grades up, instead of doing what they love. So, should you force students to do community service? I think not and here are three reasons why: they don't have the time, they want to spend time with their family, and they might feel like they don't have any rights.

Some kids lead very busy lives, in between schoolwork, family, friends, sports, debate teams, and so on, and so on, but kids do not really know how to distance their activities.

So if you force kids who don't want to do these things and they already have to much to chew, then eventually, they will have to give up something important to them in order to be able to complete the task that has been shoved down their throats. They will become stressed and will start to fall behind
