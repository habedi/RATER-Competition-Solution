In my opinion, I think that is a good program for students. This program have a good benefit for stdents and people that don't have time for go to school. For example, some students that coming form another country they don't have time for go to school to learn English or for go like normal student to the school. I agree that some schools have this good program for students.

My firts reason, I agree with this program because, some students they can lear thing standing in home. For example they learn English, spanish, and franch or another thinf like " How I can complete an application for work."

And all this the students can learn standing in home.

My second reason, I agree with this program because, the stundent that will get this program they can dicided the time for take this classes online. Also the students can decided the day that they want to take this classes. Another, is that no only students can take this program also this program help people that never go to the school before and now with this program this people have the opportunity to learn something.

Some people are disagree with me. Becuase they think that if the student don't go to the school. they don't go to find another opportunity to lear. Another, is that they think is that teh internet is not a good place for learn thing.

In coclusion, this program is a good opportunity for students and people that want to learn standing in home.
