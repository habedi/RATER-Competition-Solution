Cars are useful tools for getting around, but can they harm the environment? Foreign countries in Europe and in South America have started to have major cutbacks on cars. They are trying to limit the amount of smog they have in the cities. Places like Germany, Colombia, and France as well as the United States of America have started to decrease the amount of driving. People in small towns like in Europe should not really need cars, because everything is within walking distance. However, cities in America, definetly need cars to get around. America was built off of cars and long distance transportation. That's why there are tons of roads and highways and large towns and cities. It's ok for smaller towns to cutback on their car usage. Cars can have a negative affect on the environment and limiting car usage is a good way to cut back on environmental endangerment.

Limiting car usage is a good way to save the environment. In Vauban, Germany, the people are already going "car-free". 70% of the town's population do not own cars. David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America says "'All of our development since World War II has been centred on the car, and that will have to change"', "'How much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.'" (Source 1). In France, smog from gas emmissions of cars have been abundant. The government limited the amount of people driving by saying the even numbered license plates are not allowed to be on the road that day, and then the odd the next day. Many were fined for non compliance. "Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog... [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world". (Source 2) Diesel fuel was to blame for this because diesels make up about 67% of France. In the capital of Colombia they have A Day Without Cars. Violators faced $25 charges. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states "'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"'(Source 3). Bogota has about 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most in Latin America. Many countries around the world have started to lowerÂ  the car usage. America is slowly starting to shift, but it will be a long and treacherous journey to completely rid the world of cars.

Limiting car usage in the world can benefit the environment. It decrease fuel emmissions and can limit smog. It also decreases stress and air pollution. Many countries around the world are starting to limit there car usage. They have started doing things like Days Without Cars. Some have even quit using cars completely. It is easier for people who live in smaller towns and cities to do this, because everything is within walking distance. It will be harder to get America to make this shift, because this nation was built off of cars. Our entire geography is based off of the automobile. In order to limit cars and in turn save the environment, America will need to change severely.
