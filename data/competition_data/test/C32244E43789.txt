Dear,Mr. Principal

Mr. Princical I do not agre with your decition to make all students do a extracurricular activitys and I am going to give you a few reasons why I personaly think so I would apreaciate if you reconsider after you read my reasons.

First Some students do Sports or other activities out of school like Hockey, Foot Ball, or even Boy Scouts for a local team or troop. And adding a extracurricular activity and homework it would be kaous, and dont even get me started on how exzosted students would be. For example My oldest sister, Lindsay who did more than one Extracurricular Acitivitys like Chearleading, Swim, and Archery had her grades go down which leades me to my second reason Grades.

Some students such as my self have end up not doing very well in school when we do a extracurruclar acitivity and a second one outside of school such as the ones I did Foot Ball, Archery, and Boy Scouts which is very hard to do when you add homework to it and you want to do good at the sports that you do aswell trust me it is very hard.

Next reason I have is what if you are injured or disabaled and don't plan on doing year book after doing a difrent acitivity earlearer in the year with all the frends that you had made while doing the acitivity with them and yet you would have to leave them just because you had broken a bone or sprained your arm or leg because you would have to do an Extracurricular Acitivity because that is the school rule.

So bacicley what I am trying to say is that it might not be the best idea to make every student do a extra curicular acitivity due to all the reasonsi have and the many reasons that my fellow students have as well so i would apreaciate it if you would re consider
