Many schools around the world provide students with the option of attending a class through a video call or online.

Some people might argue that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes at home, however it is clear for many reasons that being able to attend a class from home is indeed very beneficial for students

Personally I see this way of learning beneficial because of times I was not able to attend school. I had gotten sick about a week ago and missed two days of school. This resulted in me missing out on eight class periods and stressing out over the work I had to make up. If the school I attend had a means of learning from home, such as online classes or video conferences, It would have made the situation much easier for me and many other students who I am sure have been in the same situation.

On top of that, having online classes would also most likely result in a shorter school year. Some days a school is required to close for the safety of its students. This results in thousands of students missing out on their education for possibly weeks at a time, because of this the school has to extend the school year in order to make up those missed day. A perfect example of a school properly prepare to close would be what Generic_School is doing right now. Although they do not offer online classes in place of regular ones they are preparing to do so in response the corona virus. This means if the schools have to close students will not miss out on valuable information.

Still some might argue against the implication of online courses in schools. They view learning from home in a negative light because it takes away from the experience of working with other students, however this is not the case. With modern technology there are countless ways for students to communicate and work together to solve problems.

There are many examples that would show how students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home.

Such as shorter school years and not missing out on an education and still many more reasons not brought up in this essay.
