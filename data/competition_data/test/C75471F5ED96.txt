Summer projects allow students to have the opportunity to learn while they are not in school and it can benefit them in many ways. Summer projects should be designed by students because it gives students the opportunity to learn more about something of their choice, it shows that they have a connection with the project, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things.

Students should be given the opportunity to create a project about something of their choice. It gives them independence and the ability to rely on themselves. It is good to give students independence starting at a young age because it allows them to be self reliant. Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic. Teachers love when a student creates a well designed and well thought out project. If a student were to be given a project designed by the teacher, the student would feel like they couldn't do much with it because they have no connection with it. When students have a connection with something it makes them feel more enthusiastic about the project or assignment given to them.

Students are more eager to learn about new things after they researched something of their choice. When students have a choice, they would rather research something that they don't know too much about. After that topic is researched they feel enlightened. Students also tend to branch off of the topic that they first researched as well. This technique is often used by students because it makes research easier for them and they like to make things easier for them rather than harder.

In conclusion, Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it gives them new opportunities, it shows that they can connect to something, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things. Although teachers can provide students with a base and a template for their project, it would be best and beneficial for students to be able to create and think of something on their own. Students are more prepared for college and high up positions in life when they are given the opportunity to create something of their own. It allows students to have independence and other useful tools for their future.
