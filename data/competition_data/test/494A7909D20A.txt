Have you ever looked at a freind and have no clue what he or she is feeling? well with the new invention the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) could tell what your freind is feeling just by reading their face.

I think the technology of having a divice that could read a human emotions is a impressive and could be valuable.

One reason why I think the FACS is a good thing is because it would be great for the cosulasr at the school that could help ceritain kids out if they are feeling low, depressed, sad and any other negitive feelings. a sentence from paragraph 3 says "Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear , and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscels."

Another reason why i think FACS is a good thing for studenst in the class room is it could read the studnce and if the student is having trouble or confused , the FACS could see it and make the assiment less difficult for the student wich would help alot, I thought this because in the text it says , " A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confusd or bored, Dr. Hang predicts. " then it could modifiy the lesson, like an effective human instructor" this shows that it could be useful for students .

Thses are some reason of why i belive that the FACS is a good thing for students at school .
