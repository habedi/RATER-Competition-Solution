Luke's point of veiw of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that being a Seagoing Cowboy is awsome/cool and it's an opportunity of a lifetime. It made him think about all the people in other countries that are fortunite and unfortunite and their needs. Plus when he was 18 he could of been drafted for the military service but when him draft boat learned he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. And by the time i was discharged in 1947, I made nine trips-most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Besides the cattle-boat trips were unbelievable, cause i got to help people like; I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. But what kept me busy was caring for the animals during the crossings. They had to be fedand watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out at my aunt Katie's farm had prepared me for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On my second trip I served as night watchmen. My job was to check on all the animalsevery hour. But one night after my hourly checkup I slipped on a ladder and almost fell into the dark Atlantic, luckily a small strip of metal along the edge stopped me from falling. But I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. When us Segoing Cowbays got boared when we had to return the animals I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,and games also helped pass the time. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more then just a adventuere, it opened up the world to me. And I'm grateful for this opportunity. And that awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a umber of international students and exchange visitors for many year. And thats my point of veiw of me being Luke and being a Seagoing Cowboy.
