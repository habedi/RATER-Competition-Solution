In school students are never really given an opportunity to show what they actually know. People learn in different ways and often are not able to let it be known how capable they are. Some students have book smarts but others are just as smart in their own way with a different outlook on life. Students tend to thrive outside of school, especially during the summer. Our knowledge expands beyond the classroom to things we will actually use and need to know during our lifetime. Students designing their own projects can allow their creativity to flow decreasing their stress, which can ultimitely be an easier and more effective learning experience.

For instance, students get to be creative. Over break we learn about ourselves and the world around us. What we learn is not always educational based, but opens us up to a broader perspective of knowledge. If students designed their our pojects they will have a chance to show that they know more than just science and math. On the trips I have been on I have learned things that appeal to me more than what I have been taught in school. Being at a historic site gives a different feeling than just reading 40 pages in a text book over night and being quizzed the next day. During summer, we bloom into new versions of ourselves as we learn and grow older. Students desinging their own projects will allow them to show how they have grown what they have learned about themself and their surroundings. Being about to do work about a topic that excites you drives you to be more creative and productive. Giving students the chance to be creative will leave them forever inspired and thankful.

In continuation, students stress will decrease. Like myself, I know many other perfectionists that get frustrated when not being able to do something the exact way it is intented. Even though I am cautious with how precise I am, teachers can be very demanding. Teachers will take off points for how you word things, how long it takes you to do work, and many other reasons that freak students out. My nineth grade year, my teacher would give us two packets of work and some worksheets and expect them to be done in class. Since it was my first year in highshool I was completely overwhelmed. Since then the work and stress have continued to build up. Each night I have hours of homework to fit in with my life scheduele and i have to come to school ready to work nonstop. Sometimes it does not feel like I am learning anymore just simply trying to pass. We spend the majority of our year learning and following everything our teachers say. During break is when we get to be free and live our lives. Students should deisgn their own projects so they are not overworked by teachers when they could be living life to the fullest.

Finally, it can be an easier and more effective learning experience. Some students are failing classes but not because they are dumb, just because they have different ways of learning. Throughout school we pray to get teachers who are not rude and will actually teach us. Every once in a while we are that lucky. Teachers just yell and complain but do not put forth the effort to improve their teaching styles. Kids are constantly sent out of my classes because they were randomly called on and did not know the answer. When taking tests or doing classwork and homework we are not taught or able to review anything but we are scolded for not knowing how to do it. Providing students with the opportunity to do their own projects can be smoother than teachers giving out insane expectations. Students will have the chance to do something that they know while giving teachers an insight to what they actually do know outside of the classroom. Often during projects students are faced with unfair circumstances; usually not having electronics or internet. Students are told to figure it out but they truly just do not have a way to get it done. Students will be able to work with what hey have without too much dificulties. This also gives a chance for students to use the life lessons we are taught outside of school which will benefit the students and the teachers.

In summary, student desined projects can be beneficial by allowing them to express themselves in their own way, decreasing their stress, and being a smoother experience. Students are already expected to amount to high standards and by letting them choose their own projects they will have a better time doing the work. Some say that teachers creating the projects is best because the students will not do the work, but what they have not considered that students give up on assignments because of the fact that the teachers deigned it, knowing it will be overwhelming and stresful for them. Their are usually students who do not care to do any work at all but you can help descrease this by letting the students have their freedom.Â
