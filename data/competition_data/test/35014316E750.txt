Dear Principle,

I agree with your idea to keep students from playing sports unless they have a grade B average or higher. This idea, if carried through, will have a positive effect on the school for many reasons. These reasons include more discipline, and higher academic performance. Please make your idea a fact, and do not let students play sports unless they have at least a B grade.

Though the connection isn't as obvious as other reasons, student's discipline will in fact be improved. Students will want to pay more attention to their teachers so that they will get the higher grade and in turn, play sports. The fact is, that learning comes from listening. They couldn't get a higher grade if they did not learn. Also, students will be less inclined to act up. When a student distracts the class, nothing is being learned. Grades will have no chance to go up. The thought of not being able to play on the sports team is a great persuasion to many people. Finally, it is common knowledge that boys in middle and high schools are more likely to be "cool" if they participate in sports. Other students are always trying to mirror the popular people in hopes of becoming popular as well. If they suddenly see the popular kids listening and being good in school, it is likely that they will also copy that.

Higher academic performance should be strived for in all schools, but unfortunately, there will always be those few "bad apples" that can spoil the bunch. But there is always some sport that will interest people. Even those "bad apples". If they suddenly can't play there favorite sport anymore, then they will be prone to do almost whatever it takes to get back in. Even raise their grades. Secondly, sports can clash with homework. If a student that plays sports can not get their homework done after practice, then they have to make time. School can't be cut out, so sports must go for them. Playing on a team is a privileged, not a requirement. Finally, I have already said in my second paragraph that people try to copy the cool kids. That means that not only are the people who want to play sports going to get better grades, but so are the people who copy them.

Please make it so, and do not let any people who have lower than a B average play sports. My reasons are higher discipline in your school, and higher academic performance. Nothing negative could come out of this. Only something greatly positive. I am a student, and I support your idea. More students support me.
