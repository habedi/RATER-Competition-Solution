Dear. principal;

we do not like the change that there should be a requirement that you should have a B average grade to play sports because not as many people will be on the teams because some have C average grades and will not be able to pay any sports or activities. The teams will not be as good because some of the good players will not be able to play and there you will lose more games than you would if you had those players back. Also a C average grade is passing and you will still go to the next grade. Some students would probably go to a different school so they would be able to play sports then more people will leave because they whant to be with there friends then you will not have as many students as you used too. If you keep it that those people can play sports then that will make students happier and not transfer schools. So please keep it at it is so we can still have good teams.
