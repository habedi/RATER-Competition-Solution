Luke Bomberger had his life changed for the better when he joined the Seagoing Cowboys. He had the pleasure of exploring the world and helping many nations in need. You could help the world too if you helped out the cowboys.

Luke shows that you have the chance to explore new places and meet new people when you are helping this cause. Luke got to travel all the way to China and he explored Venice, Italy. Luke also had the privelege of playing tournaments and various games on board of the cattle boat with his colleagues. You could make new friends and lend a helping hand with UNRAA.

One of the hardships of being a Seagoing Cowboy is having to take care of livestock. Luke provides information that it takes alot of hard work to maintain these animals. Some of the jobs that have to be done include cleaning pens, feeding the livestock, and getting them water. Even though this all seems like too much work, it still pays off with having the feeling of knowing you helped someone's life.

A final reason that you should join this program is that it shows hope that the world could be a better place for every nation. These people are helping provide food to citizens' lives who were affected by war. This shows a ray of sun shine to people who aren't lucky enough to have a home or food. It shows these people that they will be helped. If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you could make someone out there feel like this.

The cowboys out on the sea are helping lives become better out in the harsh world. They are providing food for the hungry, and they are making miserable lives great. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
