Citizens who own a car should listen closely to the advatages of limiting your car usage. Even if you do not own a car you should listen to this. The usage of cars in big cities have always been a problem to our enviroment but now pollution is at an all time high in the world. Officals have said cars are one of our biggest problems of greenhouse gas emissions.

Not using your car can benefit in your health more than you think too. Like the capital city of Colombia, Bogota, car owners should try the program they did. Columbians used every other use of transportation, like walking, biking, roller skating, or used the city buses to get to their work place. This day was know as the car free day. The program they used was already spreading to other countries but after Colombia did, many other countries started to fallow.

Car owners who do not use their car very much, tend to have a healthier life style than most. They begin to walk, bike, or go to the local bus stop to get to work. Those who do not use their vehicle not only have a healthy life, but they also have more money saved so that they can invest into something better. For example a better house, being able to support their children easier when it comes to school or sports, or they might even have a little extra cash to be able to spend when they want to buy something for themselves.

If the enivroment had a mind of its own, I am sure they would apprecate the things you have done by stopping the use of your car. These may not be all of the advantages to not using your care but these are some that can at least start you off on the right track.
