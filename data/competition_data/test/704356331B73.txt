If you think the Face on Mars was created by aliens, you're out of your mind. Aliens didn't create the Face, it's just a huge rock formation. In fact, the Face is just a natural landform.

The Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face.

The picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Garvin says it's about the same height as the Face on Mars, which shows that the Face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte.

When the picture of the Face was posted on a JPL web site, it revealed a natural landform. Many people believed there was no alien monument after all.

So in conclusion, there are many reasons why the Face is a natural landform. The theory of the Face being created by aliens is inaccurate.
