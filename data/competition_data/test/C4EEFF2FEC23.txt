In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author believes that Venus is worthy of human research and time although the task poses multiple dangers. I stand by the authors claim because we would gain information on how our universe works, and how it was many millions of years ago. The article states that although Venus is sometimes "around the corner", humans have sent many unmanned spacecrafts to attempt to explore and learn about Venus as a planet. Those spacecraft have not survived landing for more than a couple of hours. This has discouraged humans enough that we have yet to send another spacecraft to Venus in over three decades.

The challenges are very rough and will not be anywhere close to a easy task. First they have to get through a thick atmosphere almost consisting of 97% carbon dioxide. After the atmosphere, you will have to survive the clouds which consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Then you would need to figure out how to help deal with its average surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system.

Next, you'll have to create something sturdy enough to withstand its atmospheric pressure which amost 90 times geater than Earth's. The geolocial features and weather such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes will also aid in ruining the journey.

If we can overcome these obsticles we could learn much more about Venus's past, present, and future. The more knowledge we have will help to futher even more research and hopefully explore even more in our universe.
