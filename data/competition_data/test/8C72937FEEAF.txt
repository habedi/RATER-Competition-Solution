I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. I feel like its a good way because it uses a 3-D comuter model. It will show you the different ads depending on your muscles in your face.

The reason why I am for it is because" the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles." The second reason is because "...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow. But if you frown,the next ad will be different." This proves that the ads will change because of your face expresstion.

I feel like this is a good way to know other peoples face expresstion so that way if you don't know if your friend or family member is mad,sad,happy,surprise,etc. Then they can use the Facial Action Coding Stystem so it will tell you if they are okay or not and if they need to talk to you than they can. Its also a great way for them to tell the difference between different expresstion. So when they get older they can know exactly what face expresstion they are using.
