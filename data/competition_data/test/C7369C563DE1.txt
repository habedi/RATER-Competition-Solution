I think that self-driving cars can be a good and a bad thing. They can make driving safer, but they can also make it more dangerous.

I am in favor of self-driving cars if the problems can be corrected. So far the cars being made by Google are not completely self-driven. There still has to be a driver behind the wheel to take control when needed. A self-driven transportation system would be beneficial to people who need to be taken somewhere. It would be a great improvement. It would help in an emergency situation, such as if someone is injured, they are alone and cannot drive, the car can pick them up and get them medical care.

The self-driving cars also would improve the economy by reducing gas milage. The cars do not take up as much gas as other cars. The improved economy would allow for more money to be put into important projects that can benefit people and improve the world. The car sensors would also reduce the number of accidents. If people don't get into car crashes or accidents, there are no medical bills to pay, leaving more money for the driver for important exspenses.

People having more money can lead to a better life, such as paying for college, or a new home.

The self-driving cars are our key to the future, a better world. The cars improve life by saving money and by not using as much gas, reducing pollution, providing better air to breathe. There needs to be more research done to complete a fully-automated car, this new transportantion system needs to be put into place as soon as more can be done to fix the issues the cars are having. So in conclusion, The sooner the problems are fixed and the cars are being produced, the better life people will have thanks to driverless cars.
