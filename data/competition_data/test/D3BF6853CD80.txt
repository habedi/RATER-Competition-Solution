This is why you should join the seagoing cowboys,you get to travel over seas like the atlantic ocean, its also a great way to travel to new contries and see how they live and see there needs to,its also a great way to get out a see the world you get to see cool stuff and experince cool stuff to it said in the story that by the time luck was 18 he had traveld more then anyother seagoing cowboy thats really cool.

Hes still young and hes traveld alot being a seagoing cowboy is awsome and if you try it you will probably love it beacuse for luck being a sea cowboy was much more than an adventure it opened up a whole new world for him he said im grateful for the oppertunitys i have had it made me more awar of the contries and people all around me and those peoples awarness stayed with him leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

If you become a seagoing cowboy can sometimes lead to bad things like when luck slide on the ship and almost fell of the boat but then was caught by a rope that caught his fall so he was happy to still be alive and happy that he didnt go in to the atlantic ocean and when your on board its sometimes really fun especially on return trips when the animals got unloaded the cowboys play baseball and volley ball games in the empty place that the animals ounce were tabel tenniss,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling and games helped pass the time when the animals were gone.

So that is why i think that you should sighn up to be a seagoing cowboy becuse its fun and u get to see things you might never get a chance to ever see again and you get to see animals and play games and have fun hope you join.
