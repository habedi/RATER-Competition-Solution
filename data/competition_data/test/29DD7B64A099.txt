Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think all students should take some time out for community service. I know students who are teenagers don't think its a great idea, because they have so many activities going on in there everyday life. Instead, just think about when you're driving down the road and there is trash everywhere doesn't it look unhealthy for the environment? What about the animals who live in these woods don't you think they would like for this trash to be gone? If all students were to pitch in a little time to do community service our town would look great! To make it easier on people we could have schedules for everyone in the grades 9th through 12th. The ninth grade could do community service on Monday after school, tenth on Tuesday, eleventh on Wednesday, twelfth on Thursday, and every grade on Friday. Just a couple hours everyday will make this trash go away!

I hope you will accept this letter from me and use it for our community.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
