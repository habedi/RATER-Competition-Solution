The claim for my draft will be about i agree on it. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Using video imagery the new emotion- recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painting face of Mona Lisa. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day.

For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows-feet around your eyes. My evidence is in the text. We have thing mostly like this because we have videos, phones ,and other things it would be different if they would bring this to market but there would be tons of compention. Sum it up we have cameras we have stuff that helps up with every day life i just dont think that we really need a computer or whatever it is to tell us how were feeling because over time we will just find out on our own.

But there are benifits like if u had a picture of a historic figure like the "Mona Lisa" it would be interresting to see how she was that day was she sad or mad,depressed,lonely. All these things have a effect on us but do we really want a computer to tell us how were feeling
