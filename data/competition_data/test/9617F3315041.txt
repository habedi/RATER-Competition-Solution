Have you every wanted to go visit Venus or just see it through a telascope? Well NASA have been tryign to go and see Venus, and sent robots and other things there to take picture or recording what is going over on the planet. The are a few problems with sending humans to Venus and things could go wrong if we are not prepared to go there. But here is a few problem with sending humans there.

Venus is very common to earth and some call it our sister. It will be very hard to try to have humans walk on planet Venus. In the text it says that "On the planet sruface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenhit, and the atmospheric, pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet". That means it is going to very hard to withstand the temperature on Venus surface.

Another problem is that in the text it say that " Beyond high presure and heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land." What that mean is that is very challenging to send human on Venus and it could destroy the space ship and other things NASA sends.

Even though Venus has though things as well as earth they both are still very much in common. Studies have shown that Venus has have largely oceans and could have supported life on the planet just like Earth. But still Venus do have some landscape features just like earth. Venus have valleys, mountains, and craters all the same as earth.

Taking a trip to Venus will be a challenge and it will happen some day. NASA will some figure out a way to get there. But Venus is still a little different from earth and dangerous. Venus do have some simliiar like features as earth do. And the planet will remain earths sister.
