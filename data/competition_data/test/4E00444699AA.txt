I am going to tell you why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. There are a lot of reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you like helping people the Seagoing Cowboys program because what they would do is that during World War II they would give some counties that were in World War II food, supplies, animals, and more.

If you want to know the name of the group it is UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabiltation Administration).I know it is long and hard to remeber but if you join for your freetime you can traval to cool places around the world. The best part is that 44 nations will join.

Another reason why you should join the Seragoing Cowboys program if you like animals you should go becase the UNRRA will be sending animals over seas on a boat to counties that are over seas. Second is you want to make freinds when you there cause there are going to have a lot of people that you can make freinds with.

there are a lot of reason but those are all i can think of hopefully you join. So those are some of the reasons that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
