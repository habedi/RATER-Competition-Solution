Dear, Principle

On my behalf I think we should do community services. Cause these kids tend to think they have maides and they dont, and we are the ones who throw the trash all over the grounds we need to stop that. That's very unsanitary for our health and for others. So I think every Saturday all the kids at our school should do community services for 1 hour. I think we need to start this next Saturday at 1:00p. m. and we can stop when we notice that trash not on the floors anymore. After a few weeks they will get tired of this and start treating our school with respect. So! Do you like my plans? Our school need alot of discipline they go learn, and what about the visitors when they look on the outside and come in the school building and see how its looking. They might want to put there kids in another school because i school is unhealthy and that might create termites, roaches, and rats. So we need to get this school together and stop making stupid and redundant mistakes and get self discipline about these students because its like they running the school you not you need to put your feet down and show them who is the boss get mean and OTHER_NAME they go behave that school.
