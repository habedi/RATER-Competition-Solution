I am going to tell you why you should be a seagoing cowboy. It is really esay, it's fun, and you have to be brave. I will tell you why it is all of those things.

It is really easy. What you have to do is get on a boat go to where the tell you to go. Then get the herd on the boat.

Last you take it to where it goses. Then do it all over agin. Plus I did 9 of then.

It was really fun. You get alot of free time on the boat when you are going to get the cadle. On the way back you have to make sure that the cadle dosenet jump overboard. Plus you get to see alot of things.

You have t be really brave. If are not brave then you wodent be abole to get on the boat. You have to be brave and keep the cadle onboard. You have to be far away from your freinds and family. You have to be brave and ride on a boat all the away around the world. lastly the boat might crash.

Those are just some things about being a seagoing cowboy. That is why you should be a seagoing cowboy. Maby one day you can be like my.
