Yes I do agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because it will keep them occupied, it will help them be more active, and will help them be more/stay healthy. Those are the reasons why I agree on if students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

My first reason on why I agree all students must participater in at least one extracirricular activity is because it will keep them occupied. It will keep them occupied by letting them stay doing something they are good at, it will never let them die of boredom, and it will follow them throughout their whole life. That was my first reason on if students must participate in at least one extracirricular activity.

My second reason on why I agree all students must participate in at least one extracirrular activity is because it will help them keep healthy. For example, a sport is a extracirricular activty and it could/will keep them healthy. That was my second reason on why students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

My third reason on why I agree all students must participate in at least one extracirricular activity is beacause it will keep the active. It will keep them active by letting them have the freedom to do things like participate in sports, work on school yearbooks or serve on student council. That was my third reaosn on why I think students must participate in a least one extracirricular activity.

So, yes I so agree on if students must participate in at least one extracirricular activity. Because it could keep occupied by letting them stay doing something they are already good at. It could keep them healthy by ,for example, playing a sport which is a extracirricular activity. And it will keep them active by letting them have the freedom to do things that are school related.
