Dear principal,

I believe that the school's cell phone policy should be Policy 2, which does not allow students to have phones at school at all. I am convinced that this should be our policy because if you allow students to roam freely with their phones during lunch periods or any other free times, that student will get distracted and for their next period class they will not be able to focus on the assignments. They will be too busy thinking about their social life and will not pay attention to their teachers, since they will most likely be daydreaming.

Another thing is that students will most likely be using phones during class. They will probably be texting and will not have any time to focus on school. Some students might say that they need to have phones to call their parents to come and get them from any after-school activity, and that's reasonable. But that is the only time that students should have a cell phone with them. There will not be a time that a cell phone should be needed to call a parent during free periods or in class, and even if it is required to call, the student can go to the school's office and call their parent from there.

Students also believe that they need a cell phone because their parent might call them for a family emergency, but their parent can call the school office so that they could tell the student. So, they do not need a cell phone.

Therefore, I believe that students do not need a cell phone during school and they should not have them at school at all. If they need to carry a cell phone, that phone should be kept inside their locker during school hours. The cell phone can only be a distraction to a student and it will certainly not improve grades if they have them.
