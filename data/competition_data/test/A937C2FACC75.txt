Second , I think that you should join the program because you can go on amazing adventures. And you might travel by water day and night. I bet you can even have lots of fun in europe. And by adventures I mean going through the ocean and climbing mountains. When you travel on water you will go on boats and cross oceans."Let us say that you can go to europe to florida to england. Yeah thats how fun it is see that's why should join.

Third, another few reasons you should join is because. You might even see whales, dolphins and fish and I know some people love to eat fish with fishing poles. And you should join because you don't know you might even make new friends. I personally love to fish because you discover new fish and if you want you can eat them. So those are the reasons for you to join this program.
