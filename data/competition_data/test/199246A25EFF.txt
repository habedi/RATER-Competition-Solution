What is your verdict on students no going to school by person but by video calls?

Hello there my name is Generic_Name a resent subject has popped up in the new resent on students who can attend classes from home by online video chat or by video and how does that work for classes yes now a days schools are using "less and less paper everyday" and transfer paper work in to files and programs for students and yes its very adviston and safe for the environment but does it make it better to learn.

Distance Learning

Let's Start off with The Pros and Cons

It will make it easier for students who have social problems or for the students who are too shy

It will help students have fiscal disability or mental disability who need medical treatment like med's or help from a parent or Nears

For students who are out sick or badly injured and need to stay home but having the will to learn the this will help a lot

Students who are out of state and cant get to classes because of family problems but have time

Students who have a part time or full time job that who need the money to live on but have the will to learn and keep up with school and classes

Teachers who have privet problems can set up class work and send it to students

One on one toturals and teaching for the student interndutshon on new subjects you can have international classes and learn new things online extra project that need more time that cant be done in normal school but only online

Now for the negative reasons this will not work

Not showing up to classes at all and not logging in being in the video class but looking at another screen in the computer not paying at actions coming in to the video call when ever and not being on time lack of work copying and pasting will be easier with a different screen

The teacher not know if your cheating on work or tests students who lie and not show up too school or the classes call taking very long brakes playing games or texting extra and still being in the video call and pretend to learn

The benefits and Flaws are pretty much equal but yes Students can abuses and go around it but they many ways to prevent them like putting pass cods or blocking websites or games extra but not all can help but how this will benefit student are for the disabled or the injured mostly but for rear events like a student who want to study from other schools or even international classes that would be a big win for students who dont have the money but that have the will to learn.

But mostly it should be a prevliage to do classes online just for students who have problems but have the will to learn and expanded.

Non-Distance Learning

In simply words going to normal classes and school

Meeting the Prophesiers and classes mate learning in parson and how they teach learning life skills and language skills socializing improving meeting classes mate and one day being you long life friends joining into clubs and after school programs getting privet help life expresses and challenge's programs that is offered to help in the long run like more classes,trips,colleges/unavistys extra growing a persons and not being isolated

The only Negatives part on going to to real school is that it can get challenging and rough but anything then that is fine because that the way of life. Life never get easy but its good how this will show you in school not at home reasons if you did't go to school then when its time to go the the real world it will it you like a tuck and at school you can learn many thing not by the teachers but by class mate and friends and that the beauty of going to school and meeting many different people because everything and every one has a story to tell.

"Can a screen do that?"

So in conclusion with many different opinions my choice is that its

NOT Benefits the students the reasons why is that theres many flaws and down that it doesnt help at all and now a day kids gotten so smart that they can find ways to go around blocks and cods yes it removes the benefit of international classes but that the only thing about it you cant get life expresses but looking at a screen that removes the learning part of life.

Learning in school it the best way why is that because you get too meet others and and make friends maybe even life long friends and how life is for them out there life is never easy and so that will happen in school.

you will hit though rounds in school but if you go though it and pass it that means you getting better and when the day comes when you get on the stage and get that diploma that when you know you made it and your ready for the real world school show you that and give you the expresses you need to live on and that the beauty of it youll never get that type of expressions on a screen.
