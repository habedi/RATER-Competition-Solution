Come with me on an awesome adventure. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. What would you say if one of your friends asked you to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I don't know what you would say, but I would say yes. I think you should say yes too.

I would go because it would be an amazing adventure. You would learn so many things that you would normaly not learn as an average high school student. World War 2 just ended in Europe. You want to see the aftermath of some of the cities are.

Every city that he stopped at, he could go to a cool muesuem or go somewhere amazing in that city. Every 18 year old would rather go to Greece than staying at school working on worksheets. Luke and Don got to take care of animals. They also took care of people who didn't have a lot of advantages.

Wouldn't you want to play some fun sports with you friend. Think about your favorite sport. You could play any of those sports. From baseball to table-tennis. You could have a really fun time. There were more things that they did to pass time. If you were tired you could sit in the shade and read you favorite book that you brought.

This would be somebodys dream to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join the program today. You can also invite one of your friends just like Don Reist did to Luke. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
