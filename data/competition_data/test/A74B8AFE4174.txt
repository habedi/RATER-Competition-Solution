It is finally summer! Students have been released from school and are ready for the joys of this hot, laid back season. However, they must also work on their summer project, which can tend to be slightly irritating, but not if students design their own summer project. Summer projects should be designed by students because it lets the projects be tailored to the students' summers and lets them have some freedom during their vacation.

Firstly, summer projects should be student-designed because they can design them to be tailored to their vacation. For example, if some students are going to travel abroad during vacation, they can design the project to include elements of what they learned while outside of the country, whereas students who stay closer to home can apply their daily life to their project. As a result, students can be assured that they will have something they can use in their project since it's designed to accommodate the variables of students' experiences, which aids to making summer feel laid back.

In addition, student-designed summer projects can let students have some freedom during their vacation. For example, a speech class can choose to write a speech on their summer and what life lessons they learned during it. By doing do, the students can proceed on enjoying their summer and can then spend the final stretch of summer writing their speech. Summer is supposed to be a time away from the stresses of school, so if students can enjoy their summer by having the project designed to be completed at the end of vacation, they can feel more satisfied and theyll be more prepared to get used to completing work once they return to school.

In summary, students can have a far more enjoyable summer project if they design it. They are more beneficial compared to teacher-designed summer projects because students can adjust the project to their situations by making certain criteria open ended and have more freedoms by making the project be non-interferingÂ to their vacation. In the end, students will have a much more satisfactory summer project, which will raise their spirits for future tasks
