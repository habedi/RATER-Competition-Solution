I think you shouldn't let student bring their phones to school. Why student shouldn't be able to bring phones to school is what if you using and you drop it and then you have to buy a new one and your just wasting money. Also, what if someone has a phone that's old and other people have new one that kid could be made fun of because he has a old phone. Also, if someone doesn't have a phone and all his other friends do then he will be sad. Also what if people steal kids phones and then the kids who phones were stolen they will have to buy a new one. If kids see their friends with phones then they will want one and that will make their parents are wasting money buying phones for their kids. And if the parents are buying the phones their kids would want the news phones just to show off and parents would be wasting a lot of money. I think you shouldn't let student bring their phones to school. That's way student shouldn't be able to bring phone to school.
