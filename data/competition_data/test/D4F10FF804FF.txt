Dear TEACHER_NAME:

Are u sure u want kids to be able to use their cell phones? I think that kids should not be allowed to use their cell phones because, many kids don't really follow the rules. They'll still be using their cell phones during class. They wont just use then when they are told they can. they'll rebel using their phones during class.

To begin with, students don't follow the rules. Many kids in school don't pay attention and do what ever they fell like doing. They do a lot of things to just have fun. they don't care what happens.

They do what their friends say and not care what anyone else says.

they would just brake the rules and be using their phones during class.

let me explain further. Kids cheat using their cell phones. During tests they can text their friend aski8ng them for answers. This isn't good because, the teaches won't know what they know and won't be able to help us learn what we need to learn. This is a bad way a life for the students.

lastly, they don't really need their cell phones at school. Kids just use them to talk with their friends. They don't really use them for energies. Cell phone are just toys they use. If cell phones where used for emergencies then it would be different.

overall, kids having cell phones at school isn't necessary. kids can live without having them at school. kids could just wait until they get home to call their friends. Cell phones should be allowed for many other reasons too.

Thank you for your time.

sincerely,
