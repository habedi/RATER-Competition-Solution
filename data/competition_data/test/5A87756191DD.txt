Summer is normally seen as one of the best times for students, because they are out of school. There are some schools that add more for the students while they are out on break, by giving them a summer project. These projects given by teachers should give students some reign over what they do, but teachers should also be in control of designing them so that students know what they have to do. If students get too much freedom over what they are able to do, then they could do something that isn't educational, which isn't the goal of summer projects. Students are also less likely to forget if the teacher is designing them, which means that the students can get them in on time. Teachers designing the projects can also mean that students can get the necessary materials that they might not be able to find on their own. If teachers are giving out summer projects, then they should be designed by the teachers, not the students.

There are some teachers like to give their students freedom over what they do project-wise, but sometimes it's not educational, which is the goal. For example, students that play summer sports might just do a project on that. While it would be educational for someone who is interested in a sport, the person who did the project might not have learned anything. On the other end, students that don't really care about the project could do a project on something they already know about. The point of these projects is to learn something knew that the students could possibly teach others, and if teachers don't design them then the students could blow it off and do something that doesn't help them in any way.

Occasionally, students can be very forgetful, and that can be a problem when it comes to doing summer projects on their break. When it comes to this, teachers can help send out reminders to kids and parents on what they should be doing. Teachers that design the projects can send out reminders on what part they should be working on, and with reminders, students can keep the project in the back of their head. Teachers can also have daily steps that they need to complete so that they won't be as forgetful when it comes to doing them. This can help them remember to work on their project when they need to, where they can keep learning and be sure that they can get the project done on time.

Teachers have access to many different websites and textbooks that can help students out with projects. If the teacher is designing the project, then they can add different websites and where to find textbooks that can help the students out. These students can get quick access to websites and textbooks this way, and they can also email their teacher for any additional information. Going to websites or textbooks on a specific subject can help the students learn something new each day of the summer if they are going at a steady pace. Teachers designing the projects to be this way can really be helpful for the students, and they could possibly help others if other students are struggling to get to the websites or textbooks.

Summer projects are easier designed by teachers than students, because while they might not be as willing to do them, students are more likely to do something more educational if these projects are teacher designed, and they are less likely to forget about them as well as teachers can give out necessary material that the students might need for the projects. While students might not be happy that their summer project is teacher designed, they get to learn new things that could potentially help them in their futures.Â
