Have you ever been through a major change? You probably have and so has Luke Bomberger, he went from being a rootin tootin cowboy to a seagoing cowboy. So, many people like change, some people hate it. In fact I feel that change is good for us, it helps us come 1,000,000,000,000 miles out of our comfort zone. So if I were you I would take as many chances as I could.

For one Bomberger had a blast traveling to many different places, it says in paragraph 5 he toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled the panama canal on his way to China .Crazy amazing, right? He was admiring one place on his way to another. What a lucky guy.

Another thing is Bomberger Got to go places that many people may never go. For example He had been to China, Eastern coast of the US, and Europe. Way farther out of North America then Ill ever be. He was probably millions of miles away from where his comfort zone (his house).

Also just the over-all experience you get when you do or try something new. Bomberger states in paragraph 9 that being a seagoing cowboy was much more fun of an adventure. Its all about the people you share the moment with also, they could make it adventerious, scary, fun, or sad.

But do you see getting pushed of of a 1,000,000,000,000 building (your comfort zone) can be fun, scary, or of course uncomfortable. So next time you want to say no to some thing, take chances and say YES.
