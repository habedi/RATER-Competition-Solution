I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. There can be no possible way for there to be aliens on Mars. In paragraph twelve, Garvin states that the Face on Mars reminds him of a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This Face is unusual, but there are outlines and some other formations on planets that are more different than this. In paragraph seven, on April 5, 1998, there was another Face on Mars. A JPL website revealed that there was no alien monument at all. It was just a natural landform.

Only conspiracy theorists state that aliens made the Face on Mars. They don't have the right technology to state that this theory is actually true. Only NASA has the right technology to research this Face and can tell whether this is true. In paragraph seven, because the other Face on Mars have been proven to actually be a natural landform, what makes the other face any different? Aliens have not been proven real at all. So what makes aliens want to make a face on Mars? Even if aliens were real, they wouldn't make any face on Mars. They would make something more complicated.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not made by any aliens at all. Instead, it is a natural landform that probably was made by an asteroid or a meteor that was floating around in space. In paragraph eleven, it states that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.
