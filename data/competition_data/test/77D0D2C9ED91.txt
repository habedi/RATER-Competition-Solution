Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know that your trying to decide if the students at school should perform community service or not, and I would like to help you decide quicker by giving you some reasons and examples why you should require all the students to perform community service, to get credits before high school and learn how to take a part in helping the community.

To begin on why you should require all the students to perform community service is to help them get credits before they get into high school. I know that the teachers, principal, assistant principals and the rest of the staff at the school loves to see when a students achieve. Everyone at the school has a big part in a student life and a way to help them is to give them a head start. While the other students in high school is trying to get their credits so they can graduate from high school. The new comers which is the 9th graders would have most of their credits in that area and not have to worry about it that much then the 12th graders that can't find a way to do community service.

Another reason why you should require the students to perform community service is to teach them how they can help the community by doing simple things and saving the Earth without having to "Go Green". For example, if the students are sent off to pick up some trash in the sand by the beach , they will learn what the trash can do to the animals if it stays there in the sand. Some of the students might become heartbroken. So next time a student goes to the beach on their own time, they might just pick up a plastic rapper or a glass bottle because they know what those items on the beach can do to a sea creature or animal.

To conclude now you know the reason why should pick yes to require all the students to perform community service, so they receive credits before high school as well as take apart in helping the community.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME (A student from SCHOOL_NAME)
