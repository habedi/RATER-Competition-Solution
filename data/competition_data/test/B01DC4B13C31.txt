No, I don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home because they don't learn anything, and they will be behind from other students.

Students will not learn anything from online classes because they don't take the online classes seriously, and they won't do the homework that the teacher gives them, and they have to pay for the online classes the online classes are expensive,and that would be waste of money. Some people in the Unite States are poor they can't aafford. they can't achieve thier goals because they have to work and study hard to achieve their goals. I think attend classes from school would be good idea not from home.

Students would be behind from other students to attend online classes. For example, one of my freinds her name is Generic_Name she was pregnent, and she decided to attend classes from home, so she starts the online classes , and she told me can not attend everyday at the same time because she has to look after her baby, and do the dishes and do house work, so she has to take all the classes again because she missed most of the classes and she was behind from others. she said will not take the classes online; she will go to school.

Some might say, attending classes from online will help them to work and earn money because some poeple have to work, they need money to pay rent and other bills; however, they can work part time from after school 4 to 5 hours a day, so they don't get tired, and they can make enought money to pay the rent and other bills. They can live paycheck to paycheck untill they graduad. they can work in some places with hight school deploma and they can make good money.

Online classes will not help students to learn because they don't take the online classes seriously, and they will be unsuccessful and failed the class. some people can not afford online classes because it's expensive. They will be behind from other students because of their house work, and they have to work a lot harder if they want to achieve their goals. they can not achive their goal if they didn't attend classes, so thats why, I think they have to attend classes from school. Don't, supoort students to attend classes from home because that would be hard for them to achieve their goals.
