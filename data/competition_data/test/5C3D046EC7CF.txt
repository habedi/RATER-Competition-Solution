Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think you should allow students to bring phones to school only to use on their free time and lunch. Also, its a real good idea for us to have them turned off during class time and some kids already do that now so why not make it official. If and when you decide this it'll seem like you trust your students more, but then again if we don't follow this procedure then yes you should take this privilege away. Kids need their phone for after school activities, like if they play a sport or might even have detention; sometimes the front office wont let us call home for some reason or another. Well I guess at lunch or free time we can do it ourselves, especially for the eighth graders its sort of like getting them ready for high school in another way but a fun lesson. For some reason this year our school seems to be a lot stricter than it was last year, I'm guessing because of the change with principal's but why change the rules. Why not add a new rule, make school exciting and fun but also a great and easy place to learn. On my behalf I ask myself every morning while I'm sitting on the bus "Why do I go to school everyday, if certain things aren't allowed but I think they should be allowed?" We have a real strict dress code, all girl shorts have to go the knee, all shirts have to have sleeves and girls can't even where flip flops! Why?! I like to wake up everyday looking cute even though I'm going to get my education, and then its really messed up to me how if we break this dress code we have to spend the day in ISS, go home, or call home to get another outfit to wear. Why should the school tell me what I'm suppose to wear; they aren't my parents and they sure don't buy any of my clothes that I put on my back. So there for since I can't even have my own dress code to follow I might as well be able to bring my phone to school, to at least text my friends complaining about the dress code or any other rule.
