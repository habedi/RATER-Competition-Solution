Dear Principal,

I think that the new regulation of only being able to participate in sports or other after school activities if you have at least a b average is a good idea. Kids need to get there grades up and in high school you are not allowed to be on a team unless you keep up your grades so teaching them to do that know is a grate idea. That way by the time we get to high school we will be used to that staidly of only being able to do the other activities if we keep our grades up to standard.

Another good thing about this policy is that less kids will be goofing off during class and more will be concentrated on there work and studies so that they will get at least a b average so that they can be able to do the things that they would like. More kids will make principles honor roll or even just honor roll and will be able to take higher classes because they are keeping there grades up.

That will also better prepare us for the rest of our life. When we are looking to go to collage most collages want people with better grades than a c average so because of this rule we will start getting into the habit of getting those good grades and hopefully that will carry on with us threw out high school and even on. Once we go on and get a job we will ( or at least most of us) still have the same work ethic and will work hard and do well. Instead if this was never a rule some of us would have never had to try to get a better than a c average or have a better work ethic.
