Do i think we should use this technology on students? Yes i think we should use this technology on students beacause then you might be able to prent fight suicide and more. Ithink its valuable because, if a student is going through a rough time and you use this program you would be able to fidout whats wrong and try to help them.

The other reason why it would be valuable is beause you can help students with bullyin to help them fom getting hurt and not wanting to continue their education due to mean people and neglagence. On top of that we can find out so much me about ur emotions if we were to san teenage minds going through adolesence because they are hanging constantly.

Therefore scanning our emotions will help us find out so much about the human phycological aspect with our emotions. With emotions once we figure out what makes up emotions we will probably mak a robot that can think and feel like a human.

See now the reason why itwouldnt be a good idea is beause it could stress the kids out and make their time worse in schools and in the public life. If we were to let a computerscan the teenagers emotions they might feel scared uncomfratable nd more and they might not do it.
