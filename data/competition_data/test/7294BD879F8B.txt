Many students enjoy their cell phones in or out of school. I believe that the principal should consider policy one. My first reason i think we should use policy one is because some students may need their cell phones during school hours. The students might need to call their mom or dad to tell them that they do not have practice today. This does happen and if it does, you will need your cell phone to call your parent to arrange after school rides.

My second reason for choosing policy one is that what if a student has an emergency or needs help during school. You cannot always rely on your teacher or an adult to help you with that situation. Another student in your classroom could be bullying you so much that you just cannot take it anymore. Someone could have put gum in your chair where you have it stuck on to your pants now. It would be indeed useful and convenient to have the privilege to use your cell phone during your lunch or free time.

My third reason for believing in the first policy is that what if your mom or dad is sick at home and might need help. Your parent made you go to school telling you that they would be fine, but you worry about them all day while your at school. It would be a good thing if you could call your parent during lunch to check on them to see how they are doing. With the first policy, you could also use your cell phone on your free time. An accident could happen when you are on the playground and you before one can say 'Jack Robinson', you fall in a mud puddle. You will then need your cell phone to call your parent for a change of clothes.

I also believe in the first policy because you should not be allowed to have your cell phones on during class time. I have known some schools who do allow the usage of cell phones while in class, and they do not seem to learn as well as others. Those students seem to get distracted while trying to learn. Having cell phones allowed during class could stress the teacher out because she sees that her students are not listening but instead are too busy on their cell phones texting. It is important for the students to learn what they need to learn without having the distractions of cell phones.

I think it would be silly not to allow cell phones during your lunch or your free time. First, because why not? Second, if they are not in class the cell phones would not be a problem. I surmise that the students of your school will certainly feel pleasure in policy one where the cell phones are allowed, just not during class while your are desperate to learn.
