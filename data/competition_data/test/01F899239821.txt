Cell phones are very dangerous in today's time. Did you know that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction that driving under the influence of alcohol? Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.

To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself.

Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't.

Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call.

That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own.

In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone.
