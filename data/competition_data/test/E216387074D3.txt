In my opinion, no the use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Do I believe computers are smart? Sure. But computers arent as smart as humans. Computers do what us humnas tell them to do. I don't believe they can be so advanced as to be asble to read our emotions.

Humans can't always identify another humans emotions, so how can a computer? There's people out in the world whos regular face looks like they're sad, mad, angry, happy, etc. The computers going to pick up that they're always the same emotion, no mater what the situation. Not only that, but there are tons more emotions then the classified six basic ones. Dr. Paul Eckman's FACS picks us just 6 emotions? If thats the case, the computers missing at least hundred other emtions. What about the other emotions? If someone is concerned, unpleased, or please is the computer going to be able to pick that up?

In the reading it says that Dr. Huang states that "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal." How? Like i said before, computers do what we want them too. So how can they read our face expressions? Point blank, they can't. If the world agrees on using this technology for students in the classroom, its a bad idea.

To start with, is a invasion of privacy. If students dont want the teachers know if they're sad or in fear of something, then the teachers dont need to know. Nor do the other students or memebers of the school. If the teachers want to know if the students are bored, or uninterested the teacher should be able to ask the class 'Are you interested in this topic?" "Is this topic boring you." Not being able to look at a screen and count how many are interested and how many are not

Second off Teachers are here to teach us, not be our parents and have pep talks with us. Is school about socializing and meeting people? Yes, to some extent it is. But school is for learning and preparing us for life out of school. Many schools talk about "Oh, the consulers are here for you if you need to talk." "We want you to come and talk to us if something is wrong." Seriously? That's all wrong. Am I the only kid that had to fill out a "slip" and waited until the consuler got with me? Uh, isnt it suppose to be the other way around? Being able to have a technology that can read the students expressions or emotions isnt right, it's honestly kind of dumb. The computer can pick up the six basic emotions right? So what happens if a students wants to get out of class? Does he or she put on a sad face and when the teacher notices sends them to the office? Kids arent dumb these days. We know how to work around the technology and beat the system.

In my opinion technology is getting out of hand. How long ago was that painting painted? A hundred years ago? I don't know. But how can we be so sure that back then people knew what emotions were? Was Mona Lisa really disgusted? If so, about what? Or was she really fearful? What was she so fearful about? What about being angry? Why was she angry? Why was she 4 emotions all at once? I dont know about you, but i've never had more then 2 emotions i felt at one time.

After reading this article and seeing my opinion it should be clear that i say no to having this in the classroom. I believe that thistechnology about reading emotions, shouldnt have even been invented.
