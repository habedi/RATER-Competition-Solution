I do agree that "Driverless Cars" could be a good thing it is a large step for the human race. It would take technology to a whole other level.

In paragraph 5 it states that "sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine,allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone." Which means or brains or slower then the advanced technolgy that there is to come. Where our human instinct "fight or flight" ,such as panic or shock might accure , a compuer would do as programed to act with no feeling and just steer away from harm.

In California, Nevada, Florida ,and the District of Columbia they have started to allow some working w/ the cars and the Google company is hoping soon more to follow as soon as the cars are more reliably safe.

Automakers are continuing to work out problems abd should have all the problems worked out by 2020 , and they grow closer to the destination everyday.
