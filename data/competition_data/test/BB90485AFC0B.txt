Dealing with the Face and researching it on my own I feel very confident to say that it is not made by aliens. My reasons being that if you see what looks like a face in a wall or maybe even a curtain or something of that sort does it mean that it is created by some alien or another unrealistic being?

In an article I read is said that the scientist believe and then it said that the theorist believe, so my question is, are you going to believe a theorist someone who probably hasn't even seen it in person over someone who has probably examined the face over a thousand times trying to come up with something reasonable and real evidence to give the people. A scientist said that he believed that is was a mesa or a butte. Yes, it is true that the government could be hiding aliens and their having the scientist just say that for there sack, but is it likely, no. The scientist have said that they think they've actually seen it somewhere. So maybe there not lieing and it seriously is just a mesa or a butte.

Garvin, a man who went to go see the face has said "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho" and has also said "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars." Does that seriously sound like he's lieing. Hes actually seen it and studied it and everything, and he has no reason to lie about it. But it is your descion you can believe him or you can believe the theroist. The article I read gave me lots of reasons why it wasn't an alien face that it was just nature being nature and the way the put it was very informative and told me that it was definetly just nature being nature.

While ending this, I would like to say that yes I believe the scientist that the landform looking like a rock was just mesa or a butte, but what do I really know im not a scientist. But still answer the question to yourself do you believe the scientist or do you believe the theoriest.
