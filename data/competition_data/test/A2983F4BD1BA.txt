I think other should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys progam because you can see lots of fun stuff that some of your friends couldn't see. I will give you more infomation about the Seagoing Cowboys program right now.

In the Seagoin Cowboy program you can tralvel all round the world to help countries that were left in ruins, but in the Seagoing Cowboys helps thoes people in that country. But beside all that you could see a country you haven't seen before. You can travel across sea on a boat, and on that boat they played games on it. They played baseball, and volleyball. They played in the empty holds where animals had been placed. They had Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whitting, and games also pass the time. If you like any of that I think you wold like it. Luke Bomberger was part of the Seagoing Cowboys program and "it open the world to him." He side. "It made me more aware of the people of other countries and their need." It could also be a opportunity for you, " a small-town boy" to apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program.
