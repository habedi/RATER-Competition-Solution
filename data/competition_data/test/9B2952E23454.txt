"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."(source 2). Cars have been a great help to people but now their boarding the line of help and hurt. The advantages of limiting car usage almost never end. There's always a way for you to limit your use of your car. It's great for the plant. Also it brings ease to you. Then last is that it brings people together.

To began with is that it's great for there plant. For example in Bogota, Colombia every year for three years they would have a car free day. That is when everyone would leave their cars at home and use a bike or some alternative transportation to get to were they have to be. If you choose to do the opposite then you would be fined a $25 fee for using your car. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This also happens in Paris, were they banned cars because of smog. Even if the fee was $31 dollar Almost 4,ooo drivers were fined.

In addition to that is that it brings ease to you. Stated in the first source, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Heidrun Walter said that. When you don't have to think about any car problem you worry less. Even now there has been a decline in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-old's getting a licenses. It's not a priority anymore. With cars comes worries, and people today don't want any worries.

Last but not last is that it brings people together. Usual when we are driving in our cars we hardly look to see who's driving next to us. But if you take out the cars you can really see wants around you. Meet people while you ride your bicycles. You would see the world in a different way.

In conclusion, limiting cars would benefit you in so many way. One like bringing you closer to the people around you. Also without as many cars it would help the plant. Last it would bring ease to you. Overall the less the cars the better everyone and everything should feel.       Â
