It is not a brilliant idea making driverless cars. Why you may be asking? Well first of all cars would still need a human to drive in case of an emergency. Second, most people including me love to drive. Lastly, it would cost a lot of money trying to built driverless cars and special roads.

If Sergey Brin envisions a future with driverless cars; he should probably save all that in his brain. In my opinion, this would bring a huge debat on saying goodbye to cars and saying hello to driverless cars. I am saying this because I think the world isn't ready (talking about technology of course). Even if they do find out a way in making this project work they would still need a person to be alert at all times for any emergency. Which means that you still would need a driver in a driverless car. Which is absurb because it would all be a waste of money.

The majority of people in this world own a car. That mean's that there is a good chance that they also love driving. Whether it's racing or just simply going to the store. It would be completely boring if we just sat there and having absolutley no control of the car what so ever. Dr. Werner Huber mentions that they are thinking of displaying an entertainment system so the driver wont get bored. So then what's the point of all this?

Lastly i think it would cost a lot of money trying to built these driverless cars and special roads. In the article it mentions that google has already made a car and a road but end up saying that it is not something you can buy at a radio shack. Im guessing it would take forever to built roads.

In conclusion i think it is an absurb idea in making a driverless car. First it would still need a driver to be alert , it would be boring and lastly it would cost a lot of money.
