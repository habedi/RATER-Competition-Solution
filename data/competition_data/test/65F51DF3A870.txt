Recent improvements in technology have allowed education to become more accessible by allowing students to take classes from home. There is an ongoing debate over whether the ability to take classes via video conferencing really benefits students. Those who believe that it does not benefit students argue that taking class through a computer creates distractions for both the student and the class, and that students have more incentive to pay attention in a physical classroom, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, distance learning makes education more convenient, accessible, and safe for many students.

There are many reasons why distance education makes taking classes more convenient, thus making them more likely to be attended. Students who attend remotely would be able to dodge the sometimes complex process of getting to school. Many school districts suffer from a chronic shortage of bus drivers, which necessitatesÂ early routes and crowded buses, neither of which are appealing to students or drivers. Students who elect to learn remotely would be able to get more sleep, while students who choose not to would still benefit due to the decreased load on the transportation system. Remote students would also have additional scheduling flexibility that is not available in the closed-campus setup of many schools. Students who attend physical school are usually not allowed to leave school and come back during lunch and free blocks; however, remote students would likely not have this limitation. Because of this, students would be able to take breaks and recharge between classes. These improvements in convenience could have the benefit of decreasing truancy. It should seem trivial that students are more likely to attend class if it is easier to do so. Truancy is an issue that impacts communities as a whole negatively, and any measure that can be taken to curb it should be taken.

There are many reasons why remote schooling makes education more accessible and safe. Because remote classes are not bound by geography, students could take classes from other schools. Some specialized classes are only offered at certain schools; however, this no longer needs to be a limitation. Remote schooling would allow students to explore their interests in ways that were not previously possible. Some students have difficulty attending school physically. Many students who are physically disabled or injured currently require special assistance to get to school; however, by removing the requirement of being present, these individuals would find education to be more accessible to them. Additionally, students who are sick would have no reason to go to school and risk spreading their illness to their peers, and could help prevent the spread of disease. By attending school from home, students can avoid physical bullying and other violence. Feeling unsafe is a commonly cited reason for skipping school. Additionally, fear acts as a barrier to learning, and does not encourage open-mindedness.

Distance learning improves the convenience, accessibility, and safety of getting an education. Those who oppose state that remote learning creates distractions, and distances students from the classroom environment, but this is not true. In conclusion, remote learning is a key step in forming a more educated and accessible world.
