Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that policy 2 is the better for all students. I believe that their are a lot of students that would use cell phone use to cheat. I don't think that middle school students are responsible enough to use cell phones without abusing their privilege. Many students already use their phones during class time, and if the rule was to turn it off during class time i think many people will break it. Many people don't follow the rules so i don't think it is right to reward them for it. Many student would like to use their cell phones but i think it would be best if they were off during school.

But i also think its wrong that the policy is no cell phones in school at all because if their off during school i don't see how they could be a problem. I think that policy 2 is the better policy but i don't think its absolutely perfect. I think that the best thing to do is to say the students must have them turned off and put in their lockers at all times. Policy 2 is the best for SCHOOL_NAME.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
