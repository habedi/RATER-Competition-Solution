In this life i think that there should be a limited amount of car usage. For the simple fact that gas is bad for the earth. In many way to some people this may be untrue. But I think that the limited amount of car usage would be great for the earth. My reason being is that car's make people excersize less, causes smog , bad for the enviroment.

To begin with, i think that limited amount of car usage is good for lazy people. I mean people will waste gas just to drive 3 minutes to a store when you could walk to save gas. It really makes no sense that a average person could be so lazy. You can be doing two good things at one time. By just walking for your health and saving up on gas,The text says,"Many experts expect public transport serving suburs to play a much larger role.

Next, I think it is a good idea because it wont cause so much smog which is a bad thing for the air. According to the text,"Paris has banned driving due to smog Paris enforced a partial driving bad to clear the air of the global city". The last thingwe need to do is be breathing in dirty air and pretty much gas. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. Twenty seven people had there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Also, My final reason is that it is bad for the enviroment. Luckily The text says,"President Obama's ambitious goals to curn the united states". Its about time some one point out the wrong honestly in my opnion if i was president i would ban driving to unless your like traveling to a far out state or your work is really far. I think that is should not be allowed.

So to sum it all up, I think that a limited amount of car usage would be good for the enviroment. And have a good impact on the world. Once again my reasons for it is that make's people excersize less, causes smog , bad for the enviroment. So my fellow citizens think about what you are doing to the world and how it not only effects us but how it also effects you.
