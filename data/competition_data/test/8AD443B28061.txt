Have you ever thought about what the world would do without cars? and we just used bikes or trains or skate boards or even buses? well in Bogota they have a day where you dont use your car and millions just biked or skated and took buses to work or school on the car free day. Its the third year cars have been banded in Bogota and the goal is to reduce smog. The people who didnt perticipate in this were charged with twenty five dollar fines.

Bogota isnt the only place that banded cars. paris actually banded driving due to smog. In paris the people were to leave their cars at home or they would have to pay a 22-euro fine which means thirty one dollars. You would think people would listen to them, but four thousand people decided to drive so they were all charged. All though this seems good becuase there would be no air pollution it wasnt so good for delivery componies because they complained about lost revenue.

Also in Germany they permitly banned cars. seventy percent of the familys do not own cars. But fifty seven percent sold a car just to move there. People say they are much happier this way like a Heidrun, a mother of two " when i had a car i was tense. im much happier this way" as she walked the streets. David Goldburg said " All of our developements since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change" he is an offical of the transportation for america, its a fast growing coalisition with hundrends of groups in the US. They are promoting new commuties that are less dependent on cars.

I feel that if the United States start doing this then the whole world might start. It would make the world a better place. There would be less air pollution or "smog" and you wouldnt have to pay fro gas anymore. Its also a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. If you need to go somewhere just ride you bike or if its far take a bus, its as simple as that. There would be less taxes and you wouldnt have to pay anymore car payments. " recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses asa each year goes by" most people dont drive becuase they either cant afford a car or they dont have a job.

In the end this may actually start happening. Bill Ford which is th eexecutive chairman of the Ford Motor Company was talking about a business plan in which vehicle ownership is impractical. he said that cities that "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network top save time, and improve safety." and he is completley right there will be no more car crashes or drunk drivers anymore, the world may become a better place.
