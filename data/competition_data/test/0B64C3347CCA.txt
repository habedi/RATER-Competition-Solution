I agree that all students should join at least one extracurricular activity because students could find out what they want to do when they get older by being in clubs that interest them and being in at least one club can also teach kids life skills and life lessons that can help them later on in their life(s). There can be a handful of benefits of being in just one (or more) extracurricular activity.

One main reason why joining a extracurricular activity is good is that kids can find out their interests if they haven't already. Most people don't figure out what they like or want to do until they finish high school or even later on. And what you want to be could change from time to time, but finding out what you like the most can have a good impact because when you like something you may or may not be good at it so doing if for a long time would help you improve. A person can have more then one interest which is perfectly fine because one can do both interests, such as if a person wants to be therapist but also wants to be a painter that person can be a therapist but in their free time can paint. Some families want their child to do what they like to do, but everyone should get to do what they are interested in.

Another important reason is that kids can learn life lessons/life skills. There are many clubs that can teach you these things such as debate club, serving on the student council, and sports can teach you about being active. There are a lot of things that a person has to face in life and sometimes you will not be prepared and that's okay, but it would be good if you have dealt with a situation like that so you will not be stuck. Being in a debate club, people respectfully agree about a situation which can help in the long run. By serving on the student council you learn about leadership, making hard decisions and sometimes doing things that you may not like that other people like to do.

Learning about life lessons/skills and finding out your interests could be a big help in life later on and can have many benefits to school, college, work, and many other things that come in a person's life. Just liking what you do even if you are not the best at it, would make most people happy. Just joining one club could help a person later on in life and that person will most likely be happy and enjoy what they do for a living.
