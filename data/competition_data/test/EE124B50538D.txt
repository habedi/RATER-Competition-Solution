Reading the emotional expresssions of students in a classroom is not valuable. It would be nice if we give the students some privacy maybe they can actually focus better. The reason why I think it's bad if we look at the students emotions is that we not giving them privacy to let them do what they want. If you give them a math test and they didn't pass the math test knowing the technologies is watching their emotions their going to be more nervous. A lot of students will not do good on their test. Their test scrore will decrease. Parents will be concerns abot their kids not passing their class and the principals will be in trouble. If only the technology where to help see their emotion on certain test and assissments their not good at and maybe the teachers or the consulors couuld help them do better on those things.
