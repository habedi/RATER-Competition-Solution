On May 24, 2001, scientists took their third photo of what had seemed to be a Martian Mesa, which had seemed to not look much like a human using their 3D camera to take a photo of it.

Look, as someone who's been a scientist for my whole life, and only researching on Mars features, I think I would know if there were any aliens on Mars. There have been a few signs of volcanic activity, and volcanoes on earth have formed something the exact same height. So I believe that a random volcanic activity is what has caused this Martian Mesa.

Besides, on April 8, 2001, it was proven by other scientists besides me that said it was a mesa, and there is on in in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa abount the same height as the face on Mars.

So if you really think that there is aliens on mars that created that then you are just absolutely crazy.

I have been researching mars my entire life and have found no tracks of an alien species, because if I had, I would have told you about it the second I knew. So if you really want to know what caused this Mesa, it was volcanic activity.
