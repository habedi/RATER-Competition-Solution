Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a great thing! Helping the community in any way is considered a good thing, and I think it's great that some students are doing this on their own already! But you and I both know that there are other kids that could care less about what goes on where they live, or how it needs help. And that's why I have a proposition for you.

I think that every student should be required at least one hour of community service each semester. Because everyone should be involved in the community, and the community could always use some help! No matter if it's picking up trash along the roads, or assisting at a an elderly home, help is always good.

Now of course, there will have to be proof that each student did their hour. I think the best way to do this would just simply be a signature. All we need is a slip of paper that the student can fill out, telling what they did as service, and for how long. Like, say, a student worked for two hours a soup kitchen. Then one of the workers at the kitchen could sign the students slip.

For some students, that one hour will be something they do just to get it over with, and then wont even think about again until next semester. For others, they'll do their one hour, and then maybe five extra hours after that.

And for those people, I think there should be a reward! The reward could be that for every extra hour each student does, they earn a homework pass. I'm sure if you decided to move with that idea, you'd have to get the teachers consent, though. Or maybe the reward could be a party at the end of the semester for the people that worked extra hours.

Needless to say, if there's a reward involved, most likely there will be more people willing to work extra hours. And eventually, those same people who thought, "The community is fine. I shouldn't waste my time trying to make it any better than what it already is!", will realize what kind of good they can do for others around them on a daily basis!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
