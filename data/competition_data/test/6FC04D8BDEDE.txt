Dear Principal,

I do believe that students should take part in community service as it is a helpful act toward the community in which you and I live in. Would you rather live in a community that is trashy and that looks bad, or would you rather live in a community that is superb in its cleanness? If you asked me, I would rather live in a clean community, wouldn't you?

Now I also believe in assigning community service to those who volunteer in doing the service. Also, the students who get into major trouble like suspension per say, should also be assigned for community service. Its kind of like how prison makes the prisoners do extra work around the prison, because its not like they just sit there in their cells all day.

Some students may think that helping the community is important, and if that may be the case, then let them feel free to take part in any kind of community service their heart desires to take part in. I wouldn't call that a bad thing at all to let them volunteer if they wanted. But, suspension rules should still apply if they wanted to or not. One of the goals for the school board is to let the students think that it is a good thing to help others in any kind of good way.

Some students might also think that its a waste of time and that they just don't want to do it. That should be totally fine, i wouldn't force any student to do the community service if they simply just didn't want to. But once again, suspension rules should still apply towards any student. Suspension rules also are that a student who has committed a bad deed and has a suspension coming their way, should be forced to participate in the community service to make up for the bad they have caused.

Helping pick up trash and tutor elementary students is just magnificent. I come from a very bad and messed up community in Detroit, Michigan. A lot of bad things occurred there at the hands of gangs and other people who were even in school but no one gave a care to give them any kind of punishment for it. For that reason, I think its safe to say that community service is a wonderful thing to take part in, but only if you want to and only based on suspension rules.

Sincerely, a Fellow Student
