Some people belive that the Driverless cars will be great in safety and mobility. Some belive that there going to cause many accidents. My personal opinion is that that it would be nice have. It would help people get place to place if they are nervous drivers. But I also think that there will be many flaws to this investment. There will most likely be accidents an mobile disfunctions. The manufactures of the cars will just have to be perpared for improvments and better qualities.

People will be giving ideas and wants for the cars too. My biggest concern is what if the driver happens to fall asleep and be heavy sleeper. The car has to wake up the driver but what if the driver sleeps through the warning? This could cause safety problems. I think only certain people should get these cars. Only older people that cant get around like they used to, teens or adults that are learning how to drive, and nervous drivers should use the driverless car.

There are many Pros and Cons about having the car. If the manufactures have proof that the cars will bee 100 percent safe then i would be definatly ok with them being on the roads. If they can not make the cars 100 percent safe then I would not allow them on the roads.
