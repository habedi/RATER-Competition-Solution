Summer is the students time to do whatever they like or want. When a teacher give the students summer project desingn by them, the students will feel like they still in school and that will effect students. Summer project should be student-designed because it is their time, they know what a better design for them, and some students like to experience the real world instead of doing project.

It is their time. Summer break is the time for student to do something out of school and to do something students would really like to do. Some students like to play sports like soccer, football, and basketball. Other students like to play video games on the summer break. Summer break for some of students is for them to set a goal like reading a 100 books, visiting 10 new counties, and to learn 100 new words. Summer break is special for students.

They can design what they think is right for them. Each students is different from the other, they have different thing to do and no one will really know them like their friends. Instead of the teacher designing the summer project, the student's friend can design the project for them since they know each other better than everyone else. The student's friend will choose a subject that their friend know a lot about it and love it. Teacher can give the students ideas for the summer project but student can choose them or pick what summer they would like to do.

Some students like to experience something to learn. Some of the students like to experience the thing they are learning about it instead of reading or doing 20 pages of writing. Some students do like to read and write instead of experience it and their friend should know that. Many student are looking for jobs in the summer break so they can make some cash and get experience for the future when they get a job. Experience something can be totally different than reading about it like diving, traveling, and playing sport. Some things are better to experience than reading.

Some people may say teacher should design the summer break project, however; summer project should be student-designed because it is their time, they know what a better design for them, and some students like to experience the real world instead of doing project. Some students get depressed because of school and sometimes leaving them to do design their project may help them get better.
