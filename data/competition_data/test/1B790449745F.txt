Have you always wanted to help somebody and travel on the seas. Well now is your chance to join the seagoing cowboys. The seagoing cowboys help people in Europe during world war 2 by delivering supplies to those in need. It says that in paragraph 2.

When you join the seagoing cowboys you will not only have a fun time, you also will get to help those in need. In Europe there are millons in need after the war. They need supplies and animals to survive after devastation in Europe. When you come home from Europe you also will have a fun time by playing baseball, table tennis, fencing, boxing,reading and whittling will help pass time. (It states that in paragraph 8) on the way home from Europe. You also will get to meet new people in Europe.

In my conclusion I think that the seagoing cowboys would be good for you. Because if you like serving then this is a big opportunity for you. Luke showed a lot of courage and potential by being a seagoing cowboy, and I think you would too.
