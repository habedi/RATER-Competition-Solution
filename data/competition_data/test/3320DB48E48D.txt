Did you know that some cities in the world are car-free? Cities like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota  don't use cars. There are many advantages when it comes to limiting car usage. Less cars mean a decrease in air pollution, alternative transportation, and fewer traffic jams.

Due to a near-record pollution, Paris decided to partially ban driving to clear the pollutants in the air. Usually, Paris is more polluted than other European capitals. According to Reuters, "Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe" (Source 2 paragraph 16 lines 3-5). America's second largest source of emissions is transportation.

Bogota, Columbia started a car free campaign in the mid-1990s to promote alternative transportation. Millions of Columbians celebrated this day by either hiking, biking, skating, or riding the buses to work. Two other Columbian cities joined the event. This car free day gives people a chance to improve the city. "...uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..." (Source 3 paragraph 28 lines 2-3).

Reducing the usage of cars also drastically cuts the amount of traffic jams. According to Andrew Selsky, "...rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic..." (Source 3 lines 30-31). Mimi Sheller says that "The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing an dhas drawn empty nesters back in" (Source 4 paragraph 35 lines 9-11).

The cities that have reduced car usage are making the planet a little better each day. Fewer traffic jams, decreases in the amount of pollutants, and alternative transportation can all happen if we decrease the amount of cars we use each day.
