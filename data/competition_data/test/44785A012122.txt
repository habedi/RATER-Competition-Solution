I think students get benefit, because I see some of they who recieved their diploma at home.

And I think if they won't benefit, so why they received their diploma at home?

They recieved their diploma, because they learn everything about the classes or courses that they choose, or they learn everything about what their read or watching, so that's why I think they get benefit take classes at home because if they choose to do the classes at home or online, that mean they can.

One of the most importante things that I see is how some students sacrified to take their classes at college, stay there, sleep there run to work, because if they doesno't work how they should be pay for the classes?

They can pay the classes in calm,Â taken the classes at home there they will be not tired to do their homeworks at night where is too late, because they are taken the classes onlien in their home where it doesno't matter at what time you go to bed because you don't have to wake up on time to go to college.

Here is another things that you can be get benefit if you take the classes online:

You get time to do any other things at home while you are doing your homework or watching a video about your classes.

When you are doing your homework and if the homework is watching a video, and if you are at home you have to write so fast, because you are at home so that's mean you can stop the video and copy the answer in calm.

You can read in calm your answer to be sure that are correctly.

You can take the classes at the time you want or that's what I think I don't know, but if you are at home you can make your own time to do everything and order.

You will be safe because you are at home.

You don't have to worry at mornings to drive all the way to college.

If you are taking the classes at home You don't have can get a traffic and be late at college.

Your family can feel happy, because you are at home and not to far way from home.

In my oponion this a good benefit, because every effort you do is a good is a good benefit, because you do this with your heart for every students is a dream go to college, so I think it doesno't matter the way you choose to go to college, the only thing that really matter is if you can dream it, you can do it.
