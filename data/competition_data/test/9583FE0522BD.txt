I disagree with what the principal has decided on. For one people have stuff to do when they get home anyways. Students like myself also have a lot of homework when they get home from school. Some kids just can't go to any after school activities because their parents work a lot and no one can drive them. Forcing students to do something they don't want to do is bad anyways.

So when I get home from school on someday's I have to go to tutor, or boy scouts. That's two days out of my week that I have used up. Sometimes my week is completely full when soccer season comes around and sometimes I have nothing to do after school. Then I usually just hangout with some friends because who wants to go out of there way in mid march when the sun is shining bright to go do student council. Not me that's for sure I'd rather have fun then do something I don't want to do or didn't sign up for.

I know were in eighth grade and people say they get more homework than us and that's true but the amount we get is just horrendous. Picture this your about to hop on video games or go play with your friends and then you mom says "Don't forget to do you math, science, civics, PE, German, and English homework." Like where did all that homework come from because I don't remember marking in my agenda thirty different assignments to do. If anyone thinks eighth grade is easy it isn't I have to keep my grades above a B or my parents go ballistic so do you really think I have time to make a yearbook.

Some kids can't go to certain things on some days because both of their parents work late. When I was in like fourth maybe fifth grade I couldn't go nowhere after school because my parents both worked late. I had to go to a daycare after school sometimes because they wouldn't be home in time to unlock the door because I couldn't be trusted with a key for some reason. There were many clubs I wanted to do but couldn't.

This is why I would strongly disagree with my principal if he made us do after school activities. If I was sixteen and had a car I wouldn't mind driving myself to go to an after school activities but my parents get home late so that's not gonna happen. The amount of homework I have to do when I get back already takes like an hour to finish. Don't even get me started about how booked up my weeks are sometimes. I can understand his viewpoint though because the principal just wants everyone to be active in the school and if the parents see that their kids are getting involved they might to.
