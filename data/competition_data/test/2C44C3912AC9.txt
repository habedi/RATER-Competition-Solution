Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometime we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones like driving while being on it. As a society we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety and health as well as others because we can't put our cell phones down.

Most people are guilty of using cell phones while driving. Although have we ever thought about it's danger? Five states plus Washington D.C. have hand-held bans and many states have bans for specific drivers. 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving.

In April, 2009 in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team were unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away. You start to think to yourself is a cell phone worth all the dangers?

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can try being careful because the money you put towards careless accidents that can be prevented can be put to the light bill etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving driving.

Insurance companies are just waiting for you to mess up so they can increase your insurance. Don't fall for it, your cell phone can wait till your out of the vehicle or when your parked. Especially with the new hands-free law in Georgia with some real expensive tickets so my best advice is to stay off your phone in the vehicle. The consequences are not worth it so just put the phone died.
