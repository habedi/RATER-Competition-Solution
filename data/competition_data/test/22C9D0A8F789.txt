Summer projects, although tidious and time consuming, are important. They are given to students by teachers to allow the students to retain the knowlege they have previously learned. They might also be given to teach the students new concepts before they enter the new school year. This allows teachers to teach a new concept at a faster pace since the students already taught it to themselves over the break. These project are very common in higher level classes because they require a higher level of understanding. These projects should be student-designed. I think that student-designed projects are a more efficient way for students to learn the required material over the summer break. It gives the students the flexibility that teacher-designed projects don't give. This is because students can design the project to their specific learning style and schedule and it allows the students to explore their creative side.

If students design their own projects they have the ability to cater to their own learning needs. Some students are visual learners. Some benefit from repitition. Each student is vastly different from next. For example, if someone knew that they were a visual learner, they could draw pictures about the topic that they are learning about. They could illustrate a storyboard about a major war or make a cartoon about how to solve a math problem. They would not benefit from making flashcards and memorizing words because their brain deems those tactics boring. When someone's brain recognizes something as fun and enjoyable, it is more awake and ready to work. This also allows the students who don't know the best way that their brain retains information to explore and find what works best for them. This could help students in the long run by making them aware of what tactics they can use to study for tests.

Students, especially high school and college level ones, usually have extremely full schedules. On the days they don't have extracurricular activities, they have work or home responsibilities. The range of what keeps a student busy is enormous. From a part-time job to band practice, students are overwhelmed with endless responsibilies. Allowing students to design their own summer projects gives them the ability to set their own work load. This takes some of the pressure off and still gives them the time to focus on other things in their lives. If a student only has two hours in their day to do school work, they won't design a project that requires them to research a topic for three hours a day and then write about it for two more hours. They will make something that allows them to research a quick topic and write a short paragraph so they can get in their eight hours of sleep.

Schools focus on challenging their students academically and they champion the students who thrive in the athletic department. Schools usually fail to give any attention to the students who excel in being creative and having problem solving skills. Student-designed school projects would allow those students to thrive in making up a unique and efficient way to learn a new concept. It would also be beneficial to the students who struggle in that area, allowing them to practice and explore new ideas. As a student who stuggles in being original and creative, I would be forced to research new ways of learning. It would make me practice thinking outside of the box which is an important skill that can be applied outside of a school setting and in the workplace.

Although student-designed projects allow students to make projects to their specific learning style and schedule and allows the students to explore their creative side, there are also things that teacher-designed projects are more efficient at. Teacher-designed projects make sure that what is needed to be learned, is actually learned. If a student designs their own project based on a broad topic, they may miss key terms or ideas that are essential to understanding the whole topic. When a project is guided by the teacher's instructions, students are less likely to be confused. There is also the chance that a student designs a project so they do not have to do any work. They can make one that requires them to only write their name on a piece of paper. Most projects are already teacher-designed and not many people have trouble understanding them. If students were to start designing their own projects it may leave students confused and unprepared for their class when the school year starts.

I think that teacher-designed projects can be beneficial, but not to every student. Allowing the students to make their own projects makes certain that every student will learn the material in their own style and at their own pace. When teachers design projects, many students don't understand and are left behind. Even though some students may design a project that is incredibly simple, not all students want self-sabatoge like that. Most students understand that summer work can set them up for success during the school year. I think that the pros outweigh the cons on allowing students to design their own summer projects. Student-designed projects allow students to learn by their own style, learn at their own pace, and explore and implement their creative ideas.Â
