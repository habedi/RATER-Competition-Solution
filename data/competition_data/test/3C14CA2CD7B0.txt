Hello my name is Luke. I am goung to inform you about Seagoing Cowboys Program, why you should join, and more. It is great Program that helps many people each year. This has really helped me be aware of other countries and their needs.

You should join this program because you are helping many people and animals. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys you go on trips to help animals after there has been a war. You get to play games. It makes you become more aware of other people. You get to interesting places. I had a fun time helping people. I went on 9 trips more than anyone else. Although it took along time to get to places i had a great time.

In conclusion, these times have been the best times of my life. I get to help many people and animals. You get to feed animals and meet new people.

I also have learbned more about each county i have visited.
