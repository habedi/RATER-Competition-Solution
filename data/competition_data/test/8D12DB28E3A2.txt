Dear Principle,

You have every right to ban cell phones from school and I understand that cell phones are a distracting liability to our learning, but please don't. Have faith in your students and trust that they will not abuse of their privilege to use their electronics in school. We promise to never use them in class or during a test because none of us want to be in any way embarrassed and on top of that, have our tests confiscated. Also, we could use our cell phones in case we forget things like lunch, homework etc, etc. Also, what if a classmate is absent? With our cell phones at hand, we could text them the homework and tell them what we learned about in class so they don't completely miss out.

You are probably questioning the first policy because of the chance someone may abuse this privilege and cheat but I promise that will not happen!! Because, see, none of us would risk getting our phones and tests taken away all at the same time because we were caught cheating. Also, none of us would want to bear the guilt of having taken away all of the other students' cell phone privileges. We would also probably not risk getting embarrassed by the teacher in front of the whole class either. So really, there is no reason we would use them in class anyway.

Also, what would happen if a fellow classmate was absent? Instead of taking focus off our own class work because we were also writing down the homework for our absent friend, we could just keep writing our own notes. And afterwards write the homework down. Only after the class would we, simply, text them the important parts of the notes, tell them what the teacher talked about during class and what we worked on and afterwards, tell them the homework that was assigned. So the next day, the absent classmate can come with no worries or stress about the work they missed.

Sincerely,

The Students
