i think that students should do community service whether they like it or not because sometimes i am too lazy to get up and clean my house like clean my room but then i think again its the smartest thing to do because you don't want your house to be all messy. for example when you go to sleep you don't want to go to sleep when it is all messy and then you cant walk. and another reason when you go outside to play or go to school or whatever you do. Then you go to the store then lets say you buy Sunflower Seeds then you spit out the seeds on the floor that would be nasty. Then sometimes i see dirtiness on the floor when im going to school then i say to myself why does nobody pick up the garbage that they see on the floor like sometimes i see sanitation trucks around but they come and go and never comes back for the rest of the day. All im saying is that some children want their community to be safe and other treat it like garbage and nobody does nothing about it. And another thing that i want to say is that children school is sometimes messy and then the janitor comes and sweeps or mops the floor. Then at lunch when the kids eat they eat all over the place and then the janitor has to suffer and clean. But some janitors enjoy doing it because they get money. And lets say there is a food fight in the school the children don't care because it is not their house or something that they care about then they end up making a mess. well im saying that i think that the principal should allow all the students to do community service and it helps the kids get better and know what they doing and get a better job in the future so when they grow up they could know what to do when they grow older and when they get a house all to themselves and teach their kids to do the same.
