Must Students Participate in Sports?

Students should have their own rights, if they do not want to participate in any activities like sports and clubs they shouldn't be forced to do them. If they do want to participate they can. If they do not want to participate, then we can't force any students to do any activities they do not want to participate in. Everyone has a voice and know whats best for themselves, others should not make any decisions for each other. This is because, other may not agree in what others think. Everyone must have a voice in what they think is right or wrong. Many students don't want to join in any activities and have other things to do.

Students already have lots of occupations they have in their own time. For an example they have to do school work, be social, clean, and lots more. By adding extra activities it ruins their schedule they have, and the amount of sleep they get. Coming late from practice or staying after to late may ruin the plans they had. Not being able to have enough time to study and do their homework because they were to busy, occupied with the activities they were forced to do.

Everyone needs time for themselves, and school work. Making time for yourself releases stress and if your too tired, you have time to get some rest and catch up on your house cleaning and homework. Studying and doing your homework really does have good effects on your grades. If you are doing your homework on time, the results are good grades. Studying for your classes or the test your gonna have, gives you a better chance of passing that test tomorrow. Which also results in a good grade for school.

The lack of interest may also be the reason why most students may not want to join any sports and activities. It may not be something they'd like to do. It may not be their passion and may not be something they enjoy to do. Forcing students to do somethings cannot make them like doing it, it just does not work like that. Frustration might happen next, causing students to not do good in the activities or not pay attention and get hurt. No student should be put in that position and be more stressed than they already are.

Occupations are a big part of everyone, because everyone is busy and have things to do. Being busy and having no time to do extra activities. Family time is a part of that, everyone needs time to have dinner together, go to church, be social, and have other things they already do without these extracurricular activities. It can ruin your sleep schedule which will put you in a bad mood and make you frustrated. Adding more things to do will make your day even more exhausting and harder which makes it a struggle, and may cause stress. This stress is unnecessary, we didnt choose to be in an activity and we must have a right to choose to be in one or not.

In conclusion, I disagree with this decision because students should not be forced to do any activities if they do not want to. They all have free will, and have a voice, to choose if they want to participate in anything. Students need time for themselves and school work because good results happen like good grades and great attitude. If students are willing to do the activities is because, the choose to but there's a good portion that may not want to get involved into those kind of activities which is okay. Everyone has occupations and have their own schedule, and most don't want to do other activities, because it may get in the way of what they need to do daily. Students must have a choice and an opinion in what they want to do.
