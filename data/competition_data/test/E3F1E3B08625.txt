3 years ago when I was new in this country I din't know anything of English but I learned some words on my English class. I remember that the school year was almost done and my English teacher din't assigned any books to read. The hard part was when the summer was over and we start school again that I didn't remember anything of English at all. For the next summer my counselor talk to my new English teacher and told her that I need read a lot in English. Also my counselor told to my English teacher to give me books to read during the next summer and she did it. That help me a lot to improve my second language skills I din't forgot anything at all. Some people said that summer projects should not be designed by teachers because students will not have time to learn things that they want to learn by their self, actually summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers will designed specific projects to help students prepare for the next school years and students will not forget what they learn before because they will continue learning.

Many people said that summer projects should not be designed by teachers because if teachers design projects for students. Students will not have the opportunity to design projects for things that students want to learn. For example, students got very stress during school year and they want to make something fun like watching TV, playing video games, and go out with their family. However students can do all what they want to do when teachers designed projects for them. Students have the all day, so they can do the projects that teachers assign them to do and have fun.

First reason, teachers will design summer projects that will help students prepare for the next school year. Teachers know what things students will need to know and how hard that class is going to be if the student is not prepare for the next year. For example, some students are very bad at math and they don't get any project designed by teachers during the summer. When the student is back to school and he get a higher math class he have a struggle year on that class because the teacher didn't assign any project for the student during the summer. Also teachers should design projects for students because students don't know about the new classes that they will take. It' hard for students to create their own projects to learn.

Second reason, teachers should design projects for students because that will help students to not forget what things the students learn in the year before. Teachers designed projects it will help students to review things that they learn and not forget a lot because students will continue learning. Some students are very far away from home because they are on vacations, but they can do everything from where they are. The projects that teachers design maybe will be on computers and students can take 10 to 15 minutes to work on projects, so they were learning and having fun during the summer. Teachers designed projects will help students to continue learning during summer that can make ease for students for the next year.

In conclusion, teachers should design summer projects for students because that will help students prepare for the next school year. Students can't designed summer projects because students don't know how hard that class is going to be. Also students will continue learning as they're doing the projects that the teachers dessing for them to do. I think if teachers don't assign summer projects for students they will not study. Teacher know what the student need and the summer projects will help students on summer. That's why I think teachers should dessing students projects.
