"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." -Eleanor Roosevelt.

Students who are a part of sport teams, student councils, art clubs, etc are more likely to find something they are passionate about and will have something to look forward to each day. When students participate in extracurricular activities they obtain certain skills that will be beneficial in their lifetime, and gain a new hobby/interest.

Organization, collaboration, and responsibility are just some of the skills students gain while participating in extracurricular activities. People always have to work together; therefore, it's better to learn how to collaborate well with others sooner than later. For example, if a student joins an after school soccer team they must learn how to collaborate with their teammates, even if they don't like them. This will benefit them later in life when they get paired up with someone they dislike and have to complete a project they will already know how to work through it.

Another important skill is organization,which is helpful, because student's will be able to take good notes, prepare neat projects, and colleges like it when student's applications are well-thought-out and organized.

In all, extracurricular activities provide many skills that students will be grateful to have later in their life.

After going to multiple extracurricular activities students are bound to find one that interests them, and they will hopefully continue to practice it. Once students find a particular activity that appeals to them they might be able to find a future career that involves in the same subject. For instance, if a student is looking at instruments that they would like and stumble upon the violin and they find that it is quite enjoyable. That student should continue playing it and practicing. In the future they could apply to go to a music school and get a job as a musician. Another reason finding a hobby is beneficial is that finding friends at school can be very difficult since students might not have anything similar. Although, when you sign up for a basketball team and try to make friends it is easier because, you already have something in common. Lastly, joining groups outside of school help find something your students are passionate about and they make lifelong companions in the process.

Participating in extracurricular activities will expand students knowledge of positive attributes and they will obtain many friends and will have joined teams that they might want to explore careers in. The only way students or children can achieve their dream is by practicing and participating in activities to show their portrait of a graduate skills.
