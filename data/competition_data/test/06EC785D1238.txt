At home learning can be beneficial because if you don't want to wake up to early to catch the bus, you can schedule a meeting with a teacher at any given time. If you are sick, something happened to a family member or your on vacation you will still get instruction online. Long distance classes can be helpful because you can find a class that works for you, lets say there was a teacher that you don't like you can just change teachers, and it would be easier to switch than public or private schools. Test taking would be a lot easier as well, you can use your notes and set up a day when you can take it online.

Taking online classes can be more helpful because it would help you relive some stress, like if you are meeting with teachers online stress might end up being less then at an sitting down in an actual school and trying to get everything done. You can also make your own time of day that you want to have a conference with your teacher, you could meet before breakfast, after lunch or even before dinner. You and your teachers can talk for awhile and they would be focusing on you and not other students, only giving you their full attention. You can ask the teachers for help its like they are doing a one on one tutoring and only your learning new material and it is every day. You and your teacher can also talk about what times would work best and how long you want the classes to be.

Taking online school classes can not only be helpful but they can help students who are struggling a lot, like if you missed something you can ask your teacher to go back and not feel embarrassed in from asking questions. Sometimes when students don't understand what the teacher is saying students don't ask because they don't want all the the attention on them. To be called on or asked questions sometimes give people anxiety or like they are scared to answer the question, however taking an online classes there will be less anxiety and more confidence.

However taking online classes has some downs as well, you probably won't get as much information as taking a regular school class. You probably won't have as many friends because you don't actually go to a private or public school. You probably have less time to do things with other people because you are taking an online class. If you fall behind things might get harder you will have little tutoring and if it isn't a one on one meeting and you don't understand you might not get as much help as you need.

Online tutoring can be helpful and can help you get on the right track of you wanting to do something really cool when you finish school. However making a schedule could be hard and if your not doing a one on one tutoring it might get hard but if you really concentrate and work hard in school you can accomplish a lot more than you think. It counts on you and what you want to do, public, private, or online school it's up to you and how you want to do with your education. What will you choose?
