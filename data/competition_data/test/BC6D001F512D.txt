Smog barely filled the air in VAUBAN, Germany. It's fortunate that 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold their cars to move to America. More and more people are promoting

"car reduced"

communities. Only 12% of gas emissions in Europe are caused by passenger cars.

People in France enforced a partial driving ban for a while just to clear the air of the city. People of that city where demanded to leave their cars at home if they had a license plate with even-numbers. If they disobeyed they had to pay a 31$ fine. Of course the following day it applied to people with odd-numbered license plate. The traffic went down 60% after 5 days of intense smog. Paris usually has more smog than othe European capitals.

BOGOTA, Colombia is where the car-free day was held. Many citezens participated in this event to limit car usage to reduce city smog. Violators faced a 25$ fine. But it was a pretty successful day despite the fact that is was raining, it didn't really stop anyone from not using their cars. The campaign tin Bogota began in the mid-1990s. More than one colombian city has joined this event

Cali and

Valledupar.

A

s of april 2013, the number of car usage per person has gone down nearly 9% lower than the point almost close to where the country was in January 1995 in the United States. And the numbers keep dropping down steadily as a study last year found that driving done by young citizens has been decreasing by 23% between 2001 - 2009. The only advantes that come from not using cars is that your city won't be filled with smog, you wont have gas emissions, and there wont be traffic jams.
