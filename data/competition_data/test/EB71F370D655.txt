Ever get bored after school, and just have nothing to do? Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Examples such as, participation in sports, working on the school year book, or serve on the student council. However, there is many pros and cons to this situation.

Meeting new people with the same interest is awesome, and could make strong bonds. 89% of students form better relationships when they have something in common with each other. Examples include, same taste in music, art skills, outdoor sports, movies, and video games. Students can work together, and make their passion a reality. All because students stayed after school.

Today's birthday is the mother of a student, but the child has to stay after school. Most students wake up around 6:00am to 7:00am for school, and leave school from 2:15pm to 3:00pm. Therefore if our principal makes students do an extracurricular activity it would last up to 5:00pm. Which makes school days 10 to 11 hours, and only about 5 hours of family time. So should that student stay after for math just to find the slope of a line or spend their rest of the night celebrating their mothers birthday?

Student stress levels are just getting higher, and higher each year. From 2016 to 2020 studies shown that the stress level in teens has increased to 78%. Students have 5 core classes, and 2 electives which is 7 classes in total. Students have lots of school work, and it could get overwhelming. Staying another 3 hours for an extracurricular activity could result in more stress, pressure, and just the feeling of getting consumed by millions of assignments. It could be fun doing what you love, but in the back of teens minds they have to study, practice, understand knowledge just to get a grade above a B.

So ever get bored after school, and just have nothing to? Join actives with people that have common interests. If you agree make sure your stable enough to do so. Because grades can go down, and relationships can start to fade. But if your really invested to do what you love theres always activities such as, participation in sports, working on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.
