Requiring students to complete a project over summer break should be teacher designed. By the project being teacher designed, a student can expect the full growth and general knowledge they are capable of. If students designed the project, only a little bit of work would be accomplished. Therefor, the project should be teacher designed, it would challenge the students, give them a earlier start to the next grade level, and improve all of their students academic fields of learning.

Teacher designed projects would challenge the students more. If students were to design the project themselves, some students would make it meaningless and easier to accomplish, so they can enjoy their break. So, teachers should design the projects, it would make it challenging, and give the student the ability to actually learn and complete the assignment, rather, it being easy and meaningless. The more the brain is challenged, the more knowledge it is capable of learning. The more a student learns, the more of a head start you will have on the next grade level.

By the project being teacher designed, you can have a head start, or a earlier advantage to the next grade level. Student designed projects would be based off of last years academics, which means they will have no advantage for next year. Teachers know what students need for next year, so the project should be designed by the teachers, will allow students to be successful. It will help by enhancing the students growth in all aspects of academics.

Teachers will make the project challenge all of the students academic fields. Students would only study and want to learn things they already know and are familiar with. A teacher can broaden the field and make it diverse. One day you could study math another science. Therefor, the student will grow in all academic fields.

Teachers should design the summer projects. Students would accomplish more, start a great track to the next school year. The student would be more prepared for next year, they will be challenged, and grow and flex in all aced micÂ fields of learning. So, go to a teacher, a principal, or go to your local school board office, and bring this issue up and make a change.
