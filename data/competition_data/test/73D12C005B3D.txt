I disagree with what the principal is trying to do some kid's don't have the time to do a extracurricular activity. Some kid's have a life outside of school and many have responsibilities some just probably can't afford the fee for the after school extracurricular activities.

Most kid's when they leave school they probably have other important things they have to do. Such as out of school sports or even stuff around the house. Even if they don't have thing's to do after school kid's don't have thing's to do after school kid's don't wan't to spend more time at school your already spending eight hours in school plus homework. On top of that you might not get home until night time and the other thing's that you wanted to do after school you probably can't do them now. All because of the principal wanted all kids to have a extra activity and most kids are not even fit for that kind of stuff. Most kid's probably don't think there smart enough so I dont think she should make that call just because she can does she care what other people have to say about it.

Many parent's can't pay for extra activities my mom tells me all the time does it look like i'm made out of money .So I think the principal should make everything be free some kids parent's don't work and they want to spend there money on better things. They wan't to spend it on whats needed like food,bills,and even clothes. The parent's don't want to spend there money on something there kid's dont' even wan't to do .So at least what she can do is make everything free so that people can actically do what you want them to do.

In conclusion I don't think the principal should give kids extracurricular activities she should really care about how the kid's feel. This idea is good but you should really see how other's feel about the whole situation before you make the dission .This is why I disagree now because I don't think she asked the student's how they feel about it and I probably would have been okay if she would ask how everyone else feels about it.
