Dear Principal,

Cell phones are a huge part of teens lives. Many have them and use them constantly. If teachers can use their cell phones students should be allowed to also. I think you should allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as their phones are turned off during class time.

Allowing students to use cell phones is a great idea for many reasons. First, students can increase their social life. Students can call and text their friends to make plans to get together or to have a study date. Also, students can use their cell phones to help them meet with others during study periods or to sit together at lunch. Many teens use their cell phones for emergency and not just to talk to their friends. Parents may need to arrange for their child to be picked up from school and have no way of getting in touch with them. Lastly, cell phones can help students with communication skills. Some teens are very shy, but talking on the phone can help them communicate and become more outgoing.

Finally, banning cell phones is simply unjust. Teachers get calls in the middle of class and are allowed to answer. Teachers should not even be able to have the ringer on their cell phones during class. Teachers should need to wait to lunch or a free period. Students should be able to have their cell phones and use them during free periods as well . After all that is time for the students to do what they want.

Thank you for listening to what

I have to say. I hope you can come to the right decision. Please take this into consideration when deciding the new cell phone policy.

Sincerely,
