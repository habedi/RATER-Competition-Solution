How do you feel about students having to do an extracurricular activity? I believe that it would help students be better people. These activities will keep them out of trouble. Extra activities with new people will help improve the social skills of students. Activities such as sports will keep them healthy and active. Do you not want students to be better people for others, and themselves?

First, Students that have an extracurricular activity will stay out of trouble. When a student is doing something good for them self, and they enjoy it, they will not be getting into much trouble. If students are playing a sport they will be motivated to stay healthy and stay away from drugs. Most extra curricular activities require good behavior. Therefore, if a student gets attached to an activity they will do their best to stay out of trouble.

Secondly, Students that less social skills can meet new people. Those students can create strong, long lasting bonds. Extra curricular activities can give students the friends they need that make them happy. Some friendships are even like family, and those types of bonds are important. We need students to have strong bonds and stronger social skills.

Finally, These activities can keep the students healthy, and active. Sports will have students always moving and keep them in shape. Some activities will teach you about nutrients and how to support your body. Activities like these will keep you healthy and make you feel better about yourself. If everyone participates in these activities than everyone will be happy, healthy, and active.

In conclusion, I believe that extra curricular activities will make students a bigger part of society. These activities will get students to behave. The students will be healthy. The activities will give the students better social skills. That is why I believe that extracurricular activities will make students be better people.
