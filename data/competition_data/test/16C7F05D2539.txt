The face is just a natural landform because of the environment. You can't just look at an unusual figure then automatically assume that it's something totally different without even observing the details around that object. Few scientists believe the 'face' was an alien artifact, though it was just a mesa.

It takes a lot of time and money for the correct equipment to take in and to judge whether or not this is a face. People have taken many missions and explorations to Mars snapping photographs as soon as they could get a good shot of it.

In today's generation people have a better chance to prove somebody wrong or right by getting evidence. Luckily technology is more advance and accessible, so the evidence will be more clear and approving to your target. Though it's very hard to spot your target in outerspace, the Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine. The Mars Global Surveyor was close enough to get another view. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the firld of view. They captured a photo using the camera's maximum resolution. The picture was better than the phone that was taken 30 years in the past. The picture was actually shown to be the Martian equivalent of a mesa.
