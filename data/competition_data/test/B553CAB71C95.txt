Cell Phone Usage

In our everyday life we always have a cell phone either in our hand or right next to us. In this society we have grown to use our cell phones for everything we do. It has become our everyday usage. I believe drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle as it can be distracting and cause many accidents.

The cause of many accidents is due to people using their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Many people think if you just look down on your phone for a second no harm will be done. Well that is not the case, all it takes is one second for your life to change. You have to think if that text is worth it and think of all the possible outcomes from just doing that. It is best to put your phone on, do not disturb and have your phone out of your sight. Not only should you think about yourself but the other people on the road. Car accidents can cause death to many people with that one second distraction. A lot of times when people do use their phone while driving it was not even worth it, so again think if it is worth the pain you can cause others.

Driving consists of you having your eyes on the road at all times to ensure everyone is safe. Phone usage while operating a vehicle is a distraction to not just yourself but to others. Many states have laws on using your phone while driving. In Georgia it is prohibited. This can decrease the amount of car accidents that happen on the road. In fact, it has decreased the numbers in many states when they force this law in. People who are not multi taskers also can cause a lot of harm in the road for people as they can not do more than one thing at once.

There are many reasons why people use their cell phone while driving but the only valid reason is when they're using the gps. There are still many cars that do not have a built in gps system so it leads people to use their phones to guide them to their destination. Which still is not a good excuse. They can always listen to what the gps is saying without looking at their phone. Many people feel they need to see it visually in order to follow it. Uber drivers use their phone at all times when they're on the clock. Their whole work is operated on a phone but many usually have a phone holder if they believe they need to visually see it.

In conclusion, I believe drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving. As I explain it can lead to many accidents and distract you on what's important which is the road. You are not only harming your safety but others. So before you think about using your phone ask yourself is it worth it.
