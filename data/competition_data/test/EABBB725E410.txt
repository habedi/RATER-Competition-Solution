Dear Principal,

It is a fact that most students would rather spend their time at home or out with friends, but I think that it is a great idea for students to get involved in community service. It builds character and allows students to get involved within the community. Doing community service reveals opportunities for students when they are older, it lets them see the realities of the real world, and it also puts a smile on other peoples' faces. Community service is a need for the community.

Those students who don't do community service never get to see their likes and dislikes in jobs, so it may be harder for them to find a profession in college. When students spend time doing community service, it reveals jobs a student may want to do once out of school. For example, if one likes to work in a nursing home, it doesn't mean that one is going to get a job in a nursing home, it shows that one likes to take care of people and that means that person would be good as a doctor, nurse, or anything involving people in need. When people pick up litter, it does not mean that those people are going to be garbage men or something of that nature, it shows that they care for the environment and wildlife, and may consider going into a field that involves them. By doing these things, it also gets students out of the house.

Being shown to the real world is important for any young person. Reason being that if they aren't, they will not be prepared and probably will have no idea how to deal with it other than running back to their parents for help. When having to actually have a job and work to get what one wants could be a problem for some. Doing community service could change that. Volunteering at a concession stand at the local sports fields and having to get what the customer orders, or working at a nursery and seeing that one has to take care of something and, also, having the urgency to take care of their needs could be an eye opener for some. That is where community service may be essential.

If those reasons are not good enough then i think that the most important part is that community service makes everybody's day better. For being the person who is doing the community service to the people that get to watch, people get to see that they care and that the future is in good hands since students are the future leaders, doctors, and all of those important jobs. Community service builds character and teaches life lessons without students even realizing it. Community service makes better people.

Community service is what students need to do. It should be required but not be a bad thing or another project. It should be something that people enjoy doing especially if you do it with friends. I hope that i have made it clear that community service is the way to go.

Sincerely,
