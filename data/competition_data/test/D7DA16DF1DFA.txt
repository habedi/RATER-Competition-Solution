Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to be able to bring their cell phones to school to use during lunch and other free periods.

This will allow students to talk to their friends and help them enjoy their time off from the long day of work they put in. It is also important that students bring their cell phones to school because it allows them to communicate with family or friends about plans or other after school activities. Students should turn them off during class so they don't disturb the class and affect their learning. If you allow students to bring their cell phones and allow them to use them during lunch periods or other free periods it will cut down on texting in class. I think this because now students don't have to text during class they just have to wait until their lunch or free periods. Which I think every student can do.

The problem with not having students bring their cell phones at all is that kids are going to do it anyway because they really depend on their cell phone for different things. Like I need to bring my phone to school not to talk to my friends, but to now how I'm getting home with my sport practices. So it is really important for me to bring my phone school.

I think your first policy is great because of numerous reasons. So it allow students to talk to their friends and now what they are going to do after school. As long students don't use them during class I think everything should be fine. Thank you for your time.

sincerely,
