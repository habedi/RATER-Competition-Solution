Dear Principal,

I think students should not take position in community service. My reason of this opinion is because not all students have time for community service hours. Some might do sports or any other after school activities. Some students also have commitments at home, jobs, etc. I think community service should only be for those who have made negative decisions in or out of school.

For example, if a student decides to skip school for a whole day without their parents or the school knowing that he/she is not in school then he/she should take position in community service for making a bad choice. Now if someone just chews gum in class or eats something when they are not suppose to they should just be punished such as detention or staying at school after classes are over. If a student gets in trouble out of school, such as with the police, the should take position in community service. I think that if a student is required to do community service but they are not in trouble, then they should do something simple such as reading to those who are blind or do after school tutoring if they have time. If you are doing community service because you have gotten in trouble at school or with the police then you should do something more of a punishment.

Such as cleaning a school or shoveling people's driveways during the winter time. They can also repaint or wash buildings. These are just a few examples of hard community service. This is my reasoning of students not taking position in community service.

Sincerely,
