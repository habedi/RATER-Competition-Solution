Mona Lisa's 83 percent happy, 9 parcent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal," observes Dr. Huang, "even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression." in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinchi studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convery specific emotions. His new computer software stores smilar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of "Da Vinci Code"! The Mona lisa demonstation is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around my eyes. The muscles will not make lie, so Mona Lisa have wonder parts of human. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.

These are essay, so we can know the Dr., Hung and The Vinci are so good person and very smart because my summary shows that.

I thought the Mona Lisa had not alive at their time, so she is just picuture.

I will find some good art. It will be better than Mona Lisa. We colud get informatin if we have science knowlende. I understood the art world of little.
