dear principal:

I think we should have community service. we wont our state to look good, we need it so we can do good things. when we start doing that our state will start getting publicity where our state can do better things. we need to start recycling things so we can make money and save the planet.

if we do this it will help a lot in our state.

if some people don't wont to do anything don't make them do anything. all you have to do is shorten something at school that they like to do and say its pay back. you can help the person that wants to work by doing something for them like throw a party.

And if we started community service i would make elementary pick up litter .then i would make junior high clean buildings. i would make high school go and help he elderly.
