Dear senator, i argue that we should keep the electoral college. elecotral college is a process that was established by the founding fathers in the Constituitions as a compromise between election of the presodent by a vote in congress(Office of the Federal Register).Â  the electoral process consitsts of the selection of the electors, meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress (Officer of the Federal Register).

the electoral college has 538 electors. a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. your state's entitled allotment of electofd equals the member in the House of Representatives. Under the 23rd ammendment, the Dostrict of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Because of this, the word "state" also refers to the Districe of Columbia.

however, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of ekectoys, who turn to elect the president. one bad thing about the electoral college is what m=we might call the disaster factor, the americsn people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggerst election crisis in a century; the system allows much worse.

All in all, Mr Senator, i think that it would be a good idea to keep the electoral college. the process makes a huge difference between voting for presidents and voting for someone to vote for potential presidents.

Sincerely,

Student
