Do you thing the face on mars is just a natural landform? or perhaps do you think it is a face? Well guess what? Well from what the story says its a possibility that it could just be a natural landform.

first, in the story it says" its's not as easy to target Cydonia". This mean its not as easy just to pop up and see it. meaning theres a possiblity thats not it because it wouldn't of been that easy to find.

Second, most scientists think it was an alien. In the story it says" Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at tge REd PLanet in sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the viking missionsended". which means they never know what it is it can be a alien or an face but most likely just an alien in their case.

Last , you dont just see pass the face any other time. As it says in the story "We dont just pass over the face very often". With that being said its not some you can just see any minute its maybe once out of a blue moon or your just lucky.

Well with all of the information its possible that its just a natural landform. Its nnot so possible for it to be the face like some scientist said because its not the simple you have to work very hard to find one.
