DEAR: PRINCIPAL

As a student in SCHOOL_NAME i take place for several student in school that we should have community service in middle school and high school too help the community service and you as the principal should have student help for community service, the reason why we should have community service is so we can have a better world, better pollution and not have the world as is now with all the dirty streets. And having people get sick by the littering in the streets.

People that make litter the streets should get a tike, Because they are making our world a bad place.

To have students to perform community service we should make it enjoyable so student wold not fine it boring. littering it happened all the time in any place and at any time people that litter should now that they are making bad world, for them self not just them everybody in the world it can be children's or baby's that are going to pay the consequence later on the year.

some people in the bitches have drop drink in the water and have don something that affects people and animals in different ways.

Some people help them self to have community service and have clean streets and not have a street that look bad. they now that they want a better future for there child's. people this days are have problem because of the littering of other people that make the world a bad place to live on. people that litter should have tickets

What i think is that we should have perform community service in Stamford public school, to tell the principals that we should have community service in middle and high school. And people out there in the streets STOP LITTERING the streets so one day we can have a better world and not have people being stick because of the littering. i' m telling all the principals in Stamford that we should have students help community service.
