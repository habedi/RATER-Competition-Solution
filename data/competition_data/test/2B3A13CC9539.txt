There are many reasons to join the program . Today im gonna convince you that people should be able to join.

I think it would be a great idea to join the seagoing cowboys program because... It would benifit them, they would be able to explore the world & i honestly think that would be great for them to experience the world. Another one is being able to help the animals with trouble that have been injured or left on the streets.

A good thing is you get to spend time with animals all day long! I think that would be fun. What i think is more fun is spending your time in the ocean, imagine being in a boat & all of the sudden you hear dolphins! How great would be?

Its not all just about helping animals once there all prepared & token care of you get to play with the cowboys! Baseball anything you desire they'll play. What its really about i s opening yourself up to the world & being grateful for trying the oppurtunity & giving it the best you got! & being aware that other people need needs. Not just you, but other people will appreciate you.

But honestly my conclusion you should sign up because i think it would be fun & adventoures!
