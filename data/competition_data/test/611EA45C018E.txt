In the passage, the author does not support the idea well. The formatting of the essay is incorrect. The supporting details are also extremely unrealistic.

In the passage, the author states that the surface temperature is so high, that it can melt a vast amount of metals, therefor it would make sense for humans to not go. Later, they state that scientists are working on a blimp-like vehicle to float thirty miles above Venus's surface. This refutes the the part of the essay in which the author is explaining that scientists would have to go to the surface to collect research samples.

Also, the whole idea of exploring Venus is undermined because floating thirty miles above defeats the purpose of exploring Venus, as the author states the atmosphere makes it difficult to view using photography and videography. This would make reasearch extremely difficult because they will not be able to see the planet's surface.

The author does not sufficiently support their argument. The evidence used is unrealistic. The author continues to make arguments for their side and then refute them.
