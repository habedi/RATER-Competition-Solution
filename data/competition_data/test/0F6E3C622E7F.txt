Have you ever done something even though a parent,guardian,or doctor told you not to? In my opinion you and your parents should be able to decide if you can participate in an extracurricular activity. I disagree that the school can make students participate in a extracurricular activity because of medical reasons, parents might disagree with the activity, and the child might not agree with the activity ,or the student might just not want to participate in the activity. therefor I think students should be able to chose if the want to participate in the activities.

students should not have to discus all their medical issues with the school. these medical issues that some people have might not let them play in sports or they could struggle with reading. Some medical disorders like down syndrome or dyslexia might be the reason that some people will not play sports. Because they might get sat on the bench during a game, and they could feel left out and that would lead to other medical disorders.

Their parents might say they cant do some sports or activities. Or they think that the school should work on the yearbook, and would prefer their child not to work on in. If parents think that schools are wrong for making kids do at least one extracurricular activity they should not have to participate in that activity. In my opinion parents and students should be able to chose. and i thin it's a right for the parents and children to chose.

if students disagree and parents agree they can make them participate. On the other hand what if they both disagree? If they both disagree then they should mot have to do an activity. because the school bored can not make students do much other than show up and leave. who would want to be in the student council anyway!

In conclusion schools should not be able to make children participate in extracurricular activities. Because some kids have medical disorders, their parents might not agree with the activity ,and the students might not agree with the activity. also the childrens parent, guardian,or doctor might have told then not to do certain sports.
