Students should be given a choice whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities. While extracurricular activities may be beneficial for some, it is not for all. Students may lack a method of transportation while participating in these actives. Other students may not have the time to be able to put forth effort in these activities. Despite still being minors and most of us having food, water, and shelter provided we still have duties we must complete day-to-day.

Many students at various intellectual levels participate in extracurricular activities. They participate in activities such as but not limited to: Football, Student Council, and Yearbook Committee. Furthermore, each student who participates in these activities are rewarded in different ways. An example of this may be for Football players, if you excel in the sport you could be awarded scholarship funds and possibly a career. But, not all students need these "rewards", some students are fine as is. Bounding all students to an activity would be unbeneficial to students may already have activities un-school related.

Not every child grows up with multiple parents; Not every child grows up with a parent/guardian to supervise them while the other is at work; Not every child grows up middle class. Many students do not have anyone to pick them up after school, so they stick to public transportation. With the addition of extracurricular activities to these students plates, they many lack a method of transportation to and from school. Some students can't even walk to school because of how dangerous their neighborhood is. Extracurricular activities will not only cause inconvenience but also may cause dangerous unwanted situations unravel in these students lives.

As I mentioned at the start of my third paragraph, not every child grows up in middle class. Some families are extremely impoverished barely getting by day to day. So as soon as their children are of age they send them out to get a job. They don't do this as a way to hurt or punish their children. It just helps give their family more support, this way there is more money provided within their household. With extracurricular forced upon these hardworking students they would be forced to work less hours, earning less money. Food stamps and other government provided forms of funds for impoverished families can only bring them so far.

In conclusion, forcing students oblige and participate in these needless activities would cause nothing but harm. I believe it should be optional, you work hard at school and once the bell rings it should be your time to do what you want to do. But even so, we're still bombarded with tasks and left thinking before we go to bed each night:

"Did I complete all my homework? Did I study for my science test tomorrow? Did I sweep and mop the kitchen?"

Do you really think we should take that sliver of free time we earn at the very end of the day and instead replace it with more useless work?
