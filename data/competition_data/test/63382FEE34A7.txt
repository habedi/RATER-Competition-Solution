Summer projects are something a student always dreads during vacation, maybe your at the pool and you remember that you have to do a research paper for your science class that has to be turned in on the first day of school. So you get ready to work on it but you dont know what to do it on and you get stuck since your supposed to choose the topic and the format your research paper is going to be in. Giving students the opportunity to design there own project is good, but students forget so much during vacations that they have no prior knowldedge or forget how to do certain things. This is why Teacher designed projects during the summer are a better idea then student designed projects. Since students can understandably be too busy enjoying there vacation they can forget how to do certain things or have problems making decisions for there projects. on the other hand if teachers design these projects they can make a rubric on what to include points, topics, and even examples and if any students are confused they can just email the teacher. Ive had experience with a teacher designed project or assignment and it turned out way easier then I thought it would be even when I had difficulties me and my teacher were able to work out a solution so I could finish the project.

Summer vacation for students is a time to relax go travel or visit other family members maybe get ready for a summer sport. Most students wont even think about there work until the last month of vacation when this happens thats when students start to panic. Projects can also be hard if a student goes out of country for the summer and doesnt have acess to technology at all times and struggle to create a project that gets high points. Even if students have acess to technology, during large gaps like summer vacation students can tend to forget many things they learned during the school year since they arent really learning anything. Students are more likely to get a better grade on there projects if they are given certain tasks that they have to do to complete there project so that they dont stress out over the work they have to do.

In comparison Teacher designed projects can be easier to follow since most teachers will leave specific directions that you have to accomplish. This takes away from the stress of coming up with something yourself and sometimes wasting time looking for the right topics. Teacher projects can vary depending on classes like for instance an English might make you read a book then give a report on it and they give you a series of books that you can choose from. Most Teacher projects have a goal or something they want you to accomplish ,so its really clear what they want you to do and how to execute it to get the best grade possible. Reaffirming my statement most teachers will give a rubric or packet to show what you have to do and maybe even examples so you can have a better idea of what they want from you. This method can give students a clear picture of what they need to do and they can plan what work they should complete now and which to do later. Even then students might still be confused so if they really are stuck they can just email the teacher since most teachers will give there email before summer break begins just in case students have questions.

I had a experience with my AP government teacher where before the class had even started he had left us a assignment/project to do. He explained that this project was so we could start the year sprinting and fly through the first couple of units so we could get to the important topics about government. I went travelling to visit my family in Canada and didnt start doing the project until there was a month left. everything seemed pretty easy by itself and everything was clear, but I was supposed to print the the documents after I had finished completing them and I didnt have a printer. I was able to email him to see what I could do and he recomended I just answer the documents in paper and to just hand it to him when school started. i was able to have a nice summer and still do the work and when school came by i was able to give him the work.

Even though teacher designed projects are a bit easier and straight to the point it doesnt give you much option to be creative or do much else. Student projects can be more fun and give a greater sense of purpose since your choosing what your going to do for your project. This gives room to people who are really passionate and creative about theyre topic and they create amazing things. by putting restrictions and limiting the ammount that these people can do it makes them feel less motivated and makes it seem like they are just doing simple work instead of doing something special. this can hurt them and maybe even make them lose interest in the class that they generally like.

In conclusion even though Student projects offer more purpose Teacher designed projects are more simpler and easier to understand so students dont have to stress when they are in vacation. Teachers provide clear directions and can offer help when needed so students can focus on being with there familys and relax. Students can have a rough time doing there projects if they are given vague instructions for doing it and they end up wasting time and not making a good final product. From my experience i was able to complete my work and work through troubles I had with my teacher so I do believe that Summer projects should be Teacher designed.Â
