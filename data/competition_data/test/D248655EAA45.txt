Riiiiing! Riiiiing! Like a teacher's cell phone has never gone off in class! I think that if teachers are allowed to have cell phones in school, students should be able to too. Eliminating the nuisance by having a no cell phones in school policy would just cause a bigger problem. Parents might get angry because they do not have the ability to reach their children after school since they couldn't take their cell phones to school. Also, more students would get in trouble because they brought their cellular devices to school and since its not allowed, got it confiscated. Students would get themselves landed in detention , so clearly, there's just going to be a bigger problem when kids can't bring their cell phones to school.

If students can bring their cell phones to school, but not use them in class, it's their fault if they get in trouble. Cell phones should be allowed in school to avoid a lot of controversy.

In TV shows, the teachers always hate doing detention don't they? They have to base it off of something, so wouldn't that be based off of real life? Taking cell phones away would just make more kids go to detention. Instead of only having to do it one or two times a week, it would be everyday. That would also make parents angry because maybe they told their students that they needed to take their cell phone because they had to have a way to be contacted after school. But, some mean teachers don't take excuses from parents or kids which can make people outraged.

If the principle went with Policy 2, I'm almost positive that there would be a court case about it. You can't just not listen to the parents, they are the ones that pay for the school. Shouldn't they make the decisions here? Parents would be mad because not only do they buy their kids cell phones for safety, but now that their kids would not have them, they're A students would be getting in trouble a lot more often and the teachers aren't going to listen to the parents that it's their fault. It's important for students to have cell phones at least at lunch and other free times than not at all. That way they could call their parents if they were perhaps walking to Starbucks after school with friends or their game was canceled.
