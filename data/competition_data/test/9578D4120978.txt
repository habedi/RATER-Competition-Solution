To Whom It May Concern,

Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times would be a great cell phone policy in my opinion. I believe this is best because a lot of students have cell phones and there are many different reasons they can use them.

Being able to use cell phones during lunch and other free times is great. For instance someone could have forgotten something very important that they may need to have for that day and instead of having to walk all the way through the hallways to go to the front office and possibly disturb any of the other activities going on, they can pull out their cell phones and ask their parents or whom ever has what they need to bring it to them.

Emergencies don't happen that often at school, but if one day everybody was doing there normal routine then someone gets hurt and it's a really bad injury a student can take out their phones and call for help. Like if the students are outside waiting to get into school or waiting for someone to pick them up and something happens that would be a good time to use it to.

If there's ever any free time in class and the teacher just want to finish up some work instead of hearing the students complain that they have nothing to do and they have finished everything, the teacher can let them use their phones for a couple of minutes until the bell ring or they have finished.

Some may not agree with these reasons, but they may have an effect on the decision he or she makes.

Sincerely,

A Student
