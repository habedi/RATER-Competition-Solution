The Innovation

Driveless cars are a big deal in our modern ,new and innovating society. We try to grow and improve every single and ask ourselves how we can change. Many companies such as Google, Audi and Nissan have an idea that could possibly change the world. Driveless cars are what we all have been waiting for ages. Though many people agree with the idea that driveless cars are the next big thing others simply disagree. There are many pros and cons with the innovation of this project.

I agree with the idea that we should try our best get some driverless cars out on the streets. We as the people on Earth should want the world to grow bigger and better, to grow brighter and smarter. Look at us today, we would not have had many of the things we now do if we had never put so much effort on it. Forexample computers, cell phones and even the process harvesting crops. A lot of ideas have bloomed from technology.

Technology plays a major role in our life, and if driverless cars are the next new idea then I fully support it. Just image how much driverless cars could impact our everyday lives. It could make public transportation so much innovative and easier. perhaps driverless cars can lower are car crash and violence rates on our roads. Driverless cars could also help out many people who are hurt or in desperate need of help in certain situations. Driverless cars could be healthier for our enviornment, but who will ever know if do not put time into this project.

Although having driverless cars are great many do not agree. They believe that it is something dangerous and something that nobody should mess with. They believe that it is out of this world and we should not put any money into this project. I agree that this project can fail but atleast we can say that we tried it, right?

We as human beings learn from our mistakes and as of now there are companies like Google who are already making a change. They have dedicated hundreds of hours into cars who today have driven themselves with a passenger more than half a milliion miles without a single crash.

The have asked themselves that same question and now we have electric cars, cars with sensors and cameras, cars with gps. We have alerts systems in our cars now which keeps us safer. A couple of years ago we had none of these things.

Driverless cars are in the near future. People have dedicated so much time and knowledge to improve are generations to come. There is always something new to improve so lets let it be cars for now, 2020 you are just around the corner.
