Dear Principal,

I believe students should be able to use cell phones during lunch and other free times during school. I think this because it would be a faster way to get a hold of parents if a student needs something. The school phone sometimes has a line and some teachers will not allow their students out of class to call home. Another reason this would be a good policy is because students would get in trouble less. My last reasoning for supporting this idea is because it could help kids organize they're schedules and plan better for due dates.

Allowing students to have cell phones during free time would enable them to call or text a parent if they needed something. For example if I forgot my lunch or gym clothes I could text one of my parents in between classes or during lunch. Another reason is that some kids forget to tell their parents about after school commitments. Instead of having to wait until the end if the day and give family members a short notice to pick them up they can text them earlier so parents know about it sooner. Also some parents can't answer their phones all the time during work hours. So if kids needed something they can text or email their parents allowing the parents to find out what their child needs sooner.

If students could have cell phones during school less students would get into trouble. A lot of students get in trouble for having their phones during the day, but if it was allowed they would not get in trouble. Also kids are going to use their phones anyway whether its a rule or not. But if we were allowed to use them during free time we would be thankful for being able to use them at all and would not text during class and respect the rule.

My last reason for supporting the idea of having cell phones during school is that it could help us students be more organized. If a friend is borrowing a calculator or something and we need it, we can text each other to meet in a certain spot instead of trying to search the school for one person. Personally I keep my daily schedule on my phone so if I have to get together with a group for a project I can check my phone during lunch and let them know when we can all get together. Also a phone's calendar would be an ideal place for students to write due dates because they will look at their phone everyday and get the notice of an approaching due date.

I feel very strongly about giving us the privilege of using our cell phones during lunch and free time. I think it would be a very good decision on your part and will benefit out students well. Less students will get in trouble, parents will be notified q
