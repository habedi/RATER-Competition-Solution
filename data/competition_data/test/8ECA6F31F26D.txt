Now that we are more advanced in technology each and every day people want to have the latest iPhone, watch or even car. We have advanced technology a lot and by a lot it is so much that car companies are starting to manufactor driverless cars. Yes, that sounds good for when you do nott want to drive but have to go somewhere but not all the time. By " driving " a driverless car comes a few risks of the technology failing on you while driving, less attention to the roads, and forgetting how to drive.

The author states in paragraph 9 that, " If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufactor?" The author is right who do you think would be more in trouble or at fault the company or the driver. Yes, the driver can sew the company but the odds are not likely of winning that, because the driver assummed all the risks of getting into a wreck when you first bought it.

Another reason why driverless cars are not good are because the person driving the car will pay less attention on the road. They will think that since it's a driverless car that nothing will affect them. Their are some drivers that might still pay attention to what is in front of them but again what if another person is not and the technology fails.

You may even forget how to drive can you believe that. No, because you do not think that you will forget that; however that just may happen. By driving a driverless car you will not be the one driving it will be the car itslef. You will not be able to control it how you want it to. In paragraph 10 the author states, " Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time." he says 90 percent of the time in just 2016 but later on will it be all up to 100 percent?

Now that we are more advanced in technology the dreams of people that thought that something could not be invented now can all thanks to the greater technology. Television and movies have been in love with the new and improved cars that can drive themselves and go fast. The viewers see them and want them and start planing for them in the futre. Do not get me wrong who would not like cars that would drive themselves when we have to go somwhere but do not want to drive. It would be nice to go somwhere far and not have to drive but not all the time. Driverless cars would be great for most part but then think of the risks of having one.
