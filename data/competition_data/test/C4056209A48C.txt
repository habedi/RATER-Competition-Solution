For centuries, the traditional form of education anywhere was learning in a classroom environment with a couple of other people. However, with the recent developments of technology in the past decade, it is now possible to receive an education at home while still being in a classroom. Although the classroom is only virtual, all of the functions of a traditional classroom still exist, and students will all be able to comfortably learn from their own computer. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they can have a better schedule, learn in a more suitable environment, and have increased productivity and progress.

Getting an education at home will allow for students to have a better schedule. For example, Generic_Name typically drives to school as his location is too distant from the rest of his classmates to be receiving bus services. The ride takes about half an hour, but due to a high concentration of traffic, Generic_Name has to wake up very early to avoid it and still get to school on time. With an online education option, Generic_Name would be able to get some more sleep instead of waking up over an hour before school begins, not have to endure the long drive back after school ends, as well as save some money on the amount of gas he has to use. Another student, Generic_Name, is a busy student athlete with a part time job. She has a tight schedule and time is an aspect of her life that she could definitely use more of. Being able to learn at home will save a lot of her time, as processes such as passing time, flex/homeroom periods, and drills for bus evacuation, natural disasters, and lock downsÂ are no longer necessary for her to go through. Also, in most online education programs, progress is usually based on own initiative when learning, so if Generic_Name works hard she can breeze through her schoolwork easily, without having to endure the long lectures and time consuming PowerPoint lessons. The current daily school schedule wastes a lot of time and lots of it can be saved for other things.

School from home gives students the ability to learn in a more suitable environment. One student, Generic_Name, has a leg disability and walking around school grounds is a difficult task for him. With online classes, Generic_Name will be able to not have to endure the difficulty of climbing stairs or using slow elevators. Him and other students will have their own seating arrangements instead of the uncomfortable upright chairs that the school has to offer. In another example, Generic_Name is a cheerful girl on the outside, but inside she has anxiety in situations she is not comfortable with and when she has to utilize her social skills. A large classroom environment is a daily struggle for Generic_Name, but with online learning she will be able to learn by herself in a controlled environment. Instead of coming into social contact, the most she would be engaging in is talking to her teacher. The best of a student can be brought out if he/she is working in an environment they are comfortable in.

Online education can increase a student's productivity. Generic_Name does well in school, but her sleep schedule and personal needs can interfere with her progress at times. As mentioned earlier, with a better schedule comes more sleep, and Generic_Name can listen to lectures without being tired or half-asleep. Her personal needs, such as going to the bathroom and having snacks, are immediately accessible and she can fulfill her needs at any point and time while continuing to learn. One student named Generic_Name has ADHD and it is difficult for him to pay attention consistently in traditional school. When it comes to lectures, he tends to stare into space and occasionally fall asleep. With online education, Generic_Name is able to be more successful as most educational programs and applications are designed to keep students paying attention by being more interactive and rewarding. This modern age of education utilizes many new concepts and students can benefit from its simplicity and convenience.

Some argue that online education does not aid with real world applications that cannot be taught, such as social skills, early wake up times, and more. Mental health should be prioritized, the school system should not force students to struggle relentlessly if it can be afforded. A student's schedule will be improved, as lots of time will be saved and transportation will no longer be needed to get to school. Students will be able to learn in a more suitable environment, being able to comfortably work and not have to engage in mass social contact. Students will see increased productivity, with more sleep and by utilizing online education applications that help students learn better than the traditional form of learning. Society should not deny the technology that has the ability to improve the everyday lives of the people and the future of the generation currently being educated will benefit from being able to learn from home.
