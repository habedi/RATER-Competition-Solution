The ability to be able to read students emotions can be helpful and cool but it can also be redundant. The ability of being able to see what emotions of others is something that occurs in us almost natually, but being able to tell exactly how someone feels about something can help people such as psychologists or teachers extreamly. Being able to see what students think about a lesson or about a video they are watching in school can be quite helpful.

If a teacher or some type of educater is able to recieve information about how someone feels, it could help the teacher see if the student actually enjoys the lesson or is at least interested by it. The ability of being able to tell how a student is thinking could change the way of how figuring out emotional information about the student and help the teachers improve on their work and teachings. But this technology could be creepy for some users. The ability to know if a person likes an add off of a website also means that their face is being displayed for someone or something to see it. A lot of people won't like that idea or not like the ability of doing so to be right or normal.

The ability of being able to see how people are thinking with technology may help in some situations. But the human mind is already programed to tell these certain characteristics about other people, so the use of using technology to help could be quite redundant. Teachers are able to tell of a student isn't enjoying a lesson if the student is either sleeping, yawning, or looking bored. The use of technology to show human emotions can help in some ways for people, but it's not worth using technology for.
