It is so amazing out her. I am sailing on the Atlantic Ocean. I have been on this sea for the nineth time. I thought all of my atemtes were fun but my last vouage was the best.

On my second atempted I serced as watchman. I think it is so awesome because I am going to be 18 years old when we reach Greece so I could help in the war! UNRRA hired " Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. Don and I even signed up so that is going to be even better.

We got the seamans papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece-with acargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed all the horses. I felt really besy all the nine voyages I took out there to Greece. My job was to check on the animals every hour.

I really do hope that you want to go too becuase it was the best thing I ever did and I think I should go again this year and next year. I was so glad that Don and me signed up for helping the other "Seagoing Cowboys"

with all of the animals. I hope I can write another story next year.
