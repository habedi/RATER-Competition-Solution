Did you know nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year?

Losing your life over having a cellphone in your hand or trying to respond to a text that can wait is not worth your life. It is not that serious to ruin someone else's life and yours to send a text back to your homeboy saying your on the way. Stop signs maybe but while driving of course not.

Using your cell phone on the road is nothing to play with. Driving without a phone in your hand is hard enough. You have to focus on your surroundings and other people driving is hard enough. I think I can speak for everyone when I say stuff can happen right before your eyes. That means as soon as you look down to send a text back to your girlfriend you can be in a ditch or through a building as soon as you look up. I feel like there should be more technology that can help people use their devices on the go. But the way it is looking now in the world it does not need to be addressed at this moment.

Moving on, I feel like people should not be able to have their phones active while driving. And music should not be played loud enough to where they can't hear the outside world. Personally I don't like how people do that. It is dangerous to others and themselves. But more phone laws should be introduced because that is way too many deaths to be comfortable with. I don't want to be known at my funeral for being killed all because I was texting a friend.

InConclusion, phone laws are looked over in the country today. If we want to cut down on these deaths we need to take action on the little issues that are called cell phones.
