You think the face on Mars was formed by aliens? I could see why. Conspiracy theorists are everywhere. I am here to explain to you why you are wrong. You see, I have some very valuable information. If you have ever seen the "Middle Buttle", in the Snake River plain of Idaho, you would really see the resemblance towards the face of the moon and the Buttle. Though, this could just be coincidence.

For all of you out there who think that NASA is trying to hide information from you, if that was the case, you would not know about the face of mars. If we did in fact know if the face was crated by other life forms, aka "aliens", NASA would be blabbing it's mouth about it everywhere. That would make NASA'S popularity grow and be better for them all around, so why hide something that will help us?

This supposed face has brought along alot of good things, such as, starring in Hollywood films, appearing in books and magazines, and even being discussed on talk shows. With every good thing there is bad things, unfortuately. There are people saying NASA is hiding information and making up other wild conspiracy theories.

Though, this does not make sense considering when we first spotted the image of the face in 1976, we sexposed it to the world. I do not understand how that is hiding anything. Over the years, NASA has tried getting Viking 1 to get better images of the face, and succeeding. Viking 1 got better images in 1998 and 2001. The face is extermely hard to find, located on Cyndonia, you can only find it some days. Now when NASA spends so much time trying to get better images for the people, that sorta rings a bell, maybe saying there is no hdden information.

Now, like I said in the beginning, any information or evidence at all would definetly help NASA, so why hide it?
