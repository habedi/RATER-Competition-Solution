Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Why is attending an in school courses a beneficial way ? Learning from school helps a student to be more beneficial because, it helps a person be more fast with their work because they know there is a dead line .And learning in school helps work in a destructive area or environment and help you learn how to be more focused. But attending classes from home by online is a convenient way for others because it's less stressful and help with the focus and with less destruction or disturbances, it helps finish more work than an in school attender. Benefits now would be that a student attending in school would know time management and can learn the ability to work through distractions or any disturbances. Although students at home taking online classes would probably be more dependent and have better grades,it should be known that every student or kid should have the accessibility to a social and an interactive life and some skill that needs to be picked up by a person or student and the responsibilities of growing up.

And a way to interact with other as in social skills. Benefits later would be an a student attending online classes can be ahead of students in school and start an early career but would lack the ability for social skills and also an online class taker would be more dependent on their self.

Students who go to in school to take classes are more experienced because they've had the guidance of most teachers and counselors to help them get through the hardship and with all the problems that students go through also even though students who take courses online at home might get a head start at a career they might probably lack the skill of advice and the knowledge that an in school student might have. Because a student in school might have learnt that in careers you need to be social on time and even maybe work overtime or even work ahead of time to be successful because an online class taker had all the time to finish every work the lack of efficiency would not be a skill an online class taker would have. A student who take classes in school would most likely most be OK with working over time and a home course learner might deny the request.

Students who stay home to learn by taking online courses might have some skill that an in school student might not have like the stay home student is gonna have to be more dependent on self because they would have to depend on their self to do everything without the help of an expert. As in the act of careers the student that take courses can be more responsible and dependent on to work on other stuff even though the student that was in school would have that skill the student that took online classes might have it even more because they never had any help ever they would be more experienced.

The benefits in taking an in school course is very useful in every kids life because it help with the most important skill being social skill it makes a person more used to the different behaviors of people and how to go about certain situations and how to solve them and also the skill to work in any destructive situations no matter what the situation is you should able cancel it out and focus on the real work thats important to you in the situation also some other benefits are in physical education, student might have a passion for some kind of sport being participated in school and can join teams and other resourceful meeting that can helping that kind of career but an online class student that stay home can never join a team to figure out their future because they would never have a chance in trying it out .And a student in school can also learn from others mistakes around other students and make sure they never repeat the same mistakes. A student staying home to take online classes will never have a chance to learn from others mistakes because well they would be home with no social life and no regrets in no bad decisions.

Although students at home taking online classes would probably be more dependent on their self and have better grades, it should be known that every student or kid should have the accessibility to a social interactive life and some skills that needs to be picked up by a student or some responsibility of growing up. Staying home and taking courses has it's perks but it also a bad decision because the child could lack all the responsibilities needed in the near future. it could help with lots like self dependent . While student that go to in school have more experience and then some that a stay home online class taker might be missing like the responsibility of owning to your mistakes , learning from others mistakes u can learn to work in destructive surroundings and have all the social skills needed and try out for your own career in whether it's physical skills or hands on.
