Dear state senator,

Electoral College shouldn't even be used anymore because it is widely regarded as an anachronism. In the Electoral College it's the electors who elect the president not the people. People should be able to vote for the president they want and not have electors elect the president. If the electors are electing the president they want then why even let the people vote only for them to be disappointed. Also when voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College other then there lack of democratic pedigree.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote wouldn't be the first since it has already happened in 2000. The reason is the the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney. Cause almost all states award electoral votes and a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number but this is highly unlikely.

Overall you will decide what is best for this state but just take in mind my idea how the Electoral doesn't benefit the people nor you.

Sincerly, a citizen who cares.
