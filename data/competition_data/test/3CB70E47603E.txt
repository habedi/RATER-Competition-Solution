This kind of technology could prove to be quite useful but at the same time it could prove to be annoying. So to me i'm like half against it and the other half is with this type of technology. Like i said there are pros and cons about this type of stuff. For example like what they said in the story "If you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." you can find this an paragraph 6 line 3 to 5.

I say this because what if someone is trying to hide something not bad but something that is personal to the makes them deppresed or sad and they don't want to talk about it but the advance technology might know and it might notify the teacher or someone else. Then that could be bothersome because then that person will keep asking him/her if he/she is alright but that is only if the technology notify's techers. But then again it could prove to be quit useful like what if a kid needs help but they don't want to talk even though deep down they want to talk to someone but they just don't know who that person is.

This technology can show thing like when a studet is bored or confused and is something similar to what Dr. huand predicts might happen "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.".

So my conclusion is that no matter what there is always going to be a good and bad side to different technology's. you may get good results one day but the next someting mght happen because of it. Their is awlays going to be consequences for some advance tech. So i will say it again I am in niether side i'm more in the middle then anything else.
