In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because in this passage the author says, "Astronomers are facsinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." This shows that the author supports this idea because he finds it interesting that Venus could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Another reason why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents would be that in the last passage it states, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained onthe planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." This paragraph states that we shouldn't only limit ourselves to just the Earth, but we should travel beyond that. The author also states that we shouldn't limit ourselves because of dangers and doubts but it should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

In conclusion in "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the author finds it interesting and because the author also believes that we shouldn't limit ourselves just because of dangers and doubts. But instead the author believes that we should expand our imagination and innovation.
