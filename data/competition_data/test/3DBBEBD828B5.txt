Dear Principal,

Changing school policy so students with c grades that need b grades are not able to play a school sport is a bad idea.

Some kids may have a problem with math or science or social studies or English that doesn't mean you shouldn't stop them from sports.

Its a good way of exercise and they could go on to be great players.

They are atleast trying their hardest to get their work done and get the highest grade they can get but it can be hard for them.

If a student is smart and you know it and they aren't try to the best of their abilities i could se why you would do that.

I myself am like that, but atleast a c is passing and you would like to see someone succeed wouldn't you? I know i would that would make me very happy.

A sport to me is like my life my life revolves around sports and exercise with friends.

I'm not always available out of school so i use the school activities and sports to hang out with my friends and stay active. If you take sports away from a kid who is very fit but doesn't do good in school they could become slackers and give up in live and not be as fit as they were before.

So i'm here speaking for all my friends and me we would like for you to reconsider what you are thinking you could regret it someday in your life. Plus students could stop trying in school or drop out. So just reconsider your thoughts.

Sincerely,
