Dear Principle:

It is my understanding that you have decided to change the school policy. I do not agree because all students should have the opportunity to participate in sports. All students should have the chance to decide if they want to participate in sports even if they have a C average grade. There has never been a grade requirement for sports because all kids have the ability to play.

All students have the ability to play because you don't need to Math or English to play soccer or any other sport.

Kids just play to have fun. Students from many different cultures interact and learn when they are playing. I understand that studies come first but what if your child had a C average? I am sure that you would want him/her to have fun and play any sport they want to play and have fun with their friends.

Thank you for your time. If you want to talk more about this idea please contact me at PHONE_NUMBER.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
