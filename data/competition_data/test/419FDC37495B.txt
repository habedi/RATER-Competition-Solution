My principal TEACHER_NAME is considering changing school policy so that students like me and other students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have at least a grade B average. Most of the students here have a grade C average.

TEACHER_NAME I think you shouldn't considering changing school policy that we cant play in school activities because we need a B average and Most of the students here have a grade C average

I mean I can understand if there failing there core classes like Science, Math, Social Studies and other classes that really counts. I think if we have a grade C average and we keep it up to a C or higher I think we are good.

Here are some other things like we should be coming to school to get are education and not play around like during on are own time then we can like lunch and outside. But when we are in the class room we need to stay focus and keep are grades up. TEACHER_NAME, 'What I'm saying is that I understand that you want are students to have good grades. If they have a grade C average you shouldn't take school activities and sports away because they don't have a grade B average just tell them that they need to keep there grade up. If it goes down to a D or a F then they shouldn't be in activities because they need to be focus on there school work first before they are in school activities and sports. That's what I'm talking about I understand if they have a D or a F but a grade C average they just need to keep it up to a C or a B average and a

A that would even be better.
