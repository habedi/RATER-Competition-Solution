The article " Driverless Cars Are Coming" poses both the positive and negative aspects of the developement of driverless cars. The developement of these cars does seem useful but it seems that they would cause more prolems than solutions. The public transportation system is fine as it is.

The developement of these driverless cars poses a lot of potenetial issues. Some of these issues include safety and the law. Driverless cars could pose safety issues. The technology could fail and cause potential disasters. Driverless cars in regards to the law could cause trouble. The article gives the example " If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?" New laws would be needed to cover liability in case of an accident as such. A lot of the traffic laws would need to change to fit the new way of transportation as well.

Although the negative aspects out-weigh the positives, there are still some good things about the developement of these cars. One thing the article mentions is that they would only use about half of the fuel today's cars do. While that is a good thing these cars still pose greater problems. They say they will be safer, but what if the technology fails? This type of technology puts people at risk.

In conclusion, these driverless cars of the future are potentially dangerous. They would cause problems with the law and they pose safety concerns. Their developement poses little to no positive aspects. The world would be better off if they ceased the developement of these cars.
