Being apart of the UNRRA is fun for those who join because,"besides helping people i had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China." also it takes about two weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast. Also, it takes a month to get to China. that gives him you alot of time to sight see.

On the way to the destination you will have alot of responcibilities like the animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats were given to the animals every day. Yes it has alot of responsibilities. However,when they are on there way back to the place they got shipped of from they had a lot of time to play around since they where done like,"The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds that the animals been housed . table tennis tournaments , fencing, boxing, reading ,wittling,and games also helped pass the time."

If you join the UNRRA you chould have the experience of a lifetime,because it was a opportunity of a lifetime for luke just as it could be for you. Luke was the first person to make nine trips,you might be the second. However,that is only if you decide to join the UNRRA. It will be fun for you if you join the Sea going Cowboys. Also while you are on the boat you get to see alot of the world,so you better go join up before they run out of space.
