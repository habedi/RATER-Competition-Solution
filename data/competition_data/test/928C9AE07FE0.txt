Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this letter to argue with our schools policy change.

I believe that this is a horrible policy and it is asking to much from the student athletes at our school.

I do believe that all student should do well in school and that our teachers and parents expect highly from us.

However, I think that a B average is way to much to ask for.

If the students have C averages that means that they are proficient at all levels and subjects.

Asking them to be more then proficient is not the biggest problem but the fact that if they were trying their best then they couldn't do any better.

You can not do better then your best.

I do understand that playing sports for our school is a privilege, and that they are student athletes, and that being a student always comes first, but asking for more then your best is to much.

So that is why I think that asking for someone's best is what the school policy should be. Asking for someone's best should be the school policy because everyone in our school is smart enough to earn a C average.

So if every student gives their best then every student will be eligible to play sports with a C average or higher.

Also I believe that it is harder for students that play sports to earn a B average in school mainly because they have much harder schedules to work with.

Their schedules are much harder because they have less time for their studies and they also must be devoted to sports and school as well.

They have less time because they need to go to practices after school, and games as well.

So that takes time out of their day to study.

Also if they were to get all of their studying and schoolwork done they will not get to sleep until late at night and they won't get as much sleep as someone who doesn't play sports.

Less sleep also means that they won't be able to concentrate as easily in class.

Once again I think that what your asking for is too much and not everyone is capable of reaching those goals of a B average. However, I do believe that everyone in this school is capable of at least a C average. As long as everyone in our school tries there best it will happen, and that is all you can ask for.

So that is why i believe that our school policy should be changed back to needing a C average to be eligible to play sports.

I hope that you take my points to consideration.

Thank You

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
