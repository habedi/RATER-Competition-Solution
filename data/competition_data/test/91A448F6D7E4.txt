There are many advantages of limiting car usage around big cities, not just pollution. For example there is more excerise involved in comuting back and forth from work to home or school. Think of all the possibilites by not having to use a car, you get to meet new people that you wouldnt if you just drove, you could save money on gas to help pay bills.

The reasons for driving is that there are many miles of distance between you and your destination and your running late, or there is also a possiblility of you being to lazy to walk anywhere. When did people in general from all around the world gets so lazy? I say this because if you live in a compacted city like new york or paris, everything is basically within walking distance and if no there are subways and trams to help. I understand if your way out into the country why you need car cause there is nothing you can really do but city peoples should at least try to limit you car usage.

I believe that what paris did was right, by prohibiting car usages for 5 days. They were at very high levels of pollution in the city and it drastically decreased once they stopped car usage all over the city. Many people may not have been happy about getting find but they can defenetly breathe better. Also vauban in germany is on the right track if they are heading for being green. I think people should listen to these few countries and help make this planet accessibly livable.
