Using the technology in class would be valuable in classrooms. Using the new technology can help students stay focused or help them become more interested in school. The technology can also make the class more interesting if it picks up that the person is bored or whatever the case might be. This technology can change the way students think about school.

In the 6th paragraph it says "A classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This quote shows that this technology could change the way students interact with school and change their feelings about school. If the student is bored the computer will pick up on it nd make the assignment something more interesting which will change their mood into happy. If the student is becoming confused the computer wil pick up on that and will try to make it more easier and/or explain it in a more simplier way.

In conclusion, the technology would be a good idea because it could make assignments on computers more easier to understand. It could possibly improve students grades if it knows what to do to make it easier on the student. Lastly, it could possibly get students to want to be more invloved in school and participate in the lesson more.
