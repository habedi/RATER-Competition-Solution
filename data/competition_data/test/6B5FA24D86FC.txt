Dear Principal,

As a student, of course, I would not agree with the "no cell phone policy." Students are always on there phone's, and quite recently, there have been several incidents regarding a cell phone. examples like: texting in class, the phones going off in class and being a disruption. I do understand your concern for a change. IF you do allow policy 1 (allow the students to bring the phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.) I believe there should be some modifications involved.

I am in agreement to both policies, but I am more along the lines of policy one. Policy one is stating that the use of cell phones are okay to be using in school to a minimum. I am concerned that students would take advantage of this offer, so minor consequences should be involved, example: referral. Another concern I have is if the students forget or do not have time to turn off and back on there cell phones between passing periods. I am not concerned about the lunch period however, you have about thirty minutes to make sure your cell phone is turned OFF before entering a classroom.

Technology is at it's greatest in this century, there is practically every device you could think of. Including a device that will ruin reception in the classroom. If the student's phone is not turned off before entering the classroom, it would be no use to use, the device would cut all reception. I do believe this should be placed in every classroom. This will cut all worries of your phone going off in class or a disruption from a text.

Although it may lower all those causes, it will also lower the amount of referrals being given out to the students who do chose to text in class and get caught. As for the students who do have there phone's out and get caught with them, a referral should be given.

I do not think phone's should be allowed during passing periods. You will have at least five minutes to turn your phone on, send a text or two, and turn it back on, and still be on time to class. I think it will cut into passing time. You will see a trend of students being late to there class because they are caught up in sending a text rather than being focused to get to class on time.

With a few perfecting modifications, I do in fact believe this policy will be do-able. I am in full agreement with the policy, with the changes applied. Phones should be located on the student incase of any emergency, they will be able to contact parent/guardian or 911. Regardless, I do NOT agree with policy 2 in ANY way.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
