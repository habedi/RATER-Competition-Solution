Dear Mr. Principle,

I believe that students should be required to perform community service. Community service provides many opportunities to students to try something new. With community service students can make new friends, help the people in their community, and help deal with problems in the community.

To begin with the students can make new friends through the program. Some students don't do community service because they think it will take away from their own personal time. What they don't know is that through community service they can meet new people and make new friends that they wouldn't have known otherwise. Doing the service doesn't have to be a big deal, they can do something small for the community, like taking out an older persons garbage or feeding their animals would be fine. That way the students would have time for friends or their own personal life.

Furthermore, students can help the people in their community. Through community service students can meet people in their community that can't get away from their home.

Community service can help the homebound and teach the students responsibility and how to care for other people. The people that usually don't get to see many people because they are stuck at home would probably enjoy having company even if it is only once or twice a week. The students that don't want to do community service would learn valuable lessons that they probably couldn't learn at school, and it would get them out into the world where they would learn new things.

Finally, the students could learn how to deal with problems in the community, like littering. Community service not only helps the students get out in the community, but it also helps the community. Typically when you see a piece of paper or wad of trash on the side of the road you just ignore it, right? With community service people can help clean up the community. Those students who just sit at home would have something to do on a Saturday morning. Instead of just looking at the piece of trash we can pick it up and help make the community a better place! Even if other students don't want to help, they can, required service isn't a death sentence! The students can survive with out T.V. for a half an hour to help clean up the parks or the community since in the long run it would help the community as a whole.

This is why community service should be required, because it not only helps the community, but it helps the students. The students that are unwilling can make new friends, help the people in their community, and help deal with problems in the community. I believe that community service is very important for us students and for the community.

Sincerely,
