The sea going Cowboys is a good program! It's adventurous and fun. You can do a lot of fun things in the sea going cowboy program . If you join you will have a blast ! You can learn things , and also see alot of cool things while traveling and experience unique things. Maybe I can even show you around the boat a little.

One reason to join the sea going cowboy clubs is you can see cool places while traveling. Maybe even collect some cool items you find on the ship or even souvenirs from other states , countries and villages . You can also see cool statue like Statue of Liberty if we ever go to New York again . Once I got to tour an excavated castle in Crete .

Second reason you should join cowboys club is you can meet new people , and make new friends . In many countries,states and villages there are different people like in age , race , and language. While rest stoping in villages some families don't have as much so you should give respect and show them you come with peace . While your in certain places you can learn different cultures , religions , tradition .

According to the story our boat carrys animals because UNRRA hired us too . Taking care of animals isn't hard at all , feed them , clean them , clean there pens , and that's it three easy steps . Some animals might be pregnant so we will have to double feed them and watch them for signs of birth. The baby's will be easy to take care of most of the time because they will stay with there mothers for 4 weeks then separate them .

Joinging the sea going Cowboys will be the best choice you make . You can go on fun trips learn stuff culturals from countries,city and states . Maybe learn some different languages along the way . You can get souvenirs and maybe even tells some stories to kids about all your trips , best of luck hope ou join our program .
