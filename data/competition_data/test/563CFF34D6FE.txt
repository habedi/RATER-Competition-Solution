The author makes a claim by telling how venus is a worthy pursuit. If we went to go visit venus,we would learn everything about what lived or growed on venus. But,If you were to go,you would have to watch out for carbon dioxide blankets,and highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus also has the hottest has the surface tempature than any other planet in our solor system. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. If you were able to see venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safetly far ablove the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likelly lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. I thoink it would be a great idea to visit venus and find out things that happend on it a long time ago,but we need to get the right protection to visit venus before we examine it.
