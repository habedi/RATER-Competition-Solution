To Whom It May Concern.

Students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students will not pay attention if they will be a home schoolers, students will be distracted by their phone or video game, and when students are taking a test.

First, students will not pay attention if they will be home schoolers, For example students are going to do something else instead paying attntion to what the teacher are saying, However, if their parents are going to be strict with them asking for their grade every time.

Second, Students are going to be distracted by their phone or video game, for example home schoolers are going to be always at their phone, a teacher wll not be avle to see the if they on their phone, Unlike attending to a school is better for a students to learn more.

Third, when students are taking a test, For example students can easly get the answer from internet, teacher will not be able to care about them if they are getting the answers from internet, However if the put several time to finsh the test it will be short time for the students to find the answer, and it will be more quickly to finsh the test.

In conclusion, Home schoolers have to attend a public school because they will learn more than staying watching video conferencing which will be harder to understand, its not the same going to school and staying home, staying home is spending time, going to school learning more, and it will be able to understand more because tecahers will expalin personality
