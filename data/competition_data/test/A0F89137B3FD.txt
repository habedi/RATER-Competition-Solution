The author well supports their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers. They give evidence supporting the importance of Venus's past, its general beneficiality, and how it could positively affect our future.

Exploring Venus is useful because its past is similar to Earth's present state. The passage states that Venus is closest to Earth in density and size, then that "astromomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." By exploring the planet and its past, more understanding on its inhospitable fall would be known, and potentially used in the research of space travel and comprehension. Since Venus and Earth were so similar, it is likely that at some point Earth will have the same result as its sister planet.

Studying Venus also offers general beneficiality to space research. In the passage it says that Venus is occasionally the closest in distance to Earth. Because the distance is the shortest, the time neccessary to travel to, and thus, get feedback from, is also the shortest. Whether that be general information about interplanetary travel or information specific to Venus itself, the quickness alotted due to the distance is very useful since traveling in space has a very large time scale.

The future of technology and inhabitants on Earth can greatly improve with the study of Venus. By creating technology durable enough to withstand the intense weather and atmospheric conditions of Venus, it could prove to be durable enough for other planets that we could colonize. The author describes Venus's conditions as, ". . .temperatures averaging over 800 degreen Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric preassure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." To create machines and substances that can withstand these circumstances can be used for a multitude of things, both on Earth and in space.

The author has clearly proven that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through these points, and more. Much evidence was given like general facts or statistics, along with a series of inferences that explain how Venus has the potential to be a large benefactor in interplanetary travel.
