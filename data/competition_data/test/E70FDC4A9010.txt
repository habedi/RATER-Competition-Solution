Dear Principle

I agree with the decision to change the C average to a B average to be eligible for any extra curricular activities, because it may increase the over all effort of a schools performance. It may even be a step to encourage more effort in the classroom, and of the person themselves to be a better person.

Changing the school policy might result in viewer students trying out for sports or other extra curricular activities. There might be an increase in a students effort in school to do better, due to the fact if they do not have the required grades, they may not join any activities. I believe that grades might even improve in the overall class average. It may also help to encourage more students to do extra curricular activities that can motivate students to do their best in school. It may even be good to encourage this now by keeping their good grades, so that later in life they may

Changing the school policy might serve as a motivator to other students, to do better in school. To get the best effort out of any student, you require a very good motivator. Sports or other activities that might help their future, will get more students to do their best efforts. It will especially help those students if the motivator is something that is fun and if it is something they love to do.

It will be very good to change the policy because it will bring out the best of ever student to do better in school. Students will do better if they have something that motivates them to do their best, to be able to do something they enjoy doing. It will not only be to the schools advantage but the students advantage as well.
