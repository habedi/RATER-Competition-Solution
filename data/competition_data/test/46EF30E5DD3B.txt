Current day, almost everyone owns a cell phone. When using a cell phone, you are easily distracted. For instance, say you are on vacation and you were looking for a restaurant on your phone and fell in the water. But, if you're easily distracted while walking, imagine how much more distracting you'd be in a car. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.

When you're driving, you not only have to be aware of yourself, but your surroundings. Including construction, other drivers, and pedestrians. Already as a driver it's hard to stay focused when you have passengers and/or playing music. Now picture you're driving down the road and see a man on his phone hit a kid on a bike and speed off afterwards. There are many safety hazards while driving and adding a phone into the equation, only adds more. Georgia has just now recently added the "Hands Free" rule to where it's illegal to be on your phone as you're driving. There are over 1.5 million car crashes a year caused from phones and over 385,000 injuries a year. So, the no phone rule is very a good addition and one of the best laws I've ever heard of.

On the other hand, some people argue that it shouldn't be a rule. They give pointless points like GPS, or "Important Phone Calls". There are easy fixes to these. If you are worried about getting an important call, connect your phone to your Bluetooth on your car. If your car doesn't have Bluetooth, whenever someone calls, you could just put it on speaker. For the GPS part, all you have to do it get a device that'll hold your phone for you. It allows you to see any calls, messages, or the GPS. There are many fixes for why not to have this law, but no good reason on why it shouldn't be a law.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to hold their phone personally in their hand while driving. If that means zero access in some places, then so be it. It's not worth someone losing their life because you wanted to text someone back or talk to your significant other. But, if have a device that holds it for you is allowed, that they be a win-win for everyone. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.
