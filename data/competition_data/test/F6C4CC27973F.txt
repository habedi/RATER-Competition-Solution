It has been estimated that during summer break, roughly 75 percent of students fail to retain critical information for their next year's classes. This is quite detrimental to a student's overall education, considering time will have to be spent relearningÂ old information instead of new material. Because of this, some schools require students to complete summer projects, with the goal of keeping students learning even during their break. These summer projects should be created by teachers, enhancing the concept that authority plays a role in maintaining steady educational progress.

Teachers are far more familiar with the curriculum than students. Teachers have spent years in the education system and know best how to prepare students for success in that environment. Teachers will on average spend four to five years attaining a degree in education, and will then spend the majority of their working years in the school system. Having spent so much time in and around the school system, they will have become incredibly familiar with the curriculum. This inherently generates an unparalleled level of experience with the material which teachers can effectively utilize to create projects that will better fit the education of their students.

Teachers are more suited to designing projects that will relate to the next year's material. The majority of students do not know exactly what to expect heading into their next year of education. Specifically, one may know that they are taking calculus next year, but they will not know the level of importance past information holds in the upcoming class. Teachers, who have been dealing with the material surrounding their class for years, know all that which is relevant to the class, and how to design a project that will suit the necessary concepts. Because of the fact that teachers have spent so much time around the curriculum, by nature they will create projects which are far more effective in helping students retain or even learn new information during the summer break.

Some believe that students should be the ones to design their summer assignments; however, this belief is faulty. Humans, and students especially, tend to live by the motto, "Work smarter, not harder." If given free reign or even partial credit in designing a summer project, the final product will be something so elementary that the students might as well have done nothing at all. Consider how students more often than not take advantage of late work deadlines, then think of how that might translate into the creation of a summer project. A summer project is not to be taken lightly, the whole point for its existence is to retain and potentially improve upon information learned last which will be critical for next year. Students will naturally take the easy way out on a summer project, and need an authority figure, namely a teacher, who is experienced enough in the curriculum to create a project for them.

Teachers have an unrivaled level of experience in creating projects. A teacher's whole day is concerned with illustrating new concepts and ideas, and figuring out creative ways to demonstrate them. Teachers will on average create about 80-100 different lessons, tests, study guides, and projects. Through all of this they will obtain vital information on how to structure these assignments in ways that will effectively stimulate the students learning. With all the experience a teacher gains from having created so many projects before, they will be able to create an excellent summer project that will keep their students in good shape for their upcoming classes.

Teachers are far better suited to creating summer assignments because of the need for authority in educational success. In all the aforementioned reasoning, one thing has remained clear, that teachers, the older and more experienced party, are unquestionably better suited to designing summer projects. Subordinate students will naturally create easy assignments that would minimize the required effort, especially since the project is to be completed over the summer break. Teachers; however, wouldn't necessarily create needlessly arduous projects, simply ones that would require the students to think on a high level. The necessity of an authority figure in education is paramount, and the importance of the teacher in designing summer projects is just an extension of that concept.
