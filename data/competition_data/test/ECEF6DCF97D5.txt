Venus is the planet with the most similarities to our planet Earth. Venus is most definitely something worth exploring it is similar to our planet earth, it is dangerous, and it is just fascinating to explore different places.

Venus is very much alike our planet earth Astronomers think that long ago Venus was covered in oceans and could have supported life. Venus also has many planet like structures for example valleys, mountains, craters, and much more. In pragraph 4 it says "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth today... The planet has a surface of rocky sedimemt and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." That shows how Earth and Venus are so much alike.

Even though Venus is so much alike Earth it is way more dangerous. For example Venus temperature is way hotter than our temperature becaus it is closer to the sun and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to. I know that Planet Venus is a dangerous planet because in paragraph 3 it says "A thick atmoshphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosohere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greaterthan what we experience on our own planet" This proves that the conditions on Planet Venus is far to dangerous for us humans to be able to withstand.

With that being said Astronomers and scientists still believe it is worth exploring Venus because it is such a fasncinating planet. Astronomers still want to explore this planet more because it is the planet that is the closet to being just like our planet Earth with the most similarities than any other planet in our whole solar system. I know this because on Paragraph 4 it talks about the similarities between venus and earth, it also says that the astronomers are fascinated with Venus. "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." that shows that Astronomers think it's worth exploring.

Planet Venus is mos definitely a very fascinating planet, is very similar to our planet Earth, and also very dnagerous for us humans. But is it worth exploring?
