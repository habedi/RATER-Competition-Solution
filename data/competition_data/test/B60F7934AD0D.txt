"Ahhhh!" RELATIVE_NAME had a sudden fall on the recess cement. First you heard a crack, and the a boom! It was like a bomb has just exploded it was very unexpected. In about a second RELATIVE_NAME flung up and ran away. Everybody suddenly simply stared startled at her fall. Now imagine students had their phone during that little action. You would hear snapshots all over the place, feeling like you were on the red carpet. Phones must be banned during all times of the school day, even recess and lunch. How unlucky would it be for poor RELATIVE_NAME if pictures of her got around? My principal should not allow phones at all, it can lead to violence, bullying, and distraction.

How would you feel if you were being the number one thing being talked about through an electronic device? It is difficult enough in the evening where a lot of fighting starts through phones, but during school is a big mistake. First you hear a punch and then a scream. "Oww!" STUDENT_NAME screamed when STUDENT_NAME punched him as if he was a pillow, went right through him. the cause of this fight was over text when student's rumored STUDENT_NAME wanted to fight which set STUDENT_NAME on the loose. Calling and texting during lunch, recess, and free times will be a big regret for the principal. Students can use their phones to cause fist fights, and harming themselves. It puts a lot of students in danger and risk.

When was the last time you heard the word bully? Advisory class, the police department, language arts class, the news, everywhere that word is being talked about and used. Well with cell phones during school this word will become a large increase. Being in use and talked about. It is a proven fact that every hour of the day a kid commits a suicide because of stuggles at school. Who would want to bring this risk to a higher level? You never know how much can spread and happen to anyone in such a short period of time at school.

The last component on which bringing cell phones into school time is such a bad idea is distraction. Normally during the day many student's now study for their afternoon science, math, french, etc. class test during recess, lunch, and free time. The usage of this electronic device will bring down grades and bring up less focus. During class even without their cellphones dream about having the device in their hands. It has become an addiction and when using it at school teachers and parents will not be happy with the results.

Bringing cellphones in school time will do nothing good besides cause even more violence, cruel bullying, and a lot of distractions. Student's will get involved with low recommended activities which will not improve student's behavior and grades. Our principal will soon see more kid's in his office and everybody's head buried into their devices not books. It is required for student's to have a good behavior and high grades in order to be involved with a lot of activities. Our school shall not be aloud to have cell phones ever during the day time.
