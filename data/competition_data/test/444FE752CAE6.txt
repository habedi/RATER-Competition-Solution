Dear State Senator,

I feel that you should keep the Electoral College. They help vote to decide the President as well as the Vice President. "The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President ."

Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Lots of states have a "winner-take-all" system. This system awards every elector to the winning presidential candidate. People would say that the Electoral College should be gone, they would say it is a disaster factor. "The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse." This was very bad, but nothing has been worse which shows that the Electoral College has been in control. Also after the elections the governor gives out a "Certificate of Ascertainment" this shows which electors will represent your state. So Mr. State Senator I hope that you dont get rid of the Electoral College.

From,
