To whom I may be Concern,

Dear, Principal I believe you should go with policy one because you may never know what might happen and I think students at least deserve to have the phones out during lunch and free period. Students should be allowed to use the phones during these times because if not, emergencies may happen and we may not know until after school is over. For some students it is very important to make a phone call at least ones during free period or lunch. One of the other reasons why they should have there phones with them in school is, in these days like now you have a lot of school shootings happening or other dangerous stuff going on, that sometimes you have to call the police. Imagine knowing your mother is going to be delivering a child and she promised to you that she will call. Now Imagine no one home and your in school and your phone is taken away from you and your mom is the only one and she calls you because she had an accident and she needs someone to call help or you to come home. I also don't agree with policy two because things happen and in these kind of cases you need the phones with you no matter what. Children's safety is very important and they should carry a phone with them. Students can use there phones during free times, and lunch but after that they must immediately shut them off and get to class.

Thank you for your

Cooperation
