Imagine you are sitting down in the cafeteria alone because you have no one to talk to, and then you hear about an interesting extracurricular activity so you sign up. That is how most students find something that they really like to do. Extracurricular activities are a way for students to explore there talents and find what they are good at and what they can improve. I believe all students should participate in an extracurricular activity because they have something to look forward to, get to make new friends, and get to try something new.

One reason reason students should do an after school activity is because it gives them something to look forward to. Most students agree that school is boring because they learn about stuff that they don't find useful. some students even drop out of school because of those reasons. However, with extracurricular activities you get to do what you want to do after the school day. Instead of people dropping out of school so they can start a music career, they can join a music club after school. Then they can work on both their academic work and perfecting their music talent without dropping out

Another reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they can make friends. Most friends people make at school are through extracurricular activities because everyone there has similar interests. At the beginning of my first year of middle school I auditioned for the middle school musical

Rock of Ages . I didn't have many friends at the beginning of the year, but I made a lot of friends through the musical who I am still friends with now.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they get to try something new. School should be about learning what this is you can do well naturally and what you might need improvement on, and this is exactly what extracurricular activities do. There are different types of activities for different types of students. You cans sign up for the school play, a sport that you like, a club that helps the environment, and countless others. If students didn't sign for an extracurricular activities they wouldn't be able to experience everything that their class mates did and they might regret their decision later.

Extracurricular activities are something every student should do because it lets them try something new, helps them make friends, and it gives them something to look forward to. Some people don't think every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities because it takes time away from students being able to spend time with family or do homework, and they are right. However, even though they will have less time to spend with their family and on homework the students will still be happy because they got to do an extracurricular activity.
