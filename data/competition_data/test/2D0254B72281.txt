Elizabeth Rosenthal gives information on Germany's car-free cities and shows her support of the idea. I belive that a car-free day as shown in

Source 2 in Paris is a good idea for two reasons. First, a single day of no use of automobiles can be extremely beneficial to the ecosystem. Second, it is shown tobe less stressful and safer to those who participate in the event.

The benefits of a car-free day far outweigh the slight inconvenience that it may bring. In the event in paris they had a 60 percent decrease in traffic congestion and before the car-free day paris had 147 micrograms of pollution in the air and after the car-free day it had a measley 79.9 microgram count, thats impressive. not to mention this is only a 24-hour event everyone can sacrifice that ammount of time for a great cause like this.

Secondly, there are several records of people claiming that they feel less stressed like citizen of Vauban, Germany, like Hiedrun Walter. No automobiles means no traffic, no loud horns or loud engines in the middle of the street. Plus, you will be able to enjoy exercise and taking a train or Taxi to you're destination which allows for a more public and social experience for those who participate, and not to mention you could be fined if you dont participate.

In conclusion, I feel that it is highly beneficial to the ecosystem to limmit car usage even if only for a day. It's a slight sacrifice for a potentialy huge gain. It can also prove to cause less stress than every day transportation that were used to.
