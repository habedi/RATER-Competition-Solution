Its a good statement on why they think they should visit Venus but its to risky. Venus might be the closest planet to Earth from density and size and sometimes the closest. The different speeds of Venus and Mars are why we are sometimes closest to Mars than we are Venus. So why not go and explore Mars it would be safer than Venus.

Humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus but Venus is all cloudy. Each and every mission was unnamed for a good reason, each of the spacecraft dissapeard after a few hours after the arrival on Venus. Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in three decades for that exact reason. It gets to hard for humans to study, considering nothing can be there for more than just a few hours and its to dangerous to land there. To land or even to see people cant because the amount of clouds that cover Venus.

On the surface of Venus tempature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than are own on Earth. Its would be way to extreme for us to even come close to even think of getting down there. And Venus has the hottest aurface temparture of any planet in our solar system although Mercury is closest to the Sun. Venus has a more likely chance of impacting Volcanoes, Powerful Earthquakes, and fequent lighting strikes. But the planet Venus used to be like Earth and it still has some features like Valleys, Mountains and craters.

So it would be way to dangerous to even try to land on venus. They were talking about a blimp like vehichle floating above the surface of Venus, even though it would still be aroud 170 degrees there. It would still be to dangerous what if something goes wrong theres always that what if. And even if it did work theres no possible way scientist could take samples of rock, gas, and plants since there not going to be doen there. They also have slight visibility up there from the clouds since no light can pass through.
