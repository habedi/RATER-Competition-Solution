Required extracurriculars

Have you ever considered joining an after school club? How about a sport? Or maybe even student council? There are many different activities to choose from that all have unique benefits. Participating in an extracurricular activity would be very beneficial because most colleges like when you have school related activities, they give you something to do, and it's an opportunity to make new friends.

When completing a college application, they'll want to know more about you. One way to show them that you're well rounded is joining clubs. It displays that you have a variety of interests. As a result, the probability of you being accepted into a certain college is increased. The more activities the better.

Not only are extracurriculars beneficial for college, but they also give you something to do. Would you rather be sitting in your bedroomÂ and staring at the wall or learning new skills and having fun? If you're more interested in the arts, then you could join theater or drama club. If you prefer being active and competitive, then you could join a sport. No matter what you decide on, you'll enjoy yourself and learn simultaneously.

Extracurriculars are an excellent opportunity to create new friendships and learn more communication skills. Everyone has one common interest and that brings people together. Finding a friend or two is very likely. By making new friends, your communication skills will certainly improve.

In conclusion, extracurriculars are very beneficial because they impress colleges, provide entertainment, and create long lasting friendships. So think about joining theater, chess club, or playing basketball.

Consider all of the benefits you may receive.
