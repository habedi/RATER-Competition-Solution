Benefits of Online Conferences in Schools

Let's make a change that all schools in the United States have to follow. All schools should allow students the option for video conferences. Some schools offer distance learning such as video conferences as a way for students to attend class at their home. Having the option to attend class at home is very beneficial. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they will get more sleep, have more comfort and will be safer.

Firstly, students will be able to sleep longer by being able to attend classes by video conferences. Many students take the bus and have to wake up early for school because they have to shower, eat breakfast, and get dressed for school. By giving the option for video conferences students wouldn't be stressed to complete their morning routine in time. Also, studies have shown that students who are well rested, with the recommended eight hours of sleep tend to receive higher grades. As one can see, students will be less stressed and will receive higher grades just be receiving more sleep.

Secondly, students are more comfortable in their own home than at school. With having video conferences as an option students will be able focus more and have less distractions. At school there is plenty of distractions such as fellow students and many background noises. These distractions can lead to lower grades since students can't concentrate and do their best work. When a student is at home they can go to the bathroom, get food, and get drinks whenever necessary which is more efficient than having to wait for lunch and follow different classroom rules.

Also, studies have proven that students tend to learn more when they are in a place where they are comfortable and can relax. By the reasons stated above people can see that being comfortable can be more beneficial.

Thirdly, being able to have video conference classes at home, students will be safer. Many students drive to and from school everyday. By having classes at home students wouldn't have to drive as much causing the vehicular accident rate to decline. Also students wouldn't have as many bad influences surrounding them. For example, if Generic_Name was at school for class he would be surrounded by other students that do alcohol and drugs. By not being around them Generic_Name can prevent being per pressured to use those illegal substances. By the evidenced stated above students will be safer by having the option for video conference classes.

In conclusion, having video conference classes is very beneficial. Many people argue that not everyone has technology at their homes but schools don't require students to use the online conferences, they can still come to school for their education. By being able to get more sleep, have more comfort, and be safer students are more benefited by having the option for video conferences. If schools didn't offer online conferences their would be more accidents and less educated people. If that were to happen the US economy would decline and the US would slowly crumble. Do you want that to happen? Hopefully not.
