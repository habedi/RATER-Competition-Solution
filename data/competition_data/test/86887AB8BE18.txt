Students would benefit from this a lot because if you always gonna be late to class, Which shouldn't happen then it would be best if you took school at your house. That means you stay in your house you can eat what you have at your home, and it makes you feel good and comfortable.

All that would then make the person taking school in his/her house feel ready to learn new things.

The reason I choose this is because in school its really boring it's just gets you tired sitting in a chair for hours listening to someone talk about something.

And I think doing school work at home would be best because you can get up and easily walk to the bathroom, or get some food from the kitchen.

Now if you forget your things for school like pens,books,paper, it will now be easy to get because you are taking your classes online at home. In conclusion I think it's very beneficial to be able to attend class at home than at school.Â
