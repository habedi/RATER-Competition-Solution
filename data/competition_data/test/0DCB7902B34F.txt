This new technology to read emotional expressions is stupid. I am against this machine for there is no value to, possibly inacurate, and what is there to learn from.?

The first reason why I am against it is that I don't see any value in it. Why would people want to know what there emotional expression is when they are the ones who are doing the expression. The other person might want to know but at the same time maybe they're okay with what they are seeing from the other person than finding out what is behind it that expression. To me that's like invading my personal emotions, and then when they find out it means something else they might be mad or asking questions why.

The next reason is, that there might be a possibility that the machine is incorrect. For example, when the person is acting like he/she is mad but messing around, but the machine might take it serious and the person who doesn't know if he/she is actually mad will think that is and start asking questions why are they mad at them and then it create an argument between them. There also could be a malfunction in the system and when the person is actually happy the machine might take it as a sad and fearful expression and that will raise some questions.

The last reason why I am against it is what is there to learn from the machine? The only thing I see it as a helping thing is when it comes to court and therapy setions. The only thing I can see it as is a machine that causes violence and arguments. There is absolutely nothing else you can learn from it and to me its useless.

These are the reasons why I'm against this emotional expression machine. They are: there is no value to it, possibility of inarcuracy, and nothing to learn from it.
