Living in a community without the use of cars can be extremely beneficial. It might seem odd to say such an idea because we have lived in towns with alot of car usage all of our lives. Heidrun Walter said, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Not having a car can be very stressless. This is because you do not have to worry about wrecking your car, keeping up with the insurance payments, talking care of it (such as oil changes) and eventually, having to buy a new one which can be very expensive.

Another reason why not having a car is beneficial is that it can help the enviornment. Right now, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. This number keeps on climbing because more and more people are buying cars which just puts more gas into the enviornment.

An even greater benefit of living in a community without cars is that you can get more excercise. Sitting in the car everyday going to and from work for 2 hours is not being productive. However, in the existing car-free communities, all the necessary store are in walking or biking distance from the majority of the population. So, the commute to work for most people can be just like getting a daily exercise and staying in shape.

In conclusion, I firmly beleive that living in a community without cars would be a change for the better. It would help with everyones finanical situations and everyone would have better health because you would have to bike and walk everywhere. As of lately, it has seemed like less and less people have started to use cars. The number of miles drivn peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since. In April, 2013 the average number of miles driven was 9 percent below the peak in 2005.
