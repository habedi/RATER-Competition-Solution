Twenty-five years ago, NASA found what looked like a human face on the planet of Mars. Early in the discovery, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. A few days later, NASA presented the image to the public. The picture definitely attracted attention to Mars, which is what NASA wanted. Soon after, the public was let down being told it was just a natural landform and that it wasn't an alien landform after all. However, some people would beg to differ.

There is always possibilities about aliens and what they do in space, but this is not one of them. The face is nothing but a natural landform. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at the face. The text states that Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo with the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters. This proved that all this landform was was something similar to a butte or mesa which is common around the American West. Garvin states, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." Overall, these two landforms are about the same.

Along with the picture of the face, if anything else was on Mars, we would've seen them with the high quality image. The text stated, "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size." If any sign of martians was on Mars, we would've been able to see it. Objects such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks would have been able to be identified.

Although, martians could still possibly be out in our universe, this face on Mars will not prove that. Many would like to believe this is a martian mesa but it is nothing but a natural landform. Landforms like this can be found even in places on Earth. The mystery of martians still continues, but the mystery of the face on Mars has finally been a "case closed".
