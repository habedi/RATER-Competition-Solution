In a class room situation it would be so amazing to be able to see how everyone is feeling and how they feel about a certain subject. So, As a example if you used this system in a math class you could give out equations and make the students solve them. Another way this could be used is if you put it in a musical classroom and let the students play music would the music have a effect on the students emotions? I think a amazing place to put this system would be in the cafe during lunch periods just to see what the effect of food does to the students. So, In a math situation where you give students equations to solve and see what their emotions are about the equations it would be great to know how well they feel about the problems.

So, If the students where sat down for a hour and a half with a math problem and where confused the system could alert the teacher and the teacher could provide extra help. While in a musical classroom we could see what the effects of a musical piece has on students to see if musical classes are worth keeping in school systems. In lunch periods where we get to talk to all our friends and relax seeing what kind of emotions that adds to a students day could be really helpful.

I think overall adding a system like this into a classroom situation would be very helpful. As long as it was accurate it could help students out a lot more and provide better grades over all. Also, This system could be used a teachers asssistant and help the teacher know who needs help. These are some reasons I think adding a system like this into a school enviroment would be very helpful.
