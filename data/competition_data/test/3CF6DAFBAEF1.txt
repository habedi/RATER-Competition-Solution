In most parts of the United States cars are our everyday transportation. We use cars in our everyday lives to transport us everywhere, whether it is from home to work or school and other places. What alot of people don't realize is all the advantages that not driving a car everyday has. If we were to use less vehicles in the U.S it would incourage most people to excercise more and have a healthier lifestyle. It would also help our environment be less polluted. Finally it would also help improve safety by decreasing the ammount of car accidents we have every year.

By not using a car every day, people would have to find other ways of transportation like riding bicyles or just simply walking everywhere. In the U.S we have a large percentage of obese people. I think this would help a large ammount of people lose weight by being more fit in there everyday lifes. It would incourge these people to play sports and go to parks more often. Our community would be much healthier and happier.

Not only will this new idea help our community but it would also help our environment be healthier by conserving resources and the atmosphere would be less polluted. Because we use cars everyday it has caused alot of air polution which is one of the many reasons why the ozone layer has been getting damaged. This would also benefit us by having better air to breathe. Our environment will be healthier and nicer for us to enjoy.

Finally this would help reduce the ammount of car accidents we have every year in the U.S. Most deaths in the U.S are caused by car accidents. By reducing the ammount of time we drive cars it would improve our safety and the ammount of deaths each year would be reduced. This would also be a benefit to our community because it would increase the number of our population.

Our lifes would be healthier and safer by not using cars every day. this would benefit us all and our environment. People should take these advantages in consideration and think about this next time they drive a car.
