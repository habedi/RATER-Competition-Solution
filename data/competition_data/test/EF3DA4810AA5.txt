To The Principal:

I think all students should be require to do community service because they would help the community. Not all students should be require, they should only let the students who don't do work or are bad in class to do community service. For example, if a boy or girl are fighting their punishment should be to do community service, like picking up trash from their school or around the school. Even if the student is bad in class like acting foolish or jumping around screaming at the teacher they should give that student community service, so he or she could learn what not to do. So they disserve what they get. I think community service would help the students more so they could teach him or her a lesson. Also students should learn how to help the community, by picking up trash around them even if they didn't drop it they should help the community. So i think students should be require to do community service.
