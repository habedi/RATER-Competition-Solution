I am in the Seagoing Cowboys program and you should be too.

You take care of cattle that are shipped over seas. Some people are proud of me some people are not. The text states, "UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas."

We take not only cattle but supplies like food supplies. We took these to help. We help countries that were in ruins. The text states, "It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins."

The text also states, "To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more."

I turned 18 befor we got to greece.

Which means I can join the military.

They let me keep doing what I was doing for survice.

The text states, "Luke turned 18 which means he can be drafted for military survice."

The text also states, "When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my survice.
