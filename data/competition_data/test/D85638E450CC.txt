TEACHER_NAME,

I would like it if you would reconsider the cell phone policy. If students can have time during breaks and other free times such as lunch, the cell phone problem would be less of an inconvenience to you as well as teachers. It would give students an opportunity to text freely and not worry about getting in trouble as well as wasting time and or disrupting class. Texting during class will be the least of your worries. Teachers could even check to see if students' cell phones are turned off before they enter into any classroom. This would be a great opportunity also because most of the time students are texting their friends that go to the same school, making it to were it distracts not only the student sending the message but also the student receiving the message. This is another thing that you won't have to worry about if you reconsider the cell phone policy. However, if the cell phone was to goes off in class, the phone shall be taken up and cannot be brought back to school. If the student is caught with the phone on school property, the phone will be taken away and will not be given back until the end of the year under any circumstances. It will be very important to be sure to be strict when enforcing this policy, but it is well worth considering for students, teachers, and most importantly, you. Please consider the policy.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
