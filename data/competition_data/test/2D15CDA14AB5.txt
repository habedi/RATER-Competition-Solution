Dear Principal,

Personally i think everyone should be required to perform at least some community service. It may not be the most fun thing to do, but everyone should help out their community. Think of the human body, if not all of the parts of the body did their job the human would not function correctly. It may even fall apart. Imagine if the lungs or heart didn't work. What would happen to the system then? Everyone needs to help out and do something good for their community.

If it weren't for some people's hard work, there would not be a lot of fun things to do in some places. Here in Somerset we have a skating rink, a mall, a playground and many other things to do for fun. I think since we use those places and live in this community we should repay them by cleaning up a park, painting a fence, or volunteering for your local animal shelter. Sometimes its just good character to help someone out, not asking for anything in return. I think that if you as a principal wants to teach kids how to be respectful and helpful, then community service is a great way to do it. Even if its just making posters for the school or planting flowers out back, it not only makes the people that do it feel good about themselves seeing their work being displayed, but it also makes the school look better.

I think that some people look at community service in a negative way because it can be used as punishment. People shouldn't be forced into helping out their community. They should view it as a great honor and something fun to do with friends.

Something else you might want to consider when doing community service is to relate it to something you enjoy. For example over the summer I volunteered at the animal shelter. I absolutely love animals so

I had a great time feeding, walking and playing with the cats and dogs that lived there. I met my special friends there too. I was cleaning a tawny colored cat's cage one day and I noticed he had six toes rather than five. I was intrigued by this and was eager to see him again. The next day when I was supposed to feed him I ended up giving him the name "Six-Toed Joe". Throughout the summer me and that adorable six-toed cat bonded. I even ended up adopting him and bringing him home at the end of the summer.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is this: Community Service in my eyes is definitely a yes because everyone needs to help out and it may even teach you a valuable lesson. Plus, its also a self-confidence booster when you see the good things that you've done around your community.

Sincerely,
