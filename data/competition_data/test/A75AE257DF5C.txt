Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that we should be able to have our cell phones during school being able to use them during lunch periods and free times as long as it is turned off during class. I think that because if a students parent is sick or in the hospital they should be able to use the cell phone to call. I also think that we should be able to use cell phones because if teachers get a phone call they can answer it i think that we should be able to. I think that you should only be able to answer you cell phone if it is like an emergency or if it is a call from your parents but if it is like a phone call from a family remember but i think that if we are allowed to use them then if something was to happen we could contact somebody. And if we are sick instead of going to the nurse you can just call your mom. And then again if you say no i understand because you will be thinking like what if i let then and then because i said that they will think that it is ok for them to use their phone whenever they want to and that they will just pull out there phone and just text i think that we should for if there is an emergency with a family member. But if you to take this into considerate then i think that during class that the teacher should take every students phones and put them in a box and put them in the closet and lock them up.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
