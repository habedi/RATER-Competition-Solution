The author supports his idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers by explaining how its the closest planet to us. Venus used to have oceans just like earth. Tare some details the author give us in the passage about enus being an worthy but dangerous planet to explore.

In paragragraph 2 he explains how its the closest planet to earth in terms to density and size. Its also closest in distance to us at certain times. Its dangerous because they sent several space craft and it only lasted a few Hours after it landed. Thats probably the reason why not a single spaceship has landed in more than three decades ago.

It would be hard to land there and stay ther because of the heat and the carbon dioxide. the atmosphere is almost 97 pecent carbon dioxide which would make it impossible to breathe in. The average temperature is over eight hundred degrees fahrenheit. the pressure is also ninety times greater than what we experience.

The scientitist wouldnt be able to take rock or gases off the planet so they would have to get close and take huge risk. NASA s working on studies for venus like they simplifie electronice and made silicone carbide that has been tested in chamber simulatin wich could last up to threee weeks. He thinks its because of human curiosity and will likelyy lead to many equally intimidating endeavors.

These are some of the examples of the author using details in the text showing why he beleives ecploring Venus is worthey other than all the danger.
