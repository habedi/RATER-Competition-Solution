I am for the development of these cars because they can change how so many things can be done today in society. The cars could be able to take packages or important items or documents for miles. The driverless cars can be escorts or help people that don't know how to drive get around much faster than they usually do.

The cars can help get an accurate position in parallel parking so people don't get harmed or damage other vehicles in the process. There can still be some downside to the whole process though,the cars could have a misfunction and go out in the middle of traffic or wreck into another car or pedestrian on the sidewalk. The could stop functioning while delivering something and the receiver will never get what they're supposed to.

Many people would agree and disagree on this concept,but most of them wouldn't experience it for themsleves so they wouldn't know what its capable of. People could stll be in the vehicle while they aren't controlling it,so while that happens,they can be texting,eating,talking,or possibly sleeping. The idea of driverless cars could be horrifying or magnificent if the way you think of it makes it. People will have their own opinions but once they experience it their opinions could change at a moments notice.
