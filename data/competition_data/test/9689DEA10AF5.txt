I disagree with forcing a student to do a sport, club, or any other kind of activity at school. I disagree because the student may not really want to play a sport or do any other kind of activity. Also, the student may be a shy person, or they may have social anxiety issues. Finally, what if he/she has other things they do at home? For example, they could be playing a sport that is not connected to the school, or they have their own job perhaps. I would not force a student to do any activity at school.

We should not force students at school to do activities of any kind. If you wanted a student to try a sport or a club, you should try to persuade them to try it out. For example, I'm trying to persuade you that the principal should not force students to do any activity, so the principal should try to persuade the student to try something new. Many students have lots of stress on them, such as homework, things they do at home, and maybe even bullies. Therefore, we should not add more stress to students. It's a bad idea to make students do any sport, club, or activity at school.
