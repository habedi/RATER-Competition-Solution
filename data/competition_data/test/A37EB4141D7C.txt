Why should students be forced to be in school for more hours? Student are already in school for more then half the day. If these children waste their child hood almost all day at school, They will become more hyper and misbehaved. At one point of the day all of their energy will over flow and just explode. When their energy bursts they are going to be yelled at.

After enough of this students won't be excited to go to school and learn. This could also mess up thir sleeping schedule.Â Students are going to be in school for longer, their going to be wanting to be awake at home for longer. This will cause tardy's to school the next day. Parents will be furious and get angry at the schools for forcing them to stay at school for even longer then they already have to. Parents are going to start calling school free daycare, and teachers arent going to like that.

Teachers will also not like this because they will get less free time. Many teachers have kids and husbands. This would limit their time with their family. Teachers have a life out side of school and the principal has to understand that. These teachers have longer days then the students. They have to make the lessons, quizzes, and tests outside of school. Teachers dont get paid enough to spend their whole days working. If this happens the young teachers will age faster, and their attitudes are going to get worse because of their lack of sleep. In reality this isn't going to benefit anyone.

The new rule is a waste of time to students and teachers. All kids want is freedom, and putting them in school for extra hours will make school look more like a prison to them. Doing this will not prepare them for the real world. Although this may make students more school smart, they will need to learn how to be street smart to survive the future.
