Dear Principal,

Students should be allowed to use phones during lunch period and other free time. Not allowing students to bring phones to school at all would anger students and cause them to use their phones anyway at any time they think they can get away with it. It would also create an unnecessary disciplinary task for the staff. Banning phones altogether would also create a safety hazard in an emergency, as students would not be able to all communicate outside of school.

In debating on whether to ban phones altogether, we can think back to the times of prohibition. Banning phones would have a similar effect. Students would simply use their phones in secret to rebel against the rule. Students would be angered that they could not bring their phones to school, creating a distraction in class that would not exist if phones were allowed during free time.

Also thinking back to prohibition times, we can recall the pains that police forces had to go through to stem the tide of bootleggers. Simply banning phones would create an unnecessary task for the staff of the school. It would be a waste of the staff's time to enforce this rule.

Banning phones would also create a safety risk during an emergency. If there were a fire or lockdown, very few or no students would be able to communicate with their family or friends. School phones are simply not adequate for the amount of kids that need to call home during an emergency, especially during a fire.

So if your still planning on banning phones, don't! Though many may say that they will distract kids, it be worse with a ban. Allowing them during free times would eliminate effects such as angry kids using them in secret and the waste of teachers time it would be. All inall, it is better not to risk it, especially in an en=merge
