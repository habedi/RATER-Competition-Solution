Dear principle:

i agree with your suggestion of requiring at least a B average because if you do then the students will have an extra incentive to bring there grade up from a C average to at least a B or who knows even an A, also i think that you should do this because if you do then the students will bring there grades up therefore making our school seem better in academics.

firstly, our students would be studying like crazy if they knew that they had to keep there average above a

B in order to stay on there sports team, because students need to do there sports because they need physical activity and competition out side of p. e , this is there incentive for them to study more frequently student will study more frequently which will bring there grades up from classwork and tests and they will keep it up there because thy know that if it drops then they will get kicked off the basketball/baseball/vollyball or whatever they choose to participate in. according to sports illustrated 90% of schools who require a B average to stay in sports have shown an increase in there schools average. in addition to that they would be doing so well on tests that the school average would go up therefore making the schools academics and the school overall look better then the other schools and our past history of academic grades i don't know about you but this sounds like a pretty good idea to me to conclude my letter i shall say this i believe that the raising of the average for sports inside of our school would be a great idea because it not only benefits our school but it also benefits our student body in total
