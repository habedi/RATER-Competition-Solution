Dear principle,

This is an unreasonable policy. Students should have rights to play sports or participate in other activities in the school. If most of the students have a grade C average and are not able to play sports, why would the school even pay for the sports? it doesn't make sense.

The passing grade is about a C. Students should be able to play and participate in school sports and activities. If a student is passing class or not, no one can stop them from playing sports. I do know that most students are passing. At school, students can play sports as long as they have a C average or higher. It should stay that way throughout all junior high and high schools.

If the rules push the kids to stress over getting a B average then they wont be focused on anything else but that. Pushing the kids makes us stress even more , making us tired and cranky. I know for a fact if you, my principle, changed the grade average for sports up to a B, the students would complain, then complain to their parents. Their parents would end up complaining to the you and it would be a disaster. Grade averages shouldn't have anything to do with sports. If the students are passing they should be able to play. I do understand however, that if a student isn't passing school, they still wont focus on their grades. If a student isn't passing school and they are participating in school, that wont change their opinion on school and they will continue to fail.

Having a B average or higher just to play sports is not cool. The grade average should be passing. Since a majority of the students in the school have a C average, they probably wouldn't have enough people to make a full team for any of the sports and then the teams wouldn't be able to compete against other schools or teams so it would be boring and lame. The only downfall i can think of for this topic is that if an ample of students are focusing on sports and only sports, they wont think about how it could be affecting their grades in school. If the student gets a D or an F, they should only be suspended from the sport until they raise their grade. That way the student wont refuse to get their grade up. Choosing between raising your grade and focusing on school is a hard multi task, but everyone is capable of doing that. Don't raise the student grade average to participate in sports to a higher grade. It just means more stress on the kids, but it does mean that more students will pass. Remember that, a student passing and playing sports is a happy student.

Take me for example, if i didn't have a passing grade i couldn't participate in any of my favorite sports in school like track or soccer. I would be angry if i had to get kicked off the teams for failing school. Most students would end up complaining about the school policy if you changed it. I don't recommend changing the policy for your sake and for the sake of the students. Keep the grade average at a C. Students do fine in school already, don't make it worse and more stressful. In a study shown, more kids with less sleep and more stress don't pass in school throughout junior high and high school. That's a way to think of it.

Through passed experience, having to keep up a passing grade and playing sports and dealing with stuff at home isn't exactly 100% easy, but it is very possible. All you have to do is not give up and you can succeed. Take my word for it.
