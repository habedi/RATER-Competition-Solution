Do you ever wonder what life today would be like if we didnt have cars? Not having a car today wouldn't be such a bad thing. Maybe the economy would get better because we would have to pay for fuel. The advantages of limiting your car usage is the it could lower the rate of global warming and people around the worls wouldn't have to pay for parking or tolls to get somewhere.

The first advantage to limiting your car usage is to lower the rate of global warming. Cars today are the main source of global warming. Source two says "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after five-days of smog...", This is what happens when ther is too much smog in the city and people can't drive around because they can't see where they are going. In Europe, the United States, and other places are startinga movement called "smart planning" where they seperate suburban life from auto use. Source one states "And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions...". That right there proves that the use of cars and fuel are a big part of global warming and that we should limit car usage.

The second advantage to limiting car usage is that we wouldn't have to pay for parking anymore and we wouldn't have to pay for tolls. Citizens probably pay millions of dollars everyday for parking and tolls. Source one says "Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the adge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home." Citizens shouldn't have to pay that much for a parking space and thats just in Vauban, Germany. What if every country statered doing that? Then the economy would really be bad.

In the end, there aren't very many advantages to limiting car usage but the adventage of lowering the rate of global warming and not paying parking or tolls is a good start and maybe if we start with something small like that we can conqure something bigger later on and not use car at all.
