Mrs. Generic_Name just announced that all students must participate in one or more extracurricular activities. Everyone one doesn't know what they are are going to do now and disagrees with her. Me, myself agree's with Mrs. Generic_Name, however, most students do nothing after they get home for school. So, being in an extracurricular activity can be fun, you can do clubs, sports, and volunteering.

First, in clubs you can do a lot of interesting things. My brother is in FFA, and last spring break he went to Texas with his FFA club. They went to Forth Worth, Alabama, and Nashville. Which those place are very cool to go and visit. Then also in FFA you can do a CDE, which is where you can study about different things. I do small animal care therefore, you learn about different animals, diseases, and how to take care of an animal. Also if you're in a club you can make friends out of you state. I went to national convention this fall and meet a kid for Georgia and we still talk to this day.

Secondly, you can be in a sport. "Sports make you blood flow" as my mom would always tell me. That's why she would always like for me and my brother to play a sport. You're getting exercise when you are playing and getting exercise is good for your body. If you are doing a sport that you really enjoy, you could be an professional player. Being an professional means you're really good and enjoy doing what you do. By playing sports year after year you will make some friend that you probably didn't think you would be friend with. I play volleyball for a travel team and for JV and I've made some pretty close friends because I played year after year.

Lastly, you can volunteer. You can volunteer different places like the SPCA and fire fighter. Volunteering in your community by picking up trash. I volunteer at a SPCA ,I help the animals and take them for a walk. I feel like everyone should at least volunteer somewhere in there community because people are littering and not putting it in the trash can like they are suppose to. I've have always thought this in my head, " We give to the community, the community will get back to the citizens."

There are so much more busy people then there were 20 years ago.

Mrs. Generic_Name wants every student to participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Yet, all of the student are disagreeing with her. But I think everyone should because, they won't do anything when they get home for school. Extracurricular activities are good for you. You can play a sport, volunteer, and be in a club. All three of them are fun to be in and do.
