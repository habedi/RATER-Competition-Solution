It's a hot summer day, ninety degree's outside to be exact, and you're swimming at the pool with your friends, enjoying your summer. When, all of a sudden, you realize you haven't started or even looked at your summer project. Luckily, you don't have to stress because your teacher already designed your summer project for you. Although some critics may believe that summer projects should be student-designed, I believe the contrary. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because student's don't have to stress about designing their projects, each student would have a unique project, and project ideas are already approved by the teacher.

First off, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it will alleviate students stress during their student holiday. Students are already stressed out during the school year and don't need to be stressed on their break from school. Designing a project can be very complex and coming up with an idea for a project is even harder. During my sophomore year of high school, my science fair group was required to design a project for the science fair. My group consisted of three girls and we couldn't think of any ideas on how to design our project. As the deadline for our project design approached, the more stressed we became. Eventually, we succeeded but I wouldn't dare to imagine designing the project over the summer. Teacher-designed summer projects are the superior option because it save students from stressing and worrying over their break.

Secondly, summer projects should be teacher-designed because no two students would have the same project. Summer projects should be one of a kind so students can learn while completing the project themselves. With adequate internet access today, students could easily go online and search up easy student-designed summer projects. By doing so, students could design the same project and not learn anything. In the fifth grade, my teacher instructed my class to design our own projects. My partner and I chose to design a solar system because we were learning about the solar system in class. When it came time to present our projects, we noticed that a few other students did the same project. Thus, summer projects should be teacher-designed because each student would have their own unique project.

Lastly, summer projects should be teacher-designed because project ideas would already be teacher approved. Summer projects should be age appropriate for the students because the main idea behind summer projects is for students to learn from them. If students designed their own summer projects, they could easily choose a simple idea to be free from the last burden of school so they can enjoy their summer. During my sophomore year of high school, my science teacher made sure that every topic was teacher approved to ensure that our science fair designs fit the criteria of a high school sophomore. By doing so, she guaranteed that everyone will learn from their project. Furthermore, summer projects should be teacher-designed because project ideas would be approved by the teacher, thus, ensuring that the project designs are not too easy and are equally challenging.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by the teacher because it would alleviate student stress, ensure that each student has their own specific project, and makes sure that each topic is appropriate. Summer projects should be fun and encourage students to learn over their break. They should not be a burden on every students shoulders and cause them to worry over their break from school. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to encourage students to continue their education even when they are not in school.
