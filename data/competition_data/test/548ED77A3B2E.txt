I don't think that the principal should not decide if higher more educated students should be the only ones to participate in sports or not. Because some kids do not do so well in school but they do well in sports. I think it wouldn't be fair to some of the kids that would like to play a sport they cannot, just because of their grade. Another reason i think that average kids that get like C' s should be able to participate in school sports because its not like their failing or anything, But i mean they are about average in school so they should get to play sports. If they want to be in like a play or something then they should allow kids that get average grades to participate. Because if they don't they can put a lot or little stress on their students because they cannot work or do anything to get their grade any higher. As you can see i strongly disagree with this principal.
