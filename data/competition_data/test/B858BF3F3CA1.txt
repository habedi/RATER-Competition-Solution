Hello my name is Luke Bomberger and I am apart of the Seagoing Cowboys. I joined the orginazation for two reasons. Number one, because it interesting to see a bunch of different sights. Number two is that I get to help people who were affected by war. I was eighteen when I joined the orginization, so that meant I could be drafted for war at any time. This made me feel me feel worried, but then I went to Greece and I every thing was okay. Now enough about me I am here to encourage you to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

You should join the program. It feels great to know that you are making a difference in somebody's life. Plus, like I said there are a lot of cool sights to see. I have been to nine different places. I saw something amazing in each place out of the nine. You can try all new different things. Like new food, new music, new sports, new almost everything. Now I know what you are thinking that is crazy how am I supposted to adjust to something so quickly that is impossible, but trust me it is not as hard as is sounds. If your still not hooked (which I don't know why you wouldn't be) it can be a lot of fun. I know again it doesn't sound like it but when we arn't helping out we play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, we read, and whittling. So I hope you decide to join.
