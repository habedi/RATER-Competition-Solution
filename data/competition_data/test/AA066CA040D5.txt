To TEACHER_NAME

I think that policy 1 is a good policy. I agree that we should be able to bring our phones to school.

There are many reasons why i think we should be able to bring our phones to school.

What if there was an emergency and no-one was around you would need a phone.

In your classes and you had nothing to do you could be texting on your phone because that is what the kids are in to these days.

Some kids have there mom come and pick them up from school and after tutoring classes they would need a phone to call home and tell a parent.

Cell phones are really good acceries for kid and adults.

They give you something to do at all times.

School is not a place for a cell phone but we should be able to bring our phones. If everybody cut there phones off during classes and would not play on them during class some teachers would get a lot more done.

There would be one less thing to worrier about while your at school.

From what you have noticed is that i like cell phones, and i think we should be able to use our phones at school.

In case of an emergency or just boredom.

We should be able to text on our phones at school. Like i said before it would be one less thing we would have to worried about at school is getting our phone taken away.
