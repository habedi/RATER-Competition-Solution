The reason why people want to learnn more about venus is because is that its the closet planet compaired to earth in are solar system. Even with its dangerous conditions it shares many simularites to earth. It has things like valleys, mountains, and craters.

The reason however why we've never been able to get a closer look at it is be cause of is dangorus conditions. Things like valcanic europtions, earthquakes, and the contsant lighting storm make it difficult to gett anthing to land on the the ground. However the reason why scientist still wish sto study this planet is that it still would be somewhat possible to support human life.

There was even possibley one point when venus was the most earth like planet in our solar system. It may have even at one point when it could have been possible to support life and it might even had supported life at one point. This is probably why scientist strive to land something on it.

These are the reasons why the authors claims are very much a possibilty. Maby some day venus well be more like a countroy and become a tourist destinaition or just become a place for people to live. but we mont know unless we keep on trying.
