In 1945 over 44 countries were left in ruins,from World War II in Europe,and they needed to recover. Those 44 countries joined together and formed the UNRRA(the United Nations Relif and Rehabilitaion Administration).The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of shipping animals to the broken down countries. While delivering animals you also get free time to sightsee. For example you can take a gondala ride while in Venice,Italy or be amazed by the Panama Canal on your way to China. Although,the sights are marvelous it is hardwork to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Animals have to be fed 2 to 3 times a day,food has to be pulled up from lower holds of the ship,stalls have to be cleaned and much more.

Making you more aware of other countries and their needs. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a huge opproutunity to be in and you should definintly join.
