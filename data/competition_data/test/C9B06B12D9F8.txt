Did you know the principle decided that all students must take an extracurricular activity?

But the extracurricular activities can be fun. It has sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council,and many more to choose from.

But I strongly disagree with this statement because,People have other things outside of school. Some students outside of school might be busy because they have things to do so they can't do extracurricular stuff,students may not have the time to take extracurricular activities. Some students might not have the time to attend extracurricular classes, they might have other things to take care of. Students might not enjoy the things they do. Some students might not even want to go if theres nothing that interests them, so they would not take part of the activities.

At the end

I disagree with the concept of making students take extracurricularÂ activities. Its terrible idea to the students and could take off time for the teachers as well, and how much time spent to the curriccluar activities. So forcefully making students take part of a extracurricular activity is bad and could be worse.
