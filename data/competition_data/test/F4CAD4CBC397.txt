So when you think of going somewhere mysterious, dangerous, or exiciting, you may think for Oceans. Probably not. Space. Maybe. The Planet Venus. Defintinly. Many people can say they know that Venus is a planet, but not really anything else because we just don't know a lot about it. So Venus is a planet worth discovering because we can learn if the planet use to be Earth a long time ago, find more about it and help us understand the planet more, and despite the dangers how it can benefit us by knowing more about it.

To start off, understanding a planet is the most benefical way we can do because if we understand it, then we will learn more about it. In the arctilce it says. " More importanly, reachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persconal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challanges. Many reseachers are working are working on innovations that world allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowedge of Venus". This quote from the article supports that even through we don't know much about it, we can still do it if we can get closer to Venus surface to study more and understand why is it the way it is. Also, by knowing more about will help us understand why it the way it is because we will have more information and facts behind understanding it.

Next thing I am going to talk about the the dangers behind Venus and and benefit why knowing about it will make that more easier becasue by doing this we came make it safer for humans and machines to be able to stay there for longer periods of time. In the articleis says " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent crbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sufuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures avergaes over 880 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on own planet". This is showing that the Venus atmosphere is dangerous, but we would not known that if we didn't take a chance to learn more about the planet. Futhermore, if we did not know about this we could gone to Venus and could have died because we did not know what the atmosphere was like.

Futhermore, on the topic of Venus at it the closest related planet to Earth because to has similar geography of Earth. I the article is says " Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to thise of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and inculdes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters". This quote is saying that Venus is almost identical to Earth in some many ways like the geography structure to animal life on Earth. This is earthskaing because if Venus is almost indentical to Earth, then maybe millions of years ago that could been what happen to the Earth before ours and could be what this earth could look like millions of years from know.

On the otherhand they say Venus can be to dangerous because of how bad the atmosphere is for humans and machines. In the article is says " These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accomtomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquely many metals". They say this in the article but this is a little false because in the article it says " Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans". By saying this in the article this could meaning the quoute could be truth because id the atmosphere is so dangerous when why say its survivable for humans.

All and all, Venus is a planet worth discovering because we can learn if the planet use to be Earth a long time ago, find more about it and help us understand the planet more, and despite the dangers how it can benefit us by knowing more about it. Find more information about can help for farer investigattion on ethe planet and understanding a planet is the most benefical way we can do because if we understand it, then we will learn more about it. Despite the dangers to behind Venus and and benefit why knowing about it will make that more easier because by doing this we came make it safer for humans and machines so it can be able to stay there for longer periods of time. Aslo, learning about that Venus is the closest related planet to Earth because to has similar geography of Earth can help in faer discovers. Even though they say Venus can be to dangerous because of how bad the atmosphere is for humans and machines, then they say that humans can survived on Venus. So in the end Venus a dangerous planet to be discover, but if we do not, then who will?
