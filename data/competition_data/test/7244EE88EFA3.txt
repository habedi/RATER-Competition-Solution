To the principal,

I think this is a good idea to help keep students working hard and trying their best, but i also have negative things to say.

I am going to start off by naming the negative reasons about this new policy. First of all, some children are actually trying and, maybe, can't get a higher grade than a C. If you punish children like that, what are they going to think of themselves? Their attitude could change from happy to maybe a little more sad or angry. They could push themselves so hard to try to get the subject, and a bad outcome could come out of it.

Now I am going to name the positives off. First of all, a lot of children, now days, think it is 'cool' to not do good in school, so this would strive them to make a greater effort so they could participate in the sports they play. I know for a fact, a lot of kids are not trying to their greatest efforts. Also this new policy would make our school look better because then most of the students here will have As, Bs, or maybe Cs. Maybe then, more students would come here because the parents would see what a great job all of the other students are doing and their son or daughter would also do a better job with their grades.

I personally think you should keep this new policy , but instead of a B average grade, make it a C average for the grade. If you put it to a C, then children would have to still work hard and make an effort, but they can still have one C her and there if they are having trouble with a lesson or subject. I think this is a great plan for our school, it would have teachers' attitudes become a little more positive thinking that their students are going to try harder now and will get better grades.

Thank you for hearing about my thoughts and please keep this in your mind when you make this new policy official for our school.
