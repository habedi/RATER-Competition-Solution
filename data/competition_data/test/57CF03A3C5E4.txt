Dear Principle,

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME i'm a student from SCHOOL_NAME. I think we shouldn't be required to perform community service because it wastes to much time. I am against this because of multiple reasons: 1 .Why do we have to clean up someone else trash? 2. Its a complete waste of time . and 3. We have better things to do other the cleaning up trash . In this passage I will state every reason.

Why do we have to clean up someone else trash?

Why? Its there trash they should we be the ones to clean it not us.

Its a complete waste of time.

Well it is a complete waste of time to clean up after someone else because they're to lazy.

We have better things to do.

We probably do have something better to do other than community service such as sports, family time, etc.

In my honest opinion I think community is an option not a requirement for students and I think its just a waste of time to clean up after other people that just litters on the street, freeway, and parks. So yeah I hope you read this through and think about your answer about students being required to do community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
