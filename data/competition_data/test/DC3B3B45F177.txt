Do you think summer projects should be required? Do you think summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed ? Some schools are now requiring students to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning during their summer break. Many are arguing whether the projects should be created by teachers or students. Students are convinced they have what takes to create their own project while others are concerned and would rather teachers do it. Some teachers feel the same way they don't think it's fair to put their students education on the line just because they don't have the resources they need in order to be successful. In my opinion teachers should be creating the projects because they have more knowledge/experience,they'll make sure students have the resources they need,and it's easier on them as well as the students. These are some of my reasons as to why I think teachers should design summer projects.

Having a teacher create a project instead of a student is helpful because they have knowledge as well as experience. They know what students struggle with as well as ways to help them. This can be very helpful to students because they're forced to work on their weaknesses and improve them. If they're confused about something on the project they could ask their teacher for help as well as their classmates. Because teachers have experience they know how to prepare their students for the upcoming year which makes it easier on students. If you don't prepare for the next step it can be really difficult to understand later on. It has been said students who don't read or do anything school related over the summer have a hard time understanding when school comes around. I once did this to myself I didn't complete my English summer reading project I thought I was going to be fine but I was wrong school started and I was lost and confused it took me a week to get on track with everyone else. A well constructed project really prepares you and nobody can construct a better one than your teacher.

Another reason as to why teachers should design the project is they know what resources students need in order to succeed.Â They know what students struggle in so they know activities to help them improve. Because they have resources they can give it makes students lives easier as appose to if a student has to find these resources on their own. Even if students do come up with a project it won't be as good as their teachers therefore it's not helping them out . It would just stress students out and not help them out whatsoever. Students would be more focused on just getting something done than actually looking for resources that could help them. An example of this would be a presentation for school if the teacher told students to do a project on a book without saying anything else students would be confused because they wouldn't have the resources necessary to do this presentation. Resources always help students but it's hard if you're a student trying to look for them on your own. Teachers know of the best resources to help their students succeed.

My last reason as to why I think teachers should create summer projects over students is it make it easier on both sides.

Students will know exactly what they're looking for as well as be tested on their weaknesses. It's easier on teachers because when grading the projects they'll know what their expectations are. While yes having a teacher design a project might be more work for the student it helps them prepare for the future. It also makes it easier on the teacher in the way that they know what they asked for instead of trying to figure out what it was suppose to be. It makes their grading easier and it also shows them what needs improvement and what you're good at. It won't stress students out more than what they are already going to be. It also makes it fair to everyone because they are all going to complete the same project . Nobody is doing more or less than someone else. The work given to the students is equal and fair for all of them to do. This is another reason to why teachers should be the ones creating the projects instead of students.

While students are given many opportunities to show their creativity I still think designing a project shouldn't be one of them. The purpose of a project is to learn and improve important things that could potentially help you in the future not something where you're trying to figure out what might or might not be important. A project should be designed by teachers because they know what's best for their students,they know how to help their students and overall it's easier for everyone. In my opinion teachers should be designing projects for their students. I'ts always been teachers that create the projects therefore it should stay that way.
