Many people and other scientists believe that the Face was created by aliens. But, I definitely disagree. First, the Face may be shaped like an actual human being's face, but it's not an actual human being face. Clearly, there's sufficient evidence to prove the Face was not created by aliens. For example, there aren't any alien monuments, and there aren't any aliens! Pictures were taken ten times, to make sure that we got clear vision of the face. Even when picture of the Face appeared on the JPL web site, some people and other scientists, thought the Face looked like a natural landform. That's because a a shadow figure kind of looks like a human face, that doesn't mean it's an actual human. Also, never have I ever seen an alien. Contrary to popular opinion, aliens don't even exist. That's almost saying the aliens are going to take over the world.

Then, I have never heard of aliens creating the Face, knowing aliens creating anything else.

The face is a natural landform because it's just a shadow. Before, when Nasa's viking ship took pictures of the shadow, their camera could have had a bad angle and probably tried to make the shadow look like a real human face.

Next, never have I have heard of a viking ship capturing pictures of any aliens. Or, have I never of anyone capturing pictures of any aliens creating the Face.

In conclusion, I still think that the Face is a human landform because, once again, there aren't any aliens. Also, there aren't any alien monuments. I think everybody is just exageratting about the whole thing. Also, people could just be freaked out about what they had heard. Some could agree with me, or some couldn't. But this is what I believe in, and I'm sticking to it.
