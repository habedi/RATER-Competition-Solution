Do you really think the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens? The "Face" is nothing but an ordinary landform of Mars. Pictures, common sense, and science have proved that.

First, there are pictures that show what the "Face" really is. The "Face" is nothing but a common mesa(2). The mesa just looks like a face because of a coincidence.

Second, any person would know that NASA would rather have money than another secret. The discovery of alien life on Mars would be very rewarding in cash, and the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars(5). They want there to be an ancient civilization because it would mean tons of money for them.

Finally, science proves that theory to be completely wrong. There have been absolutely no signs of any life whatsoever on Mars(7). If there's no life to build it, how can it be built by life?

As I said, the "Face of Mars" is nothing but a common mesa. All of these reasons have proved that. Now, if you excuse me, I have to get back to my research.
