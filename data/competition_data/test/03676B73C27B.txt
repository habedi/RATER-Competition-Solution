Since Alexander Graham Bell first patented the first practical telephone, the spreading of information has grown exponentially. The development of the telephone became something otherworldly. Today, people are able to communicate with each other at the tap of just one button. As amazing as that is, it has become an epidemic that people can't get themselves away from. More and more frequently the case of people getting into accident because of being on their cell phone while drive has been on the rise. This addiction has seemingly been the cause of many accidents that could have been avoided if people would have not been able to use their cell phones in any capacity while in control of a motor vehicle.

To begin with, cell phones and other electronics require attention from users that can't be given when operating a vehicle. Because of this, many people find themselves trying to split their attention between the phone and the road and typically end up giving more attention to the computer that they are able to hold in their hand. This lack of attention to the road causes accidents with other motorists which could have been avoided if there wasn't a phone in the way of the driver paying attention to the road. For this reason, people shouldn't even be able to use their devices in any such way while in the driver's seat of a vehicle.

Moreover, amny drivers have the mindset that their own personal driving isn't what they have to worry about--it's others. With a mindset like that, it begs the question of how that can be possible when motorists use their cellphones while driving. There is no way for anyone to be able to multitask so well that they can operate their vehicle, use their devices, and worry about others as they make it to their own destinations. Many may argue that they have the ability to do such things, but it has yet to be heard of someone multitasking at such a high caliber.

Finally, while drivers use their devices, there is simply no telling what might happen in the blink of an eye. Drivers need to be fully aware of the roads and what happening around their vehicles, so there can be not time or effort that can be put into using their electronics in any way while also driving. If someone were to lose the concentration that they have on the road, the possibility of an accident and casualties sharply increases.

In short, people should not have the ability to use their cellphones in any capacity while driving because the possibility of something tragic happen will sharply increase and the chance of someone surviving an accident because of cell phone usage will continue to drop.
