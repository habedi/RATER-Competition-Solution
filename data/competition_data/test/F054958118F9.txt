While discussing the image of the face with a co-worker, he thinks it was made by aliens,but I believe it is just a land form. I, believe that the face we see on mars is just a regular land form created as time has passed by. In paragraph two the secound sentance it says scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa. Secound, in the 12 paragraph it says, what the picture acually shows is that is Martian equivalent to a butte or a mesa, land forms that are commonly found in the American West and even reminds Garvin of

"middle Butte" in the Snake River plain on Idaho. Also scientists have figured that Earth and Mars are very much alike in size and the tempature.

Mission controlers also visited the face several more times since the first photo was taken in 1976. Still after the first photograph was taken in 1976 in 1997 they took a even better photograph then what they had aready taken in 1976. I believe as technoology gets better and we make better cameras. Ibelieve that we acn get an even better photograph in the future. As photos get better and show more details we will be able to know how tall, how wide, and just the total length of the face.
