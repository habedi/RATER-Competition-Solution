DEAR: PRINCIPAL

why we can play sport because a C. C is not failing C is steel good everybody have that is not fair for student. because think about it what happed when you were litter and you principal take something that you like and until you have a good grade you can play it. that is not good because let say you were bad and you only have D or F in you class and you mom or you dad say until you have a good grade you can play game for a month and how will that make you feel. but if you were a girl you mom take away you sail phone for a month and you can do anything about it if you grade is good you can get you sail phone back or if you boy you can get you game back. in all the class you fail how can you make you grade butter you are the only kid the suck at all the class and all of you friend get to play and you the only one that can play sport how would you feel about that so pleas don't do that to us ok pleas. and i will do my best to get butter grade so pleas don't do that to us ok principal. and thanks you for reading my latter.
