Most people think that limiting car usaging is bad, but it's actually good for the environment. In Paris, they were day's of near record pollution and has more smog then other European capitals, so they desided to ban driving to clear the air. It was successful and the smog cleared.

In Bogota, Colombia, the Colombians have a day where they are not allowed to drive. The main goal is to reduce polluton and to promote alternative transportation. In a way, it is good that the Columbians have a car free day, but when a person has to visit somebody or go to work in another city, then its gonna get difficult to go to their destination. Even though Buses and taxis can be used for transportation, citizens have to spend more money then what they usually spend when they use their own car, or if they have to use a bike to make it to there destination, it will lead them to exhaustion and will take longer to get where they need to be.

In the United States, it was said that Americans are buying fewer cars since 2005. Between the years 2001 to 2009, the percentage of young people driving decreased 23 percent. At New York, they have a bike sharing program and has increased on tunnel and bridge tolls that reflected those new priorities. Honestly, this is actually great what this country is doing. The reason for that is because with fewer drivers and the percntage of fewer drivers, it will also reduce the percentage of car crashes and reduce the amount of pollution. With the bike sharing program that they have in New York, it also help people have a better lifestyle.
