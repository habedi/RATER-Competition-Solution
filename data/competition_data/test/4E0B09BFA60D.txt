Many students in our school have a grade of C average. If the school policy is changed, and students are not allowed to participate in sports or other activities according to their grades, then most activities would have fewer participants. The difference in grades should not be the reason of being allowed to participate or not. The policy would not be fair to most students whether they're grades are a B or C average. School activities were created for fun and education. How could a student get an education in that activity if they are not allowed to participate?

Most students have different grades, some have higher grades, while others have lower grades. If only the students with higher grades are allowed to participate in sports or other activities, the students with lower grades would never be able to have any fun or learn additional skills. Their chances of getting a good education would decrease and some may even give up. Students who give up would not study or have any interest in school subjects and topics. When they grow older, life may become very difficult to them.

If all students in activities have a grade of B average or higher, although the class would be full of smarter students participating, it is better to have a variety of grade average students. Having a variety of different students is better for students with lower grades too. The students with lower grade averages can learn from higher grade average students. The higher grade students can help the students with lower grades and teach them in an easier way. The influence may even raise a grade C average student to a grade B average.

In conclusion, I once again state that the new school policy is not a good idea. If the policy is issued, then there will be no difference in having the higher grade average students attend a private school, and the lower grade students attend a regular school. The policy is unfair to all the students, not only the lower grade average students. I believe that lower grade average students need higher grade students' influence in school.
