Have you ever wanted to know if you can tell if someone is forcing a smile or a real smile? I agree with the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. By using this technology you can tell how your friends, parents, and even teachers are feeling.

To begin with, You wake up for school and your mom is already making breakfast for you, but you dont know how she was feeling. When you come in the room she would erase "that" expression and greet you with a smile like usual. Didnt you wish you could tell how she was feeling and do something to make her feel better? With the FACS you can. 60 percent tired, 25 percent happy, 10 percent sad, and 5 percent angry. So you hug her and tell her to go back to sleep, then you go to school.

In the meantime, you arrive at school and meet up with your friends, but you could tell that one of them isnt as "energized" as usual. You would ask them whats wrong and they would probably say "nothing" and force a smile. You know that they arent feeling great but you dont want to nag them as well. So then you would use FACS. 90 percent depressed, 2 percent happy, 5 percent tired, and 3 percent angry. You can then calculate that they are depressed because of family problem or school.

Last but not least, according to the article "we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face". Using the technology of FACS can help you "calculate" your friend or parent feeling.

Inconclusion, FACS is a technology that allows you to read people feelings and mood. What if your friend is feeling depressed and dont want to live anymore? With FACS you can help them and prevent suicide. FACS can help you "calculate" your friend or parent feeling.
