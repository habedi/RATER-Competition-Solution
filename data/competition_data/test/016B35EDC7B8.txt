Summer projects are every kids worst nightmare. They make students work when it is their time to have fun. Schools assign them out every summer to make sure students are still learning over the breaks. Normally the students are allowed to pick what there project will be about. Unfortunately students always pick something very easy that requires little time and effort. That is why I think the teachers should decide on what our projects are. If the teachers choose the project then they can do something that revolves around the class so that students can stay on track with what they are learning.

Letting the teachers decide on the projects will have a positive impact on the students like me,who dont really know what to do their projects on. It will help give us students the little push that we may need, an arrow in the right direction. However, Some parents are saying that " teachers should let the students decide since it's their break and they should get to do whatever it is that they choose." I disagree because if a student wants to do their project on a Great white shark but in class they are learning about space then their project would be pointless. Studies show that kids are most likely to do their work if they know what they are doing it on.

So teachers the next time you give your students a summer project, give them all a specific subject . Don't let them take the easy way out and write about paint drying. Have them write about something that they are going to learn about in the future. Don't make something that students will have to slave over for hours a day,let them have some fun with it,it is summer break after all
