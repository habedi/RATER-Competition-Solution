Technology has advanced tremendously in the past few decades and is present throughout modern society. Therefore, educational institutions have had to evolve with these dynamic standards. For example, some schools now offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Does this practice mean progression for the educational system or will this halter young minds from reaching his or her full potential? It is evident society must change with trends but sometimes maintaining tradition is the best option, as that is certainly true in this situation. Online or video conferencing should not be offered to all high school students since this would prove to be distracting, lower human interaction among teens, and will ultimately be abused.

One factor that should be taken into consideration is the maturity level of teenagers and the majority's ability to stay focused. This is crucial because online classes are a privilege that is, sometimes, unintentionally abused. To elaborate, no one person has the exact same brain chemistry as another. Every human is similar by the shared adjective used to describe an individual that being the term unique. Moreover, this is also true for the manner in which a person will learn, since some individuals are unable to apply his or herself without the correct atmosphere. People tend to associate certain practices with places this is why many find homework a difficult task. Considering these facts online class would be almost impossible for any person without proper priorities and time management; characteristics that are obsolete in younger generations.

Additionally, online opportunities would limit teens from human interaction; therefore, depriving an individual of soft skills that will be important later in life. Social interactions between teens has become hindered drastically due to media platforms and instant messaging. If schools were to allow all students a choice between online classes or physically attending school the majority would be inclined to choose the easiest option which is video conferencing. Impacts of detrimental degrees would be obvious for teens later in life when a person is unable to resolve conflicts in the workplace or struggles with communication skills. The most important aspect of high school is not the testing or difficult classes rather it is experience with others that should be emphasized.

Finally, this form of education will be abused by students. The phrase, youth is wasted on the young, provides a prime example to support the idea teens will neglect online classes. As previously stated, experience nourishes the mind more than books or lectures ever will. That is why adolescents are ignorant; none have had enough time to know what will harm the future because to these individuals the future is now. Unfortunately, as a consequence paying attention in class might not seem as important as messaging friends or getting an extra hour of sleep. Ultimately, most teens are immature and will not take this program seriously.

On the contrary, some may argue that this would not affect students who are serious about school. Those in opposition might claim that this will progress learning since students will be in a comfortable atmosphere; however, what the opposing side fails to realize is that behaviors are associated with places. Another thing that might give clarity to the other side is that the majority of students are not completely goal oriented and would struggle to manage this.

Distractions prevailing, lower human interaction among teens, and abusing this resource are all reasons online classes should not be offered to all high school students. Technology can be positive but it is important to analyze the cons that will be present for different situations. While society continues to progress some traditions must be kept because things that are not broken do not need to be fixed. The educational system has flaws but requiring students to attend in real time at a physical institution is not an issue. Online courses should not be offered to all individuals because this is a privilege that should be earned.
