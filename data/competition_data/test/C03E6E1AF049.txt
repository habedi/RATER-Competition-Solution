Have you ever wondered why people ask more then one person for there opinions. Or what are the advantages are to it. There are lots of ways you seeking different prospective but i am going to give you three of the main.

The first reason I believe asking people for advice is good because. When asking more people you can get a new view of others perspectives. Then from there you can ask anther person to see what he or she think. For example if you are doing a project and you are stuck you can ask a friend for his or her opinion on it and possible you can get a different stet of eyes on your topic.

Anther reason seeking multiple opinions can help someone is by.

If you are not sure about what you should do you should ask someone before you don't do it because if it is something bad that friend can save you from doing it. For example if you and your friend are doing something bad you should ask a person next to you if what you are doing is allowed. I f they said it to you now you no that what you are doing is wrong and you should tell your friends that we should not do it and leave.

Finally, the last reason asking multiple people for advic e. The more people you ask the more information you will get because every person you ask has a different opinion. For example when i asked my friends about a Certain topic they all have different saying into it that is why is is important.

inconclution those are all the ways asking people for advice is good next time are stuck make sure you ask at least one person you never know maybe that can help you a lot
