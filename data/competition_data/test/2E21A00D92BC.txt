Students already have to face the embarrasment when we have to talk in front of the classsroom. We dont want something like a computer to tell us. However the technology can help us detect other thing such as in art,to get more of a pricise emotion and face expression.

Most sudents like to keep quite to themselfs. The pressuer of fknowing that someone else migh know how you feel is scary. There are things that we dont not like to share and to me my emotions are hiding. They used Mona Lisa as an exampel of how they deteced her face there is one benifit where that technology can be used. In finarts. That I do agree with.

Another benifit that can help is a theater teacher to help select the actors that use the right emotion and it will make the play/movie even better. This can be taken in a whole lot diffent ways.

In conculsin i disagree with the fact that it may leave other students in embarrsedment but i also see how far we can take it.
