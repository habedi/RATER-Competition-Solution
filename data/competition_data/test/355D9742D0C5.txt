In our world today people have so many emtions they use on a daily basis. Emotions can help someone figure out if a friend is upset or how their day is going. On the other hand Dr. Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois wanted to decode all human emotions. The way that he could decode emtions is through a system called them Facial Action Coding System. Being able to read peoples emotions can help people under stand and learn what someone is feeling.

Dr Huang wanted a better way to read peoples emptions, instead of reading every indavidual muscle in the face. Then having to figure out the emotions of thr person on their own. Having a computer system to detect the emtions is faster snd easier to detect. Dr. Huang and his collegue Dr. Sebe are "exsperts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate." The computer is built to construct a 3-D computer model of the face and all 44 muscles on the human face to detect what emotions. One reason why the system was built, was for class rooms. The system would identify the mixed emotions of the students and help solve the problems. The system would observe the students to see if they are bored, upset, confused, and more. Dr. Huang states "Then it could modify the leason, like an effective human instructor. This system would help so much in the class rooms. Even tho the system would cost alot and would be awkward for it to watch your every face muscle. But the system would help in class rooms and to help the students with their problems and needs.

The Facial Action Coding can help generations of people in the future and their emtions. The system can help with fixing problem for students and even passient of doctors. Even tho people normally communicate through talking, alot of our communication is from the faces that humans make. The emtion system will forever change the way scientists look at peoples emotions and the way they feel emotionaly forever.
