You may be questioning yourself, why is limiting car usage a good thing? How does it benefits us? Well, have you ever heard of global warming? Global warming is caused by air pollution. Global warming is destroying our planet. Therefore we need to act before its to late. How can you help? Its simple drive less, walk, and inform others about the situation. But there is other ways the government can help and that is by limiting car usage. The less amount of cars in the city the better it is.

However, countries like France, China, and Colombia have banned driving in order to clear air pollution from their cities already. In Paris they banned driving due to smog. Those who violated the rules were fined 22-euro which is $31 dollars in America. However 27 people had their car impounded due to their reaction to the fine. And around 4,000 people were fined. Then after five days of intensifying smog, the smog arrived to Beijing, China. China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. They faced major issues and blamed diesal fuel, since France has a tax policy that favors diesal over gasoline. Appearently Colombia seems to be the country that succeeded on reducing the smog. The day without car is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota, Colombia in the mid-1990s. Everyone seemed to join the movement to redue air pollution.

In other hand, president Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions will get fortuitous assist. Has America passed peak driving? According to Elizabeth Rosenthal, recent studies suggest the Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license. No one seems to bother to get drivers license. Many prefer to walk or take public transportation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Does this mean we care? I hope so.

In conclusion, the way I see it is that people dont care. Someone is trying to fix the problems while other make the problem even worse. Its like you're trying to fix you car and the next day someone destroys your car for no reason at all. Yes, some people are helping but it not enough. With your help we can help stop air pollution. Limiting car usage will definently help, because the fewer cars there are the faster we can reduce greenhouse gas. Its not the same when you have millions of vehicles in the city than when you have hundreds of them. So less car will help. We need you to join now. And dont forget to inform others what going on the world. That way we can have more people joining the fight to stop greenhouse gas.
