Have you ever wanted to learn to take photos? maybe get a taste of managing a community? How about building a hovercraft with wood and shower curtains? Well then you should sign up for a club! extracurricular activities or clubs are programs sponsored by a set of teachers that allow students to experiment and try new things and experiences that you can't normally take a class for. I believe that participating in an extracurricular activity should be mandatory for all students.

First of all, you can get insight on what you might want your career to be. For example, taking a class on CPR, basic first aid, or how to respond to an emergency might make you realize that you want to be a nurse or doctor. In the club I've taken, its a computer support club. It's shown me that in the future I want a position that involves a team, a place where I can take charge, and can fix technology problems. This shows that clubs might help narrow down job choices, with more specific subjects that broad classes can't really hit home with.

Furthermore, it could help you learn about a class that you just couldn't take because of a full schedule. An example of this is me actually. I'm interested in learning photography, but next year i'm taking Spanish and band and as such, I have to pass up on photography. However, if the school had a photography club next year, I could sign up and get a foundation on developing my hobby of photography so I could learn on my own time! this shows that clubs are the perfect opportunity to have fun with the classes that you missed out on for more important things like languages or band. This shows that clubs are perfect to help students who's schedule is just too packed for the average student

Building off of that, Clubs could teach important life skills. A few good examples are serving on the student council could teach you how to be an active member in your community, which is an amazing skill to have. Cooking club teaches you how to cook, which is literally a vital skill needed to live. Technology clubs can help you fix your own problems in a world where technology is becoming more and more important and more jobs are opening up to fix said technology. This shows that clubs not only are for fun, but they can help you live a better life overall.

Ultimately, clubs can help you pinpoint your career in life, get a taste of that one class you never got to take, and even provide you with skills needed to live in the real world. if you want to get more involved in your clubs, then you can always sign up for one, or think about sponsoring a club of your own to kick start the process and provide other with the tools for success.
