Dear TEACHER_NAME

I believe policy 1 is the best choice because it is a bad idea to not bring cell phones to school. there are 3 reasons why. What if a student misses the bus, Contact friends during lunch, Most students cant live without cell phones. But there is a way also to handle texting in class.

Student have to have a phone after school or even before school because if a student misses there bus how are they going to get a ride to school and get there on time. Sure they can walk there but most likely they are going to be late. That's one reason to have cell phones.

Also students want to contact friends if there friend is sick. If they text sick ones during class take there phone away. If it gets took 3 times send it to the office. They will get it back after school.

Students also need to have phones because they just cant live without it. But like i just said in the last paragraph take it away if there caught texting during class. Policy 1 is the best choice for students. Policy 2 just is a bad idea. For the students of SCHOOL_NAME

don't pick policy 2.
