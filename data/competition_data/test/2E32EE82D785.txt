Dear: Principal

I have written this letter to inform you that many students at this school have a C average. Many students that do in fact have a C average have complained about not being able to participate in sports or other activities. I highly suggest that you change the minimum requirement to a C average. Some students might not be able to score higher than a C average. And you may not agree with me on this, but some of the students may not get higher then a C average because of their home environment. Setting the minimum to a B average might encourage the students that currently have a C average to try harder in their classes, but some of the students might not try harder in class just because of this.

You could set the minimum to a C average and promote that the students try harder. You could even award the students that go to a B average from a C average with prizes(this could encourage others that still have a C average to improve). Their are other positive things that could be don along with changing the minimum to a C average. To offer more advise, you could brainstorm with the physical education teachers to come up with a plan on how to encourage the students that even though the minimum is a C average they should still try hard to do well in their classes(supposing that you change the minimum to a C average).

Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely: 8th grade student
