Dear principle,

Students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and free times. They should be allowed as long as they do not use them during class. Some students might need to use them during lunch for certain reasons. They might have to call their parents to bring them something that they might need. There are some real emergencies when we have to use our phone. Sometimes the office or our teachers let us borrow their phones but sometimes the emergency might be personal and the teachers might hear what you are telling your parents. There are times at lunch that you just have to use your phone for any reason.

Another reason why you might need to use your phone during lunch might be because of the food. Maybe you are allergic to something and you are really hungry you can call your parents to bring you something. Another situation might be that we are feeling sick during free time and our teacher doesn't believe us we can call our parents so they can come to pick us up. What would you do if you just feel really sick but you don't want to go home we can call someone to bring us medicine so we can feel better. Or maybe you forgot your homework and your teacher doesn't let you call from the office you can call from your own phone.

There are many reasons why we should be allowed to use our phones at least during lunch or during free time. That's the whole point in having a cell phone if you can't even use it until the afternoon? They should at least let us use it during our free time and during our lunch. We are not doing any harm in using our phones during a period where all you do is eat and have fun. Anyways and sometime the lunch period id so boring you just want to talk to someone else that you hardly see during the day. After all there is some people who do use their phones behind the teachers back because that's the only way you can use it during school hours. if they catch you using your phone all they do is take it way and you get it back. and when they finally say that they aren't going to give it back until the end of the year your parents are going to mad but then their just going to buy you a new phone . That's why principles should just allow us to use them during our free time and our lunch time.
