Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, by way of online or video conferencing. It would greatly benefit students who cannot go to school due to an illness, as they wouldn't miss any of the course work that they would otherwise spend time on caching up on, and they would not fall behind the rest of their classmates. For example, if a student is not able to go to school for a specific time period due to an illness, then that student can take the offer of distance learning as an option instead of missing out on classes and course material while they are not able to go to their class.

Distance learning could also help students who don't feel safe at schools a better chance to learn, as if a student isn't comfortable in their working environment, then it would be difficult for them to learn, and rather they stay home and miss out of their school work due to the felling of not being safe in their environment, distance learning would greatly benefit them by way of video conferencing their classes at their pace at their own home, a place that may be seen as safer by these students.

One thing to note is that perhaps other students who can physically go to school may abuse their right of skipping school and instead take online classes when they don't have the need too, however to that claim, it is better for them to still learn the coursework and skip school then for them to skip school and pay the price by missing their classwork.

Distance learning also help students by just being an option available, as they wouldn't have to then stress about missing school if they're sick or unable to go, as they would then have distance learning abilities as a backup.

In conclusion, the inclusion of distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online of video conferencing would benefit students such as those whom, cannot go to school due to an illness, and those don't feel safe at school. Distance learning would also help the general student population by just being an option if the occurrence arises that they might miss school for an indefinite period of time.Â
