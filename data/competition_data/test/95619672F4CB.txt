Dear Principal,

I believe that changing the schools cell phone policy so we can have our phones out during lunch and other free periods is a very smart and wise idea. The reason why i believe so strongly in this reason is because students all ready use their phones during class, lunch, hallways, and other areas around the school. But if you instil this change of policy the chances are there would be less students texting or using there phones in class because they all ready have a time in the day to use their phones without getting in trouble. But if you do pass the policy in which we are not aloud to phones in the school building, the chances are that students will still bring them, still play with them, and will still definitely text with them in class. However if you pass the policy where we are aloud to bring them and use them in our free time then there will be a lot less students getting in trouble for texting on their phones. Phones can be distracting but they aren't going to go away and with time they are going to become more and more popular. So i feel it's better to embrace it rather then just to push it away and pretend that, that rectangle in our pocket isn't our phones because i can ensure you that it probably is.

Sincerely,
