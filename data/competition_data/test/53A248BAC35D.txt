Dear Principal,

Students should do community service. You could do community service with a bunch of friends so it would not be so boring. Doing community service looks good on a college application. I have done some community service before and it is not bad. It feels good to help people in need for something or to clean up places the definitely need it.

I think students should do community service on their own time. I would do it because I like tutoring or going to a senior citizens home and helping out there. I love to see the looks on their faces when someone helps them. I love to work with children, they are so funny and are always cheerful. Cleaning up a highway or even a neighborhood is good community service and you are helping out the planet.

Doing community service is not a bad thing. You could get a couple of your friends and go help people or clean up places. You could make the best out of it. Community service does not have to be miserable. Being with your friends will make it all better. You can make it fun and enjoyable.

Students should do community service because it looks good on a college application. Colleges look at your records of community service. It could be the debate on weather you get into the college or not. When you do a lot of community service you can get into a college a lot easier. I am striving to do a lot of service so I can have a better future because i went to a great college.

In my opinion, I think students should do community service for various reasons. When you do community service it makes you feel good that you helped out others and the environment. Also it is not that hard to pick up the street or help out at a retirement home. Therefore students should do community service.
