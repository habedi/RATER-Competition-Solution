Dear principal,

I think you not change the policy that students have to have a B average so that we can have more people on the teams for sports to help the school and get more people to help the school. Like getting new equipment for the boys and girls to play with like new footballs weight lifting and more for gym to exercise and have fun.

Some more reasons are that a lot of boys and girls have c average and want to play sports for the school and help the school with found raisers and along with making the school better for kids and adults. From a boy/girls view it would be unfair for them because they could not participate in the sport they like or the activity they like to play in.

The last reason that i have is that the boys and girls need to have a say in this so we can decide if would be wrong or right thing to do for the school or for the kids along with adults with funding the school or donating money to get equipment for the boys and girls to play the sprot or activity with. a B average is a bit much to play a sport or be in a activity. Like what ifthe sprot or activity only had C average students that's why the students need a say in this.

Sincerely,
