Changing the policy to where only students with a B average to join sports is not a good idea to me. The reason I think this is a bad idea is because most of the students that are athletic have at least a 2.0. I like the way the schools are only requiring a 2.0 to join. If you do this and change to 3.0 you will most likely have less people join or try out for the teams. I think the most important thing here is the students should be athletic.

Most students are only in school for the athletic stuff. If you raise the GPA most students will drop out. They will drop out for the fact that they cant make it a B in the time they need it. C average is good enough because it is average.

My friends that are athletic and join Football or Baseball are not that smart. I'm not saying they are dumb, they just don't hold the highest GPA. They make a 2.0 cause that's where they are in school. They don't have to bust their butts just to join, when they can just go to a community center and pay and don't have to worry about their grades. If you change it to a 3.0 most students will drop out and think they will end up being a famous Football player or Baseball player ect.

Just like the passage said, most students have a C average. Why would you change it to B and just lose all the people who actually participate? Most students that don't already participate are in the streets smoking weed or doing other drugs. These sports help kids stay off the streets and keep them clean. They have something to enjoy and do.

Why would they wanna do drugs right?

Those are the reasons why I think changing the school policy would be a bad idea.
