If it is Summer break for a student and teachers assign them projects to do over that time, would it be easier and/or more efficient for the student to design their own project or, for the teachers to design it for them ?

Here's why teachers designing the projects for the student makes more sense.

Firstly,due to the fact that if the students are given a teacher designed project they'll most likely have more of an outline of instruction or better direction in which to take it, otherwise the students may not know what to do at all and come up with nothing, The student, if given the chance to design their own may make it too easy for themselves and ultimately learn nothing new over break, Finally the teacher has the opportunity to make something they know the student will be able to understand and manage (as long as they know the student well enough).

Going into more detail with each of these examples now; if the teacher doesn't design a project for the student they may become overwhelmed or confused as stated previously, they could easily lose track of what they're doing because the stress of school holds little weight over them because it is summer and they don't feel the urge to take it as seriously.

However if the teacher does this and makes clear, understandable instructions on what to do and how to do it, the student may feel less overwhelmed or lost, and end up getting it done in a reasonable amount of time and with a good grade as well.

Additionally, if the students make it, they could very well make it TOO easy for themselves without prior outlining of what to do, such as a poster or something of that caliber. All the student needs to do to get it finished is slap a couple pictures on it and write down minimal information about whatever they may be creating that project for. If students were to take such an easy route, the chances of them retaining that information is extremely low.

Finally, the final in depth example on why teachers should make summer projects for their students if their school participates in this rule, Teachers are more than likely reachable over the course of the Summer if the students are still confused as to what they're doing thus making the help of a teacher via email available.

This all isn't to say that there aren't any perks to the students designing these themselves (assuming the student is responsible);

An argument could be brought on to some of these examples saying, maybe if the student doesn't like the project the teacher has created for them, the student could become bored and uninterested, leaving them with a creativity block, that just makes them want to go and do things that their Summer break is for. As well as The student may work more diligently and productively in general if they have creative freedom to do what they want, or can imagine going well with their projects. Third and finally, if the student has no creative freedom they could unintentionally spend more of their break doing something was given to them to do than they had initially thought.

Though there are valid examples for either side to choose from, the side in favor of teachers designing said projects, overall out weighs the other. The percentage of students who can work well from a standard academic point, to the percentage of students who work better at their own pace and creativity level is unequal but, Students with standard learning skills greatly out number the creative working students on average, in most places at least.

Again, teachers provide more help to a greater number of students, They create an outline of instruction, and they keep most students from cheating and making things too easy for themselves.

In conclusion either side could potentially be chosen to argue from but, the question still stands, Would it be easier for teachers or students to create these projects ?
