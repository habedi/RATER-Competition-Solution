I disagree with the principle's policy to make it so that you need at least a B average in each class.

My reasons are that GPA is more important than your overall performance in each class, activities help kids socially, and not letting kids play on a team would hurt the kid's future and the school's reputation.

First off, I think that being able to do after school activities should be judged on GPA instead.

A student shouldn't be punished for not excelling in one particular subject.

Someone could get one C in a class and in the other classes do well.

For example, a student could have all A's except for one C and he would still have a GPA of above a 3.5.

In this particular situation, the student would have a passing GPA and he deserves to be able to do after school activities.

Next, students with poor grades deserve not to be an outcast or an anti-social kid.

The kids already are struggling to keep up their grades and not being able to socialize and make friends at an activity will make that problem occur.

For example, if a student didn't get along with the people in his academic classes, then he could join an after-school activity or sport of his liking where he could meet people who share the same interests as him.

Also, it is thought that after-school activities are a good way to get better grades.

My last reason is that not letting a person do an after school activity or sport would actually hurt the school in some ways and actually make the kid's future even worse.

In an athlete's situation, not allowing him to play of the high school's team would make it so they don't learn how to play with a team or to improve at a good rate.

Also, the schools sports teams might be hurt as well if their best player has a grade average of under a B.

In conclusion, you should be able to have a grade average of below or above a B to be able to participate in after-school activities.
