Dear, Principal

I think you should make it mandatory for your students to perform community service. It would benefit the community with your students helping out and may change several students. Most students don't do anything important after school or on there free time so it would give them something to do and it would be helpful to everyone. Just think about it which one do you think would be better for a student to do, tutor children or sit and watch television all day. Community service would only take a few hours giving them enough time to complete their home work and giving them time to do whatever hobby they enjoy. It would be better for them to help the community because it would make the community a better place. With people helping out especially with students, most likely they will learn something from their experience helping out the community. Since their are a lot of students their would be a lot of people helping out. It would help out and give the students something to do, consider adding community service to your school.
