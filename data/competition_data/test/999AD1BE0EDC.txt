Gas has a horrible smell and its bad for the economy and environment. What makes it worse is that its coming out of you're own car. In Germany they have given up their cars in the way that, there's more space for more beneficial builldings and for homes instead of a parking garage and another reason is it takes stress off of the driver.

Cars are taking up lots of space that could be usesd for beneficial buildings like schools, hospitals, banks and etc. We don't need cars to live our life's we're to reliant on them and our ecoconomy revolves around cars and to society the type of car you have defines you. We'll no it's not true. We need to stop being spoiled and think about our environment and those around us because if the people in Germany and Paris can do it, so can we. This is an advantage because we can learn to take care of ourselves and you can save lots of money instead of buying a car.

Do you ever feel tense when you're in you're car driving? I do, and I sit in the passenger seat. I'm always afraid that someone could be drunk driving or just driving recklessly and hit you're car. Some could be afraid because they don't want ticket and scared to be pulled over. It's very stressful to have to pay so much attention to the road and prevent accidents and what not. This could be an advantage because it could be considered safer, and it take's alot of stress off of you, mentally and physically.

There are lots of reasons why cars are a big advantage whether or not it seems valid just give it a try, and maybe our economy will get better. I'm not saying not to use you're cars at all because it's yours just limit your usage.
