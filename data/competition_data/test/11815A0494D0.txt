Venus is one, if not the most interesting planet in our solar system. Next to Mars, and the moon, we have put all of our scientific power into studying this very strange yet interesting planet. At one point in time along the scale of our vastly universe, Venus had the closest living conditions to our home, Earth. The planet has mountains, valleys, and space material impacts. Venus is so fascinating and important to us that we, as a race, are willing to put our lives in danger to explore the unknown planet.

In the passage it says, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." The meaning behind this sentence showcases that we should not be afraid or unwilling to explore the unknown just because we are scared of what we do not know that is out there. We can not stay on Earth forever. The planet is going to die eventually. We also have concerns of natural resources, over-population, and food density. Which indefinitly means that we need to find a new suitable planet for us, as a race, to strive and survive.

If we do not adapt and overcome our stay on Earth we are smuthering and destroying all the hard work, as a race, that we have put to this planet. Just like in nature, animials are forced to moved from their natural habitats and have to adapt to just simply survive. If we can not do the same we will end up with a much more impactful, dangerous situation. That's what we, as a race, strive on is knowing the unknown. In conclusion, we must always be evolving and adapting to stay ahead of the game.
