Dear principal,

I feel that policy two is the best because students dose not need the sell phone they should be more worried about there education. If students have an phone with them most of them will not have it turned off like they should have so that's why i say it is not an good thing to have in school. It will just be an discretion for students. then the students will get mad that the teacher took there phone they will have to wait until there mom or dad or an family member comes to get it. I did not say this that's he time the teacher will have to waste getting the phone from the students because they know some will not give there phones to them then they will have to stop class to call someone to get that person out the class so the rest can learn an it is no good for the one who had the phone out because he or she going home or iss an that not good for him or her because they are messing learning to.
