Dear Principal,

There are two policies that have been presented to you I believe that cell phones should be allowed because they are import to keep in touch with your parents. Like in case of a lock down or a fire. Cell phones should be allowed in schools but off in class because you need to be in touch with your parents.

The reason your parents got you the cell phone in the first place is so it is easy to talk to talk to them incase of emergencies and if you want to got to a friends house.

In fourth grade there was a lock down at my school and since i had a phone i called my dad, who in a policeman, and he was able to make calls and get me picked up and able to go home.

Also i can call my parents if they aren't with me to see if a friend can come over or I can go to a friends house. Yesterday I want to see if i could go over to a friends house but my mom said no but then I called her back and ask if my friend and I could go on a bike instead of him coming to my house.

Others might say that cell phones are distracting but if we have them turned off in class they can't use them, there for they can't be distracting.

They also might say that cell phones are too expensive but you can get most cell phone for fifty dollars and most phones last you two, three even four years.

Therefore i believe that Policy Two should be accepted because it is important to be connected to your parents incase of emergencies like a lock down, a fire and any other emergencies, and if you want to do something after school with there friends.
