This technology is kinda dumb. We don't need this to be able to tell how a person is feeling. You can just tell by their facial expressions and how their moods are. Like it said in pharagraph 8 " Muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes". "In a fake smile you can tell the difference between a real smile and a forced one because in a fake smile the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic mayjor and different muscle, the risorius."

So no I really don't think it's something we need to be able to tell how a person is feeling. We already know how people feel when they're are around because of their moods and their facial expressions. I guess it can be a good thing to use for the people that are not good with facial expressions, they can use this technology to be able to understand how a person is feeling.
