I think that driverless cars are an amazing example of what humans are capable of doing. I also believe that they can be dangerous. They can really become a big help to society if they can make them as safe as possible.

The reason I think the driverless cars could be dangerous is because they could lead to wrecks. In paragraph 2 it says that the car alerts the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. The driver might not be paying attention and if he doesn't take over the wheel, that could lead to an accident. The driverless cars do offer great things that could help us. In paragraph 1 the article tells us that the cars use half of the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.

My conclusion is that we should take some more time with these driverless cars. I think we should work on them more and make them even smarter than they already are. This is the best option because it could make them even safer and that is the most important thing.
