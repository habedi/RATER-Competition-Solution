The Electoral College consists of 528 electors. in order for the popular vote tobe valid, an Electoral Colege should continue as is. The Electoral College is a wide range of people whoÂ  know what it is thta they want. The Disrrict of Columbia is even considered to be a state just for the Electoral College purpose. The people of America choose their electors in which when they choose their Presidential candidate, they are choosing it's electors. The people of America are practically setting themselves up for whatever outcome comes into play.

Some people claim that people are not voting for the president, but are voting for the slate of electors. These people, however, are simply dramatic and have no sense as to what is actually going on in their country. People do no tvote for a president just because of his or her electors. Presidents are elected because they, as a candidate to be a president, have somehow persuaded the majority of the country to vote for them on their own behalf. A good president is elected because he or she is a good president, not because he or she has good candidates behind them. Yes, with a president comes his or her electors, but the electors are not the ones running for president, therefore they are not the ones persuading the people of America to vote for them, for it is the president that is doing the persuading, and the president that is receiving the votes.

The Electoral College has worked for many many years in the past and if held with respect will continue to work an be a successful way and form of voting. The outcomes will be valid and the responses will be accurate with reasonableactions following it.

The disaster factor is a claim that goes against the Electoral College, however it is not worthy of being a factor. A tie in the Electoral College is not likely, and if it were to happen, it could easily be resolved.
