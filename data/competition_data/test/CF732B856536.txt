The facal reconition is not a good idea because then if you are relaxed the computer might think you are mad or upset. The best thing for this program is to not usit for school computers but for phones. having emotion reconition is not the best idea.

The reasson it would not be a good idea is because in paragraph 4 "using video imagry,the new emotion-recogonition softwhere tracks your facial movements...". This could lead to malfunctions with the computer and why would we need to be told our emotion if we already know what our emotion is.

also the money you would need to buy the specal computer and the softwhere could get really exspencive.

The money factors in because in paragraph 7 " your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile". The amount of money you would have to spend for a new computer would be a lot and from what it sounds like it is a computer that people cant even carry around with them. What if the computer has a bunch of malfunctions too then what all that money was wasted o something that doesnt even work.

People would also have to worrie about others trying to hack the computer even if there is a fire wall to protect it. Schools shouldnt have the emotion reconition in there classes because the teacher would know if a student was confused and didnt know how to do the homework because they would ask for help.

Inconclusion the emotion reconition is not a good idea because poeple dont want to carry around a computer just to know what their emotion is. People know what there emotion is with out the special computer. The facial recogonition is just a bad idea.
