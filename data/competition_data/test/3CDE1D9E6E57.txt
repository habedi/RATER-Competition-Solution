One topic that is frequently debated in some societies is if schools should offer distance learning as an option to benefit their students. Parents would disagree with the thought of having their kids staying home and learning but I believe that students should have distance learning as an option and let me tell you why. Every student learns at a different pace, students often debate on showing up or staying home from school, and not all students require the same classes.

First reason why i believe distance learning is beneficial and should be offer at schools is because not every student learns at the same pace. Some students would require a little more time on an assignment as the others would not. I grew up in a community where teachers didn't ask if you'd understood the lesson, or if you needed help, they would just keeping moving forward, which had a huge negative impact in my grades. Having one on one lessons with teachers and getting the proper education without actually being there, but through a computer screen on the other side of the state is a game changing experience that students would love and should be willing to choose from.

Second reason why i think online or video conferencing is beneficial to students is because like most students, they wake up exhausted in the morning, and debate whether they want to go to school or stay home. Missing a whole day of school instead of starting at the time you want could really hold you back from getting your education. I have a friend who chooses to stay home instead of coming to school because he feels like once he gets to school no one helps him, but when he would take his classes online he would have all of his work done and still have time to start on the next lesson. Online classes are very beneficial to students who find school difficult.

Third reason to why i believe students should require online learning as a benefit is because not every student can get the subject or class required for graduating at their school. Many students shouldn't require taking all the basic classes if its not necessary, if a student is focusing on becoming an architect they should mainly take classes for that instead of classes to become something else. Online classes also give students time to reflect and explore more learning options.

As you have read i believe, that students should get the opportunity of getting online or video conferencing as it does help students to focus, get their work done, and farther their education.
