On May 24, 2001 25 years ago something wierd happend on Mars. Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars, taking pictures of landing places for its sister ship. While taking pictures the Vicking saw the shadowy likeness of a human face. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time ever. Michael Malin and and his Mars Orbiter Camera, took picturse 10 times shaper then then from the preveous Viking picture. After that they conclued that there was no alien monument after all.

On April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor came realy close for a second look. Garvin said this " We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center the Face in look." Malins team got an really extraordinary picture of the face, by using camera's absolute maximum resoltion.

In the 2001 Viking photo its spans 1.56 meters, in 1976 Viking photo comaperd to 43 meters per pixel.

After all of the studies and looking at the picturese, what the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa. They are landforms common in West American. Its a lava dome that takes a form of a isolated mesa its about the same size and height as the face of Mars. So thats why the pictue is just a natural landform. And not alien artifact.
