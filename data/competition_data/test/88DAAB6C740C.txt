The president is our leader. And you don't want some people picking who your next leader is gonna be. I think we should change to the popular vote because in the Electoral college you don"t get to vote for your president and it's unfair to voters. How do we know who we're voting for if we vote for somebody else to vote for us. Just let the people vote for who they want.

In the Electoral college you don't vote for the president, you vote for somebody to vote for you. What if he decides to pick the other competitor? You wouldn't know. In the popular vote you get to vote yourself. Bradford Plumer says ''Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.'' [Source 2, Paragraph 10] I wouldn't want somebody voting for me. I'd rather do it by the popular vote and vote myself. It's not even fair for the people.

It's not fair at all. Even Bradford Plumer agrees with me. He says ''It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.'' [Source 2, Paragraph 14] He also says ''...the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning...'' [source 2, Paragraph 13] That's not fair at all. They only go to states they know they're going to win.

Some people may say that they trust the slate of electors. Richard A. Posner says ''...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...'' They 'rarely' betray the president's votes. It really does matter if its just once in a while because when they betray the votes that prsident has to stay for four years. I wouldn't trust them with my vote. They could betray them just like that. And we could be stuck with the wrong prsident that nobody wanted.

I wouldn't trust the electoral college. I would trust in my own vote. I'm not going to let someone else vote for me. They might pick the wrong president. Its just not fair to the people, to give there vote to someone else. This goverment is by the people for the people. By the people. That means we should vote oursleves. Not give our vote to some people that can turn their back on you in a heartbeat.
