I think driverless cars will be a good invention for the future. I don't think we will have to pass a driver's test to get to drive one. This will save time out of our days that we spend studying and practicing to pass those permits and tests. Although these cars aren't completely driverless yet, I believe we will get there soon and our progress on it is fascinating. "Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."

Driverless cars have been thought of since around the late 1950's, it's just people or companies didnt have the technology, we have today, to make them. The cars also save money spent on gas and repairs. The article says, "The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."

To conclude, yes I believe driverless cars are the way to the future. They will benefit us more than they will do harm, if any. Many companies have already started building their own edition of driverless cars. BMW have cars that steer, accelerate, and brake on their own, but even they sill need driver's assistance. And what about the driver's laws, will you have to be 18 to get one of these futuristic cars, or will there even be an age limit since the driver won't do anything? " Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."
