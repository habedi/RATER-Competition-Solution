In today's world technology has taken over. Driverless cars are starting to develop. Is this a good or bad thing? Some may see it as good, but in my opinion driverless cars are a bad thing.

Driverless cars have more risks rather than a human operated vehichle. One of those risks or concerns that was pointed out in the article is what if the technology is to fail? If the car is operating on it's own and a wreck happens; who is to blame? Is it the manufacturer for faulty technology or the driver? Either way this would cause more problems with who's fault it would be if a wreck were to happen and could cause major legal troubles. Another thing that goes along with technology failur is the safety of everyone in the vehicle and everyone around. The technology would not be able to sense a problem or poor driving conditions like a human operator would be able to. The technology would not be able to react and adjust to these situations.

Another downside the article pointed out was the driverless cars are not entirely driverless. The car would still need an operator to be allert and ready to take over. So what is the point of a driverless car if they still need an operator? The point the article made, "Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?" This is a relateable statement it would get boring sitting there having to be allert but not doing anything. It would get really tiring after a wile. The article talked about putting in-car entertainment in the cars, but if someone were too invested in the entertainment of the car they would not be allert if the car would need the operator to take over. This could cause crashes and put the safety of people in danger.

Driverless cars are not a good idea. They have not figured out the legal work that would go along with it. If a car were to crash they have no way of knowing who is at fault. The safety of people is put at risk. The cars are not even completly driverless they still need an allert operator ready to take over if a problem occured. Driving should be the responsibility of a human not a computer. Driverless cars are not where our future should be heading.
