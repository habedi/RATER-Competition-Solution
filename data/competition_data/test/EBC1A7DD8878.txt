Picture this you walk into school one day to an announcement from your principal saying that extracurricular activities will be made mandatory. Your'e appalled, but I'm here to convince you its not so terrible and may actually be beneficial for you and your community. Extracurriculars can keep kids out of trouble, get them into better colleges, help the community, and allow them to meet new people and try new things.

Getting invested in an extracurricular activity is a great way to steer you away from a bad path. You may not have the time to do these things if all your time is being taken up by extracurriculars. It might also make you not want to do drugs or alcohol as they could affect your performance in one of these activities such as sports or a club that requires mental skills.

Extracurricular activities can greatly improve the chances of you getting in the college you want. Getting into a good college can effect your job therefor the entire rest of your life, so starting some extracurriculars can be very important not just for college but onward into your career.. It has often been shown that students with lower grades but high numbers of extracurriculars have higher acceptance rates than their counterparts with higher grades but lower amounts of extracurriculars. Colleges also like to see students who help their school communities. A great way of helping your school's community is through extracurricular activities as they do of cost you anything and are easy to enroll into.

Many extra curricular activities can help your school or local community. One example of a way to help your school's community is the yearbook committee as it helps out with creating the yearbook for that year in turn helping your school's community. The same could be said with your local community and an extracurricular that helps feed the homeless or donates to charities. Even though there are many ways to help your community extracurricular activities are a free way that requires little to no effort to become a member of one of them.

Extracurricular activities can help you meet new people and try new things. You can meet people who have similar interests to you. Meeting new people can benefit students social skills. When constantly put into a scenario in which you are using a skill that you're bad at just like anything else practice makes perfect and that applies for socializing as well. For instance if you do a baseball club you will find people who probably play baseball making it much easier to find new friends. You may also want to do something that interests you but you have never tried it before. Who knows it may become your new favorite hobby or a future career path you could opt to take.

While your principal may not actually be making extracurricular activities mandatory I would highly encourage everyone reading this to go out and take at least one. They could keep you out of trouble, get you into a good college, help your community, and help you meet new people. So go out and sign up for something and who knows maybe you'll love it.
