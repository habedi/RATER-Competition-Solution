Today there are many reasons why we should and should not have car. One of the main reasons is air polution so many people are bying cars and all these cars are creating all this polution. The United States Enviromental protection agency is promotting cars to be reduced. After near record polution, Paris baned driving to clear some of the air. I do believe cars cause a huge disavantage to our clean air but i do not agree with banning people from driving gassed cars, But It would be better for the environment if people would start buying electric cars (hybrid) because some dont run off of gas and some use very little gas. Using these electric cars will benifit everyone because it cost less instead of buying gas and it leaves cleaner air in our environment. Even if lets say forty percent of United States citizens used electric cars that would still leave a huge roll in having cleaner air for us to breath, But if we all do switch to electric cars then cities need to provide cargers for cars like this so that if we are out for a while and our cars battery dies we can charge the car, I think people dont use these cars as much because they think well what happenes if my cars battery dies then there screwed. So i believe if they came out with chargers and bigger cars for families then more people would want to participate in joining an electric car, Because this wont just be saving them money this is also saving some of the air that we breath.
