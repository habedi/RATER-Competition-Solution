"I'm signing you up for science olympiad this year", my mom said. I replied with,"No I don't want to". I thought signing me up for science olmpiad was unreasonable because I already had such a busy scheldule. Nonetheless, my mom ended up signing me up anyways. I started with a stubborn mindset, but soon I began to really enjoy it. With this I saw for myself the positive effect of being well-rounded. In this prompt, we are asked about whether or not students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with this decsion for reasons including personal enjoyment, future success, and the opportunity to meet new people.

Firstly, students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it might expose them to new things they would have never considered before. For example, my mom made my brothers sign up for chess. They were very hesitant at first, but by the end of the session they were devasted that it was already over. If they had never tried it, then they would have never known that it was actually something they loved doing.

Secondly, participating in at least one activity can lead to success in the future. Working on skills earlier is always better than later. This is why school clubs and other extracurriculars are so great. It gives students the opportunity to work on their skills at a young age. Some clubs in particular can help you build your resume for college or other schools. One example is the National Honor Society. This club shows colleges that you work hard towards your grades and can maintain them well.

Lastly, joining an extracurricular activity can lead students to meet new people with the same passion. For example, joining any sports team is a wonderful way to meet and work with new people that you can become close to. This is evident in my own life when I joined a volleyball team. I met many new people and had a great time working with all of them.

I do understand though that having all students participate in at least one activity can be time consuming for some, especially ones with a heavy workload afterschool. Despite this opposing reason, I agree with the decision because of entertainment, success, and new people. In the near future, I hope that many more schools can implement similar decisions so that students everywhere can experience the same benefits.Â
