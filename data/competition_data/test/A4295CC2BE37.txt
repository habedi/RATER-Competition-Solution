Phones & Driving

In this society phones have become a big part of our everyday lives. Many people use them when there eating, watching tv, while at work, and mainly when their driving. It's okay to use your phone in public and all but, when it comes to using your phone while driving it can cause major problems. It can cause accidents or ruin some one's life forever. This could haunt a person for a long time so, in my opinion people shouldn't drive and use their phones and this is my reason on why not to.

My reason is it's a major distraction for adults and mainly teens. An example would be texting and driving, this has caused many deaths for a lot of teens and ruined others' lives because of It. A reason why teens text and drive are they don't see the consequences for it. Another would be They are always in a hurry to give information and the last reason is Teen's nowadays are hook to their phones and don't have patience to wait. These are some reasons why teens text and drive and there should be a way to stop them from using it and I believe there's a way to prevent it.

One way to prevent this is by putting your phone out of reach this way you don't get distracted by the text messages and notifications that pop up. Another way is putting your phone on do not disturb this causes your messages to make a noise and don't show anything but only emergency calls. If your using your phone for GPS than its best to mount it on the dashboard. Last would be committed to not using your phone while driving and learn the consequences to it. If people knew the risk of using their phones while driving and how many people have lost their life to it, they would think twice in one article it talked about why not too and therefore and here's is why.

In this article written by Lauren Bennet named 10 fact of texting and driving she states the "People who text while driving are 6 times more likely to get into an accident than those who drive while intoxicated". This goes to show how its more dangerous than being intoxicated while driving. There's a lot more to this article like how 520 pedestrians are hit each year by a person using their phone or how 64% of accidents are from being distracted by a phone. A lot can be said about this article and there's a lot of problems that can be prevented and there actually is in some states there actually making it illegal to use your phones while driving. An example of one in Georgia.

In Georgia we are not allowed to text and there are no restrictions on handheld cell use for anyone else. In other places like Alabama teens that are 16 or 17 that have had their license less than a year are the only ones not allowed to use their phones. Another would be in Connecticut All handheld cell use and texting is banned. Each state is different, but this has caused a difference and has caused less crashes and should be in forced in many other places. This can make a changed and help teens grow to their fullest and enjoy their youth from one small mistake with a big consequence.
