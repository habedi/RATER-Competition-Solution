Have you ever thought of how future cars may look like? With technolongy rapidly increasing each year, in the next couple of years cars might be the ones doing all the driving without the need of people controlling it. In other words, in the future there could be the invention of driverless cars. Now, do you think this would be a good idea or not so much? Well, in the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, the author points out a few postitive and negative features.

Since a few years ago Google modifies a Toyota car into a smarter car. A couple of these upgrades involoved the wheels to include a sensor and a Dubbed LIDAR, which allowed the driver to be constantly notifies of the car/s surrounding. This it's self is very useful. It caused the number of accidents to decrease due to the driver being constantly notified. Of course these are all examples of postiive features of a car, but do not make the car completely driverless.

Another major feature was a development called, "Traffic Jam Assistant'. This new develpoment did not quite make the car completely driverless either. Although it did involve the driver not to control the car as much. This feature had the ability to get the driver where they needed to be as long as there was'nt any need for human skills. Even if there was'nt any need of human skills, one still had to be aware of the road. Mainly this feature made driving easier but not completely driverless.

Towards the end of the article the author points out a couple negative aspects. The author mentions that safety is best assured when the driver is in control of the car at all times. So, in reality having a driverless car would not be the best or safest idea. That is because, if complete driverless cars would come to invention the car would be completely running through technology. Technology is not always assured. The technologu that makes the car safely drive on its own may fail which will lead to an accident without the alert of the driver.

Overall, in my opinion I do not think driverless cars would be a good idea. I think it would lead the number of accidents per year increase rather than decreasing or staying stable. I do think having those new developments of technology are helpful into making the driver more caution though. These new developments still require the driver to be fully aware of the road and their surroundings. Unlike driverless cars, they would seem to allow the drivers to "relax". This would cause drivers not to have a quick response in case of an accident where the technololgy of the car fails or for any apparent reason. Driverless cars do sound fun and nice at first, but once you take your thoughts into more deepth I do think you would be second thinking your thoughts. Not only will this development cause one to put themselves in danger, but also other cars along the road wth them.
