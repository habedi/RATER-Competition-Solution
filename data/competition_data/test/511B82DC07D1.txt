Dear, Principle

I think that you should ask the students of our school to volunteer for the work of community service. This is easier because if you make community service a school requirement you will have complaints from the student's parents of making their child work in community service.

The volunteers will actually help you in working with you to help our city be a better cleaner place, or help the people who actually need the help you give to them. For example, the great state of Louisiana still needs help recovering from Hurricane Katrina, maybe you could make that a school field trip for the volunteers at our school to do some community service there. I know I would fell good helping all the parents and children get food, water, fresh clothing, and more.

Another thing you can make a school field trip is, go to Africa to help the people in starvation there, it would help their self concisions to have a full stomach and a full year supply of food and water there to. Yes the flights will be expensive, but I am willing to guess that 2 or 3 of our students, including me, will go with you to help those innocent people.

Another suggestion is just run a fundraiser for all the kids in our school to donate some food or water, canned goods, shirts, shoes, pants, even underwear for these people to use.

Thank you, if you have any questions, please write me back at the return address.

Sincerely

P.S.

you should also look in to joining the salvation army to help out other people here in our city, make sure you get some kids to join to, they might want to help also, and tell them to ask their friends to join the salvation army, the more the marryer!!
