In this passage it introduces this mission on traveling to Venus, a planet in our solar system. In the beginning of this passage we are pointed towards the dangers to this mission, but also devices that can encourage astronauts and humans to accomplish this challenging mission.

Venus has often been referred to as Earth's "twin." With scientists attempting to study venus has been a challenge due to the risk of getting there. According to the author, "no spacecraft has lasted more than a few hours." Venus has toxic substances that clouds the atmosphere. According to the passage, "due to the extreme weather nothing will be able to last."

NASA has thought of constructing a vehicle that can hover over the planet and take photographs and videos to study the differences and similarities between earth. This vehicle will be 30 miles or more above Venus and the astronauts will send in information. More importantly, researchers cannot have samples of the life on this planet , which would be more effecient than the pictures. Another project could be the computer from the 1800s despite the technology back then it would be reliable ,because the power and it does not require electronics at all.

The worthy pursuit of this dangers have to be really thought out before traveling to this risky planet. It's effectiveness due to the ways to study it is low but can be very relieving to reach.
