Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The type of these summer projects vary from school to school. There is no definitive school project. But, there is a argument over whether summer projects should be student-designed, or teacher-designed. These summer projects should be student-designed as it allows students to express their creativity, and allows students to be able to balance their social lives and the summer project.

Summer is meant to be a break, to allow students to rest and get ready for the new school year. This means they could be able to design their project non-traditionally, because chances are, they're a little exhausted from the traditional tests, projects, and quizzes. Students could even enjoy their selves while doing the project. For example, a student may want to do a project on the wildlife of the Chesapeake Bay. So instead of researching this from home, they could go to a conservation area to interact with the wildlife and talk to the rangers there. This helps make the researching process more simple to process. This also allows the student to present their subject about they're passionate about, comparing that a assigned topic from a teacher that doesn't interest them as much. For example, a student may choose to do a project on the guitar, something they're passionate about. Students would be more engaged, focused, willing to learn, and enjoying the whole project. If teachers assigned them a topic, there would be a good chance none of these emotions would be generated.

While Summer can be a relaxing and exciting time of the year, it can also be one of those most busy and turbulent times of the year. Many people love to travel, do new things, and get jobs, especially students. Because of this, a traditional teacher-assigned project would require a lot of time that students just may not have. For example, since it would be a ideal time for students to get a job, they wouldn't be able to devote a lot of time to the teacher- assigned project. Although if the project was student-designed, students could be more flexible. For example, if they choose to do a project on local businesses, they could get a job at a local business. They would get paid, gain experience, and help with the project all at the same time. This way, students can choose their topic that fits right into their summer plans.

Summer is a valuable and exciting time of the year, where school is one of the last things on a student's mind during Summer. If they are assigned a project though, it should be student-designed, as it lets students be as creative as they want with the project, and allows student to manage the time used on the project, and the time used on their social lives. If students are forced to do a project over the summer, at least let them enjoy their selves a bit with it.
