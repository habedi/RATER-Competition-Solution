Cars  are starting to beome more and more expensive everday. Why pay when a person could either usea train,bike,or just walking. Stated in soure 1 "As a result, 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here..." Many people are glad that they had sold thier car because it just cost to much money for others. Therefore many people need to limit their car usage.

To begin with, Cars could have many flaws that may infect the environment or humans. Stated in source 2 "After dats of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." So because cars take in gas it may effect the environment because inside of the car is more chemicals a that comes out of the exhust system. Stated in Soure 1 "Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportation bill to be apporved this year, Mr. Goldberg said." this may be true because gas prices may go down and the environment will stay clean. However, waiting for public may mean waiting for a couple of hours. But when having a car a person can get to their event or job on time. Stated in Source 3 "The day without cars is part of an improvent campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s." Maybe if the United States started to start a campaign then maybe their wouldn't be so much smog in the air thats pulluting the environment.

Also, in America many people would never give up their cars just for the looks. Stated in Source 4 "But America's love affair withits vehicles seems to be cooling." So i guess that would be a great start for the environment for America. But how long will America last with out a vehicles? From my point of view, not for long that's my opinion. Although, stated in Source 4" Whether members of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice and school plays remains an open question." In my opinion i wouldn't take a bunch of kids on the train just to get to school or to a  soccer game and then once that is all over with then have to get back on the train just to take tem back home. Anything can happen. That's why having cars have pro's and Con's. But others may think of the train ride as bonding time or just getting to know the full team better.

Stated in Source 3 "Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic." So having cars helps everyone a lot less accidents would happen and park and sports centers are making good profit. So now everyone could be happy and go on with their life. Stated in Source 4 " With all these changes , people who stopped car cummuting as a result of the recession may find less reson to resume the habit..." I would totally agree with these , because when u stop driving it means more money and better health.

Finally, cars should be limited for many reasons. Limiting car usage would many better health and less gas, and also less accidents on the road. Stated in Source 4 New York's new bike-sharing program and its syrockiting bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new pririties." Therefore many jobs aren't complainig about the less car usage and some people aren't complaining about it. Many people should stop using cars to help the environment out and to get into shape.
