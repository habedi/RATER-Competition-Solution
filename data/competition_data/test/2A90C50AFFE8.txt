Dear principal,

I think that the community service should be an option for students. It is not fair to take time out of there lives. For example some students have sports or activities and don't have time for it. Some students enjoy spending time with there friends and family if they do community service they might not have enough time for any of that.

When a student does community service it might make them tired and not able to study for things like tests so their grades could go down. If a student cant keep there grade up there parents might make them stop community service. Sometimes if a student does not full fill there work they stay up late and might miss school. For students that can handle doing more things they could do community service. But for other students it could be hard on them.

If students are required to do it they might slack off on other things and might fall asleep in class because they have not been able to sleep maybe because of stress. when a student is stressed they cant work if they cant work then they could fail. When you think of community service you think of the time that's being taken from you. So most students don't like to do the community service. But some of them have the time to do so and decide that they want to.

student who do community service could have good grades and are able to take time to do things. but for the students who are failing or struggling could really use the time to study or maybe extra credit work. When a student has good grades there parents let them do things but if they have to do community service it doesn't help there plans with friends or family they have not seen in a while. I've heard that doing community service could get you more credits in school that you need to pass. But it also takes away the fun that some people can have. Thank you for taking time to read this letter and i hope that you will make the right choice.

Sincerely,

Student
