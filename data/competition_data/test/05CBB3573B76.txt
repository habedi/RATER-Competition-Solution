It's Not An Alien

In my opinion I don't think this is a face created by aliens becuase there are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. Maybe scientists have found unusaul things and claim aliens have created them but there is no proof that aliens are real.

The reason I think it is not a face is because in "Unmasking the ace of Mars" it said,"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this onbe had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egytian Pharoah. In the article it also says that the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavealing a natural lanform and there was no alien monument after all. They captured another image on April 8,2001, using the camera's absolute maxium resoulution. Garvin said,"You can discern things in a ditigal image 3 times bigger than the pixel size so if there were objects as big as airplanes on the ground you would be able to see them.

I think these are all good reasons to why it is not a face created by aliens. I am certain that there are more facts that state it is just a landform but those are just brief facts on why it not a face.
