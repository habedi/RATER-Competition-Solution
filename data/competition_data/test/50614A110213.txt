Dear Principal,

As an A average student I have never struggled with grades. I work hard and my effort pays off. It shows on my report card too! I only play one sport and it doesn't effect my grades much. During volleyball season (That's my sport!) I have a more organized schedule with time limits which benefits me by helping me to get my homework done, but on days with lots of homework or big games I struggle to get it done and generally miss some sleep. I think the policies should not change though because for people who struggle it is important that college should still be in their future.

Sports may be the only thing that gets them there.

From experience, I know fellow classmates with low grades often have bad backgrounds and the families behind them are not very supportive. That is not always true but it is common. That means they need a scholarship and it won't be for their grades no matter what policies and rules are in place, so they fall back on sports to provide scholarships. The policy should continue as is and will aid and promote college education for and more to young student athletes in our school.

As for extra circular activities they are only on occasion will look good on a college application and some may help to further educate students a fun, entertaining way that will hold their attentions in a place outside of school. Therefore it is also a plus to the promotion of out of school learning. Please take my opinion to heart and see the conflict at hand from our, the student body's, view point.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
