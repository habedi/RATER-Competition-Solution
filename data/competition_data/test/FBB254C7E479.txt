I think that policy 1 is better because everybody likes to text. And students would be happier but i think that they shouldn't be able to text in class because that just makes it too were there not learning anything. But i think if they can text during free times they wouldn't want to use there phones as much in class because then maybe they might take away there texting on free times privileges away.

Policy 2 i don't think would work because as soon as the teacher turns her back kids would just text anyway so if they had the privilege to text and use there phones on free time why ruin it by texting during class while the teacher is trying to teach. Also for policy 1 if they want the kids phone turned off during class then they can just check and make sure there off during class like right before they get in the class.

I think that policy 1 is a good idea because it gives the students a chance to socialize with there friends. so that can also help with kids communication skills. i think that they should do that at our school also because kids love to text and a lot of kids continue to text during class which is distracting them from learning so if they had a privilege to text on free time they would eventually get sick of texting.
