Dear Principal,

Some of my friends perform community service and have been telling me about them. I am very impressed with them. Community service is important. Its important for the people were giving servicing to and to us. Have you ever thought about requiring community service for students? I believe it would be a great thing to do! Not only could it make the students more responsible it could also make them more involved with the community.

Places we could visit could be the local library to read children's books to kids. We could also help out with bad housing and rebuilding. There are plenty of students who I know would love to do that! We could go visit retirement homes and company the retired folks. This all gives us a way to support this community and to show we really do care! After all the community as done for us, I think it should be required to have community work done.

This could be a good thing for us(the students)as well! Community service is put onto an application and you are looked at more by colleges. The community service would help more students get into colleges and would help people who need the service too. This is an opportunity to learn responsibly and to learn respect. We would get a chance to meet new people and to hear some stories from reality and to tell some stories on our own. It would give ourselves a chance to make something for someone. To make someone else feel good while we feel good as well.

If you could please think about everything I said in this letter and put community service into consideration, that would be great! I believe as a school we could we really do this and as a community as well. Making it a requirement would mean people would have to do it and it could possibly change some people. You never know what it could do but I believe it will be an excellent thing for you to do! Thanks for everything.

Sincerely,
