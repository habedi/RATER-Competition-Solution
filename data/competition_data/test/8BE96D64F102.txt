Schools assigning summer projects is a smart idea, considering most high school kids spend summer eating junk food, staying out late with friends, and then sleeping most of the day. During the summer most students have fun and dont do any school work which leaves them feeling behind and dumb when they return the next school year. Giving students the opportunity for student-designed projects does teach responsibility and freedom, however teacher-designed projects presents students with the content they need to know, its more unified, and more stuctured.

Teachers know what content students are supposted to learn throughout the school year, so they should present that content through the summer projects. This would help students gain the knowledge that kids need to aquire. A A good example is how this year at Generic_School, administration has desided to try peronal learning, personal learning means teachers are not supposted to directly teach which requires students to do projects and independent work to teach themselves. This change is new at Generic_School, but so far the outcome is not benfical for students learning. Students cant just do random projects on topics they are interesterd in learning about, that doesnt lead to being successful in gaining knowledge. Teachers should give out projects in order for kids have some kind of guide lines to follow, helping them learn what they need to know.

Not only would teachers presenting the correct content help kids learn, it would also make it more unified. All the students in a class should be presented with the same material, although everyone learns at different speeds, this would make it more fair. If everyone in the class got the same concept to learn and do a project on people could work togeather. Me and my friend Generic_Name do this a lot when we have the same assignment for a class we will hang out and get our work done, its very helpful working with her or other people and getting different perspectives or ideas. Rather than every student picking a different topic and learning about something unordinary like frog eggs, which isnt a necessity to know in life. If projects are given by teachers and everyone gets the same task its more unified and kids can learn while working with eachother, team work is a important life skill everyone has to learn.

Being a unified class is as equally helpful with learning as being structured. At my school we use online resources such as google classroom which is structured assignments that teachers post, it also help students stay on task. Structure is connected to orginization, it is proven that lack of orginization can cause students to fall behind with school. Most kids are not organized, students lose supplies and stuff all the time like its a teenager thing. Teachers are unually more organized, which proves they should be responible for giving the summer projects. Without structure from teachers students will do whatever they want like pick the simplist topic to do a project on.

During the school year most schools have teacher-designed projects and teachers actually teach what students are required to learn. Teachers create plans for their everyday classes, based off the content the state tells them students need to be taught. So why would teachers not continue doing what they have all year and just give out summer teacher-designed projects?
