Some scholars say that they would rather learn from online school than getting up every morning for 8 hours a day with barley any sleep, but what if online classes from home is actually a bad thing? my reasons that students would not benefit from learning at home is because they wouldn't get as much work done, the deadlines for work would be shorter, and you wouldn't meet friends face to face.

Learning from home doesn't seem like a bad idea but within this new generation technology controls majority of the kids now, so the fact that they're always on their phones and game systems all day and during the school hours what makes you think that they would get any work done with online school, especially if it's just continuous reading or recordings talking? That's when school steps in with a helping hand because even though kids are on their phones the teachers always pressures the kids to do work, yet not in a forceful way but as in a ultimatum. For an example when learning from school you'll have competition, so when you see five kids turn in their papers you'll try to be like them to have your grade in the grade book first and to be one of the first kid to have the most free time on your phone but when your at home you don't have anything to motivate or pressure you in to turning your work because your're allowed to be on your phone or game system as long as you get the work done sooner or later yet if its too late then the consequences will hurt your grade as an online student which follows to my next reason the deadlines.

when you're learning from online your deadlines are different from the school systems and although from my perspective this writer doesn't know much about how online school works but from regular day to day school system she dose and what she can say is that regular school deadlines are kind of short but you can get extended time if you ask and extra credit work to help build up the grade if you were late or had gotten a grade you didn't like on that assignment yet some of your teachers may say you have until the end of the marking period to turn in work which is the best feeling ever for all students. My opinion on online school deadlines is that it may be longer than an regular school deadline but it may be more crucial due to how an automatic grading system could be, yet online students can ask for extra credit as well so there's always good news. An example would be that one day last year I had tons of work I was late on and it was almost the end of the marking period so I gathered all my missing papers that I was missing and asked my teacher could I still turn it in and she said yes and my D average grade went to a B+ later that week and as for my extra credit I had to go around the school with some other students to help with recycling which i had made new friends which transforms into my last reason; making friends.

the difference between online school and regular school is the making friends process. In my opinion making friends is the best part of having to go to school in real life because your meeting face to face with people who you can get to know, your're getting to know them better by spending quality time with them and realizing who's going to stay in your life for the rest of your life and even though you know they're not it's good to have them for the meantime, right.? But having friends from online could be a bad thing because you're only talking through a screen from group projects or from your social media apps and what's the point of friends like that when our new generation does that 24 hours a day knowing that you could have so much more fun outside than on your phone every single day. Majority of the online students that will become your friend would probably live far away and the ones who don't might not want to come outside and hangout due to the things they might have going on in their life. An example would be going out and having something to talk about as an online student, you guys would talk about the basic things like school work, the regular how have you been talk and personal questions but for a regular scholar you two would talk about the fights that happened that day, a crush that you have, the things that happened in the classrooms, the pep rallies that youve seen that year and etc. which in my opinion would spark up a good laughter.

those who consider to have online school would be consider lazy and foolish in my opinion because in the end its not about the school system it about your everyday life when you get older and how you're going to live it its not about taking the short way out.

As for my conclusion only collage students and those that have a busy schedule like famous people should be given the option to have online school yet only if they are responsible enough and those are my three reasons why online school would not be a good idea.
