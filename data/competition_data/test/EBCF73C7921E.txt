LEARN BY WAY ONLINE OR VIDEO CONFERENCE

INTRODUCTION AND BODY

one day a man entrepreneur decide of make a application for give more time everyone . this is a great idea but everbody don't thinks so . me i am two party for and containt.

Everybody want to be free for her occupation

I want give you my opinion in learn online video conference. i think that this practice is good but also not really good ,so i take two instance .

a student don't to go to school but he/she learn at home by way of online and conferencing i find it graet because he/she can do her preocupation like cook ,watch the tv clean house her . Even you can drive and learn this is really good appplication .

I find that do activity at homme is benefit. again you can hang oneyes children .

I don't so you pass more time that one hours. So you have more time at you > majority people wantt do this activity for have more time .Now i don't think this is a great idea bacause you don't really understant and if you ask for example "what do for ......" and they explain you always not understant you dont have learn somthing.

So what do you learn for the online video conferencing ?

Personnaly i think that this is a Bad and Great idea.

Bad because you nothing understany and Great beacuse you have more time time for yourself .

Parents like this proccesus because is great for their . they have time for take their activity , but for chil who dont work ,this is a obligation for him to go to school because chidrens are lazy and if parents let their children do this application or proccessus this is Bad .

I-

IV CONCLUSION

This is a great idea of create this processus but everbody don't gotta use this procesesuss .

and my opinion in the conclusion is that is not a good processus for children.

Is it for the parents who work and busy by her famally . I disagree idea of do online or video conference for a students .
