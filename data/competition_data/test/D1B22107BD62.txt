Luke Bomberher had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working a two part-time jobs in a grocwry store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

When Luke and Don got there they were so happy. That is when Luke relized that he wanted to serve there.

Lukealso wanted to help. He says that seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. That is one of the reasons why he wants to serve and help.

Helping out on Luke's aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slipperu ladder on his backside. Likes heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. He was safe.

Luke is now a Seagoing Cowboy snd is much more adventurous. It opened the eorld to him, and now Luke Bomberger is reslly happy.

These are some reasons from the story "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves, " and why he wanted to join the program.
