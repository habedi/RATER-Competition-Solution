Many people don't take after school activities and some do that is just the type of person and they desicion of that person or their parents. I don't take an after school activity because I feel like it would stress me out, and when I get stressed out I get angry extremely fast. My parents don't make me do because they think it is for the best to let me choose that desicion but some parents do make them because they feel it's for the best. So I disagree with this statement because some students may have busy a life, some may be having family issues happening at the certain moment, and others may not be interested in a certain activity.

One thing is some kids may have busy lives and they can't make the time for it. An example is if a kid has a after school job and they have to work on certain days. It means they would either need to get special permission from the school or would they have to take kids away from their job. Another example is if the kid has a lot of homework and they have a certain amount of time. They would have to stay up all night in order to finish the homework because of an after school activity.

Some of the students may be going through some family issues at that current moment. What about if a student's parents are going through a divorce. That student could have continuous panic attacks or having mood swings the would probably get in them trouble. Also what if one of the student's relatives are sick or got into an accident. The relative would probably want the student there a lot because it could be getting worse or they could be close to death, the student wouldn't have time to see them.

My last example is if the student is not interested in a certain extracurricular. They student may get signed up for a sport he doesn't like but is required to take. He probably wouldn't try his best because he doesn't find the sport interesting or just doesn't really care. Also if the student attempted to sign up for something but doesn't make it, so they sign him up something he doesn't like. If a student would attempted to sign up for track but doesn't make it he might get signed up for volleyball but he doesn't enjoy volleyball.

So in conclusion I don't think it is fair to force students and their peers to do after school activities and it should be students or his parents choice. If a kid doesn't want to take a extracurricular it is their right not to and if they do, they choose an extracurricular. I believe it is the students choice to choose, or the parents of that certain student and not the school. So I disagree with it because some students could have a busy life like having a job, they could have family issues like a divorce, and theirs may not be interested in a certain activity like football or baseball.
