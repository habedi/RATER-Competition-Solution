This year our principal has decided to make all students participate in one or more extracurricular activity. As an overall active student, I think this is a great idea. It could help with anxiety, help students make friends, and help people get around more. Its better for us to be apart of something and be well-known to your peers.

A lot of students suffer from Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, and so much more. Helping them get out into the world and show them that some people have the same problems, and that having disorders as such aren't bad. When our principal does this, hes showing us as students that we can all work together if we just try.

Doing activities such as help with the year book, or play in sports, could help students make friends. It lets the other peer know that you have the same interests, and that you have a better chance of getting along with that person. You can meet new people, and find out how easy it is to get along with people who share your interest.

In the real world, you have to make yourself known. To get a job, to make friends, and to make a living. You have to be able to interact and talk to people, and you have to know how to communicate with others. This organization can help with that. It can help with teamwork, communication, and so much more.

Yes, I strongly agree with our principals decision and this will be great for our school community. Its a great way to express interests and emotions with people that understand. I think this is a smarter way to make friends and get along other than forcing yourself to talk to someone in class, or randomly walking up to someone and saying hi awkwardly. These extracurricular activities are helping to make the school a better place.Â
