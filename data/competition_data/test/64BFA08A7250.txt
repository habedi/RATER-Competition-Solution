The logical explination for the face being on the moon is the metiors had to hit the planet Mars and they all had landed together to make a face like object in this planets crust to make it look like this. Well because in this acrticle it says in paragraph 3 it was a huge rocks formation.

Also another logical explination would be it was really hot one day and a big fire had started on a mountin where there was lots of dried out land and a big fire started and when the fire stated there was a big spot and the fire had reached it and then it was it the praticular shape of a face so it stood out onto the earths crust. It also says in paragraph 12 that it is a lava dome .

This big landmark could also be made by a big cannion or mountain that is in a direct shape of a face or just a bunch of trees could be gathered together to have a perfect form or shape of a face. In pargraph 12 it also talks about a plain which is a open area with alot of mountains.

Anways this all has an explinations other than aliens doing it. Also like there could have been a massive sand storm and the wind picked up really heavy and was throwing rocks and blew alot of sand and rocks and it could have created a face like object that you see when you look through a telascope at mars. Also say a huge rock formation in paragraph 3
