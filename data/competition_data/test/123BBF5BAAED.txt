Wouldn't it be amazing if all students had the opportunity to be enlightened with new experiences? Those new experiences will open up their minds to explore different activities. All students should participate in at least one extra-curricular activity such as participating in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council.

One extra-curricular activity students could be exposed to is participating in sports. Sports allow them to have fun in a challenging game. The competition makes them more excited about the game. Sports also give health benefits to students. They will be more athletic and eventually enhance their skills in that sport. Lastly, they will learn how to work as a team. Teamwork is a useful skill that they will need for the rest of their lives. Sports may be one of the most popular activities, but there are more options that students will have to participate in.

Some other extra curricular activities students could be exposed to are working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. Working on the yearbook will teach students computer and organization techniques. In addition, they will learn to collaborate ideas with their peers. Students will also learn how to be considerate of the opinions of others. Serving on the student council will give students the chance to have a leadership position. They will make important decisions and have a large impact on their school. They yearbook creators and student council members get to have interesting experiences that will last for a lifetime!

Although having extra-curricular activities offers so much for students, certain people share a different opinion about the topic. Some believe that the students won't have time for their personal lives. That might be true in some cases, but many activities are included in their every-day school schedule. In comparison to that belief, many think that none of the students' activities should be manditory. If we didn't have manditory activities, students wouldn't find their passions easily. Suprisingly, they also believe that there are better things students could be focusing on. Extra-curricular activities are not a waste of time; students get to have fun, interact with people, and learn at the same time! The knowledge obtained from these activitiess will be put forth to their dreams for the future.

To conclude, all students should participate in at least one extra-curricular activity such as participating in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. Students' minds are still growing, so they must engage in whatever they can in order to be prepared to walk on the correct path in life. That path will not be a struggle to navigate through if we expose them now.
