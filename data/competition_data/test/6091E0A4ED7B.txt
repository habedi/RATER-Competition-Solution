For many years scientist and mechanics have been trying to create a car that drives on its own. Over the years, they have come close to creating that car, and soon they'll have is made. I personally feel like it's a bad idea to create this car, even though there are some good points to it.

I get car sick, and I'm sure many people in this world get car sick too. I have found that when I drive, I don't get car sick, one reason it that I'm keeping my mind busy and focus on driving. With self driven cars I would not be driving, so I'll get car sick, I would rather walk to my destination, than get sick and dizzy because of driverless car. However, you're probably thinking "I don't car sick." So letting me move on. Everyday someones computer crashes, phones freeze, or their eletronic device's battery runs out. What does this have to do with the car? Well, I'm glad you asked. If this is a driverless car it is a known fact that it'll be electronic. So imagen you're driving in the high way when you're car manlfunctions and shuts down. If you can't get you're car under controll quick enough you'll crash right in to the person in front or beside you. Technology is known to fall apart and malfuntion all the time, so most likely this driverless car will cause more accidents.

This idea of a driverless car is not all bad. There are some good things about it too. For example, texting and driving will be less dangerous, drunk people will be able to drive home without worrying about crashing, or if there is a traffic jam, you don't have to worry, because the car will provide entertainment for you. It's the future now. Of course everyone wants to take things to the next level. I just don't think we're ready yet.

In conclusion. driverless cars are a bad idea because they'll cause more car crashes, make people lazier, cause many people to get car sick, including myself, and it'll do more bad than good. The car can help with many things as well . The future is bright, the next level of future things is driverless cars. But, for right now the future is doing just fine with drivers driving a car.
