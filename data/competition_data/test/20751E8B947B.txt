Dear TEACHER_NAME I heard about the new policy you are about to change. I strongly think that this is a bad idea. I think that this is a bad idea because everybody that wants to do sports but they're not going to be able to if they have C' s, ya maybe some players might have B' or A' s but some kids don't no matter how hard they try they wont get to play a sport. RELATIVE_NAME has problems in school but he's one of are best players and we need him on the football team if we are going to win.

I really think that we should keep this policy how it is because we will lose a lot of players on the team and might not be able to even play what ever game it is, if nobody is eligible. We will just have to for fit games and that would make are school look bad. I'm sure you wouldn't want that to happen right? Maybe instead of a (B) you could change it to a (D). I also think that if you were to change the policy the kids that want to play but cant will probably kid made fun of so more bullying would occur
