Dear principal,

I think both policies are a good idea. But i do find that one is better then the other because of many reasons and its not just because I'm a student I'm looking at it as many different point of views as if i was a parent, a teacher, and a student.

I honestly think that policy one is a good choice. I think it will keep kids from sneaking texts in school. I think this because if we get to use our phone during the free times we have which there is a few we would all use them then instead of texting in class because they know they can text without getting caught or paying a fee in the free times or lunch periods. The only problem you have to worry about is them starting drama through texting at school. I personally don't keep my phone in my pocket at school i keep it in my locker, and sometimes its on and sometimes its off.

I think if we went to policy two it would definitely keep us out of trouble and save us from distractions. But if we couldn't have our phone on school campus at all or not even in our backpacks then there would be issues with kids getting home, or parents aren't able to get a-hold of their kids because they don't have there phones with them after school, and they have to walk home. That could really start some problems/issues with the parents. But this is just my opinion.

personally think policy one is the better idea. I do believe it would keep the kids from sneaking around and trying to text in the class room. Yeah, there will be ups and downs with that policy one but there would be ups and downs with policy two too. I think it would be cool the have our phones out during free times too. But yet again I'm allowed to bring my phone to school, and i don't try to use it in class, so it wouldn't really matter to me i guess. Except trying to find my mom when she picks me up from school. but anyways this is just my opinion one the policies and how i see them as.
