The principals want every one to at least participate in one extra activity after school. the students have to pick one or they won't be able to do it and the principle would get made at you because you didn't show up at any activity. some activity are basketball, football, soccer , and tennis. students can work on sports and the yearbook, and you can also work on a student sere vestÂ council.

yes because students can get the best out of it and you would get serves hours every single day and you get your blood flowing if you did one of those activities. since students are in middle school they have the right to do any activities at there middle schools and the principle said they would have to do it every single or on the days they say after.

some middle schools don't have after school because of where they live or the school does not provided. the reason why i like after school is i get to participate in basketball games and help out with the yearbook and that is why i like talking about after school activities.

students should participate in all of the activities that the principle gives them. i like that students get the aportuite to go to an event that people have set up and that some kids don't get gift that students get at after school and get to born off energy at school or at your house if you like to participate in activities or play a sport or do a yearbook club with your friends or do those things at school.

people like to participate in things be cause the get out of your house or at schools, because at school your sitting on your but all day and night and your bones get tired.

the principle give us thing to do because some kids get on there nerves and they give the students a activity to do after school so they can be tired when they get home or from work. some people like to do after school because you can get exercise and watch some TV when you get home or homework can be an activity because you are writing some thing down on paper or typing on a computer at school or at home and that is why principles give you an active to do at home or after school. some schools don't get the types of things we do at our middle schools. people don't like the idea because it would get kids in trouble because they would hurt people or be inapropite. that is why some school around the united states don't have after school. the principle give you these things to do is to keep people from doing wrong or do there homework and help out with the yearbook committed and also be the aprotuite to play some basketball after school and participate in a march madness basketball tournament after school at most of the middle schools and you can make your own team for 7th grade and 8th grade. people like to do this after school because they can still play basketball and get the aprotutite to play basketball. some people after school really like to do the yearbook committed because they can take pictures of grate classes and gym classes and then send them to a photo committed and then they put the photos in a book and then they call it the year book.

some students can sign up for a position for a students council and it would be every single day after school.

some kids don't like to stay after because they have things going on at there houses. some people like to stay after school because they want to go to homework club or basketball club or tennis club or football club and video game club and the last one is rubies cube club and all of the those clubs are after school Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday. Friday are the days they have the clubs and if you don't come you won't get serves ours and you would be stop by the printable. there are so many things you can do after school like go to basket ball and football and homework club and walk around with your friends and get energy out of your body because you have been sitting all day. one reason why i like to stay after is to do homework and play basketball with some friends or pick up a game of basketball and if there are none i try to make one.

after school is really great because i get to do things like go see teachers if i have a homework assessment do the next day. after schools really great because students get to be away from there homes and don't have see them or get in trouble. so that is the story of me typing about after school works and the people that stay after are really nice people and after school has a lot of activities every single day except Tuesdays and Fridays are the only days that don't have late buses and also when you stay after school you can take a late bus home or walk or call your parents to come get you from school because all of the teachers have to go home to because so they can grade papers and get a good night rest for tomorrow or also the teacher would be very grumpy every day and that why i don't give a teacher hard time. there are so meany things after school and so i recamend staying after. that is why we need to extend the school day because we don't get a lot of time to do things like after school programs. if we had a extended school day we would get a lot of time to walk around the school and play basketball or help the pricipal with some things or be a helper cleaning up after people and cleaning people class rooms for serves hours on the days we have after school. the reason why we should a longer school day is because we can basketball games like the march madness and go to the rubies cube club and do homework and this is why we have after school so students can participate in things. the reason the the principle wants kids to participate in actives is because students go home and do not do there homework and teachers get made and that is why we have after school is so kids can get there homework done and also go see a teacher for help if they are after school when you stay after. some kids stay because so they don't have to go home and see there family and also they can get in trouble. the end
