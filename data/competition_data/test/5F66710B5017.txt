In this story about "Making Mona Lisa Smile" They talked about alot. In the first two paragraphs they talked about Face Expressions. Dr. Huag and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. They can caculate Emotions like a math homework. How can a computer recognize subtile facial movements we humans use to Express ourselves.

Then it gets into Facial Expressions that could be recognized. In this paragraph it said "you can probably tell how a friend is feeeling simply by the look on their face". Some people havr a natural mean look and some have no expression. Dr. Huag predicts that a calssroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused. He says the same technology can make computer amimated faces more expressive live video games, video surgery.

While looking in the mirror they give instrctions on how to make a smile. 1. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. 2. Then squint your eyes slightly, they will like like crows feet at the corner of your eye. 3. Hold all of that and then raise the outer parts of your cheeks up towards your eye. Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?

A Facial Feedback tells the person emotions. You could make a smilling face but are you really happy? Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but help produce them. People actually practice smiling and frowning on stage for them to create emotions. Whoevere would oof knew that making faces would reveal sos much about the science of emotions.

My conclusion of this that i never knew computers could caculate your expression. I could look and tell something is wrong with him or her by their facail expression. I could here their emotions through their voice not their face too much. You couldn't do this back then about 20-50 years ago because we didnt have thi much of technology. Now that we do its so much you can do with it.
