Us citizens have advantages of limiting car usage. We have advantages because in Freiburg "street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg." This phrase basically talks about how the people in that district don't have any car/driving privleges. Unlike in the United States the people in that district can only park their automobiles in a large garage at the edge of the development,where the person that buys the space spends $40,000, along with a home. I mean if i lived their i would be carless too. Also Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two said "when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."Not having a car makes the people so much happier because they dont have to spend thousands of dollars to park their car.

In the United States we are lucky to be able to drive because in Paris, after days of near -record pollution they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. The United States knows that we are polluting the air but they still give us the right ot drive what we pay for."On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."In the United States we are lucky to be able to drive our car anyday and everyday.
