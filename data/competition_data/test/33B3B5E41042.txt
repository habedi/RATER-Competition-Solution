Dear, Mr. Principle,

I do not think that our school should have mandatory service hours. I believe that doing a Public Service is an excellent thing to do, but it should be sincere. If a student does not want to do a public service but is forced to, then they probably won't do it very efficiently, or effectively. They may goof around, which can lead to property being damaged. Mandatory service hours increase the risk of property damage by forcing all kinds of students to participate. It may just be easier to give students the option of doing and recording service hours to help with college applications. With this method, it teaches students to be more self responsible for their futures. If they choose not to do community service, then it is their fault if it limits the amount of colleges that will accept them. Unfortunately, there are some students that are indifferent to the quality of their education. This way, everyone will be responsible for their own education and how they impact the world.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
