Stepping foot in venus would be a wrong idea without many research of how to do that. I think that the author used enough information to support the idea of Venus being a dangerous site. The author uses information to prove that Venus is a dangerous site by giving description,making observations,and doing research.

The author uses research information by proving that venus is a dangerous site .Text evidence that supports this is in the text it says,"Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."This shows that the author explains from studies that no one ever step foot into Venus ."Another piece of evidence that supports that the author uses research information to prove that Venus is in the text in paragraph 3 it says,"On the planet's surface ,temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit ,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."This shows that the author is trying to talk about how hot the planet venus is and it can hurt us humans to be there,because nowhere in Earth is as hot as Venus.

The author also uses description to prove that Venus is a dangerous planet. The author does that by talking about the weather ,and observations that they found. Text vidence that supports this is in the text it says,"Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes ,powerful earthquakes ,and frequent lightning strikes to probe seeking to land on it's surface."This shows that the author is proving the fact that the weather in Venus is more severe than any other planet in the solar system. Another piece of evidence that supports that is in the text it says,"Modern computers are enormously powerful ,flexible ,and quick ,but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."This shows that the author gave a point by finding out about observations of how powerful ,well-advanced technology can not survive in a place like Venus.

This is why I think the author used an abundant amount of information to prove that Venus is a dangerous planet that people can study ,because of it's geological study of weather,and it's conditions .This shows that the author proved his/her point that Venus is the most dangerous planet that people could explore .The author does this by giving information,making observations,and giving description to help the reader understand how dangerous this planet is .
