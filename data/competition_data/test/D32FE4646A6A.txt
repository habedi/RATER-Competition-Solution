Would you appreciate being forced to do an extracurricular activity even though you never intended on participating in one?

I think most people wouldn't appreciate that so thats why I disagree with what the principal says, because some students don't have time for after school activities or the student is shy and doesn't really want to be forced to talk to their peers .

While I understand that many people do like after school activities because you can meet new people and become more familiar with your peers.

This could be an okay solution for some people but some people are shy and don't want to be forced into activities.

This many lead to depression and loneliness which is why I disagree with the principal of the school.

There are many reasons why extracurricular activities shouldn't be forced upon a student, but we are only talking about two.

The first reason is that students just don't have time after school.

Many students out of school participate in sport activities or they help in their neighborhood.

These activities take up a lot of time on their own and most likelyÂ tire the students out.

Now imagine adding another activity they have to do before all their other requirements.

The students would be tired after their first activity, but then they would have to go to their other activities which would make them so exhausted after they might not get a good nights sleep.

Which is hurting the school because if the students don't get a good nights sleep they won't be able to pay attention in class and many of them would fail tests and even whole classes.

All this stuff is bad enough and we are only on reason one.

The second reason talks about people who are shy and can't talk to people well.

A lot of people around the world are very shy and antisocial and find it hard to connect with other people.

While many people believe if you make someone who is shy hang out with other people they will make friends or become better talking with their peers.

In some cases it might help the person but in many scenarios if you make a shy person hang out with others against their will they might get anxiety or feel more lonely watching their peers talking to each other while they are just watching.

All of this could lead to depression which would make them feel useless and they would most likely start failing in school.

Now that both the reasons are complete and there's a good understanding of why I disagreed with the principal.

What would you have done if you were a student at this school and you weren't very athletic and you weren't the best at extracurricular activities, but you were forced to participate in something you don't want to do?

I think many people would be angry and say that is goes against their rights. I believe that everyone should have a choice and that they shouldn't let some tell them what to do.

Everyone is different and shouldn't be told what to do, because many people like many different activities.

I believe many people would agree with me and say that they disagree with the principal and what they are saying.

the real question is do you agree or disagree.
