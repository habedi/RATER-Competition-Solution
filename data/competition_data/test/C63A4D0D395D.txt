Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Everyone is talking about you in school now.

They all think that you're going to force us all to do community service.

Personally, I think that it's a terrible idea.

Here's why...

Isn't community service supposed to be based on volunteer work?

It completely and utterly destroys the purpose of community service if you make the entire school do it.

Like other kids I know, we do not support all of the ideas of our community.

So why should be help?

Why should I want you help someone who is going to deny my gay and lesbian friends the right to marry?

Why?

Would you help a mass murderer throw away evidence just because he's your neighbor?

Also, what if someone gets hurt?

How is that going to look?

Here's an example of how someone could get hurt.

Let's say OTHER_NAME works at a homeless shelter.

And he wants some help to run it.

He calls you, and gets your approval to bring twenty-five into the shelter to work for one hour each.

I think that this is a terrible idea.

One, you're bringing little kids into a dirty and gross building that its more than likely filled to the brim with diseases.

And let's say that little OTHER_NAME gets attacked while he's there.

What do you think this would mean for the school?

News headline

: YOUNG BOY AT LOCAL SCHOOL ATTACKED ON COMMIUNITY SERVICE PROJECT.

What good would come out of this?

I think that if you want people to do community service, you should let them win prizes ever time they do community service.

Now some would say that it would be volunteering.

But when you think about it, how else are you going to get kids to work for their community?

I can assure you that this is the way to get children to work for their community.

To sum this all up, I think you should not make all of the children at this school work, and you should encourage them to work my offering prizes.

With love,
