Driverless cars will be a great innovation in the automobile insustry, because driverless cars will be safer, more convenient, and possibly more fuel efficient.

Driverless cars would make the world a lot safer, when dealing with automobiles. People die everyday in car accidents. With driverless cars, at first, of course, there will be complications regarding the sensing and accident prevention. After so long, with yearly upgrades and constant innovation, driverless cars' software should excel to the point of perfection, without any accident occurance. In paragraph 5, the test states, "Sensors are nothing new, of course. in the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own." This example shows that sensoring software ability is increasing, and as time goes by technologists learn more and more. Over time sensors will get better and better to the point where driverless cars are 100% safe.

Driverless cars are more convenient than cars with drivers. Cars with drivers require full attention from the driver. There are many cases, involving possibly injury, or even just fatigue, where a driver is forced into a position of either finding alternate transportation, or driving under dangerous circumstances. If a driver owns a driverless car, or has the accessability to a driverless "taxi", then whether fatigue, injured, or intoxicated, the driver, or now passenger, can safely be transported to their destination, without the result of an accident. Many people against the idea of driverless cars would claim that a driver must still be alert with a driverless car. This statement would be true, as of now, but if driverless cars are introduced now, within the next ten years, driverless cars will be so dominantly present, drivers would never have to touch the wheel. If every car on a street is computer controlled, the computer systems could recognize another attempting to leave a parking lot and simply leave the car space to do so. Through more innovations, obstacles like those stated in paragraph 7, would be easily manuvered.

Driverless cars are more fuel efficient than cars with drivers. Many times today, people drive their cars with a "heavy foot." Acceleration uses gas in a car that could be saved with coasting. If are car is ran by a computer, acceleration and coasting time would be monitored, and done the most efficiently possible. In paragraph 1, the text states, "The cars [Google cofounder Sergey Brin] forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis..." This example shows that, driverless taxis and cars are far more fuel efficient. If a driverless car owner uses only half the fuel of a driver required car owner, then the driverless car owner is saving a tremendously more amount of money on fuel.

Driverless cars will be a great innovation in the automobile insustry, because driverless cars will be safer, more convenient, and possibly more fuel efficient.
