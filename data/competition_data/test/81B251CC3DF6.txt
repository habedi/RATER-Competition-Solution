Making this use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because some students like to keep their emotions to thereselves. Another reason is some students have more of a serious face so you can't tell their emotions. Last reason is people have mixed emotions.

Some people like to keep their emotions to their selves because they dont want people to know whats going on. An example from the article is "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation." This means that some human don't like to communcate especially with their emotions.

Some students have more of a serious face, so you cant tell whether their happy or sad. An example from the passage is "For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." This means that you can tell when a person is happy or sad, but some people can have serious face, but can really be happy in the inside.

Some people have mixed emotions. which means like mood swings etc. An example from the passage is "By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions." This means that the person can either be sad, happy, serious, or mad.

Therefore the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of stuudents in a classroom is not valuable because some students want to keep their emotions to their selves.
