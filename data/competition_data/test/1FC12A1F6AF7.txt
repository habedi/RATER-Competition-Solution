There are so many reason why using a car can destroy our community,personally I think using your car less would be a good idea. There are some advantages of limiting car usage,as you know the fume inside the car could give you a lot of problem with heart your lungs when you breathing air. By limiting our car usage we could have a chance of protecting the new generation from the polluted gas that comes out of the cars. In some country  many people are happy even they are not using cars to go anywhere example In Germany life goes on without the usage of cars.

Alright look I get that cars are a good transportation device because when your have a long way to go It could be very hard to there and you want to use a car that is acceptable,but like If you have to go somewhere that is 1 mile do you really need a car to get there. You don't have to have a car to have a happy life just look at this little paragraph i have search up."As a result,70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move here."When i had a car I was always tense."I'm much happier this way,".

When we use cars a lot it cause us to buy a lot of gas that cost a lot of money. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many teens and adults died from car accidents it might because they driving to fastor someting else. All that I am trying to say is that cars can be good for the community or it could bad for the community. That is all and why I think it a good thing to have the advantages of limiting car usage.
