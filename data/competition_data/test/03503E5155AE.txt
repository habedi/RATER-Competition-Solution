I had classes at home and i did just fine. When it comes to online classes it is not benificial , the only thing thats wrong with classes online is that its different because you not in front of the teacher in a classroom with student and its very easy to get distracted.

Sitting in a classroom with student & sitting in your bedroom alone is two different learning enviorments. A student might not be able to learn what there post to be learning in classroom then in their own room at home. In a classroom you have learning tools around the wall hat help you. Theres other students in a classroom so you feel like youÃÂ¨re in an learning enviorment. The teacher can help you face to face instead of going threw a screen to help. When your at school you have to go by the school rules and leastin to the adult in school. When your at home you dont have to wake up early , you can wake up anytime you want.

A student can easily get distracted at home doing classes online. Famly member can be loud during your online class. You can easliy have access to anything to be honest. When your at home you can determine how long your breakes are, you can go make yourself food when ever you want to with out having to wait when lunch time is at a normal school. When your at home , its alot easier to cheat because you cant get introuble for it.
