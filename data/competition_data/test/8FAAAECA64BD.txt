I do not agree with this idea. It will not benefit all the students. This plan could cause students to feel more stressed out. Some students may be busy and wouldn't be able to attend practices, meetings, and other types of gatherings for these activities. Students also may not have a way to these activities and this could lead to these students missing out on important information.

This idea may lead to stress because students could feel obligated to excel in the activity they're participating in. Extracurricular activities also add on to the amount of school work and homework students have. This could cause students to panic and they may rush through their work and this could cause them to do poorly on assignments. Stress levels could increase for students and it could cause them to perform poorly in school. Students may also stress about information they have missed about these activities if they missed a meeting, a practice, or any other types of gatherings for the activity.

This leads us to our next topic. Students may have important events to attend the same day as a meeting or practice. This could cause students to miss important information about upcoming events for that activity. Students then would have to catch up on missed information along with their school work. Depending on the activity, this could lead to major problems.

Students may not have a way of transportation to these activities. This could lead to many missed meetings, practices, and any other types of gatherings for the activity they're participating in. If a student were to participate in a sport and they didn't have a way of transportation to the practices then the student would be kicked off the team and they would have to find a new activity, this may be difficult to do. This applies for other non sportÂ related activities as well. Missing these meetings could also lead to confusion and spending time figuring out what a student missed and informing them about the situation.

Extracurricular activities stress out and put pressure on some students. This may lead to doing poorly in school. Some students may miss out on important information. Making all the students participate in an extracurricular activities isn't the best choice. Students should be allowed to choose if they want to participate in these activities.
