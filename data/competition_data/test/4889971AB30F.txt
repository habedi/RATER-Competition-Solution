School summer projects should always be designed by teachers because they know what is best for students to work on, and what they need for later years in high school. Unlike teacher-designed, student-designed instead does not alway comes with appropriate content for the project, but also could break school policies. Teachers could provide students enough informations about their project, and instructions for students to understand as they follow through it.

Student-designed summer projects on the other hand, which is not always school supported, and a lot of people would tend to think it is a lot harder;however, it depends on what subject of the project they are working on, and those could be any topic such as Math, English, Science, and Social Study. One were to be about Astronomy, where students would have to reinvent what was already existed and present it to the class;if it were to be student-designed, they could be working on reinventing weapons, alcohols, and drugs, which would be against the school policies. During the summer, some students would want all their full free time, so they would get lazy, decided to be careless, or forget about their student-designed project and get a bad result on it.

As for teacher-designed project, the easier, the better, where it will always be school appropriate, would help students into understanding their project, learning more from it, and have experienced from it. Teacher-designed would help students gather their materials into what they are aiming to do in their future.
