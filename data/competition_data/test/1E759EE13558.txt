Dear principle,

I think that Policy one is better because some times students might need to call there parents in case of and emergency. Also its a good idea as long as the students follow the rules and don't get into trouble. And also its a good idea because then there will be no distractions during class. Also if students use there phones during lunch they could see what's happening with there friends from different schools instead of the middle of class. But also this might me a bad idea as well because what if there is an emergency and the parent decides to call and there child is turned off.

This policy has good things and bad things about it but its still a better plan then not taking phones to school. Also about it is if the student doesn't obey these rules teachers can take them a way until the end of the day of school. But if that happens allot some precautions might be to take the phones at the beginning of the period and then get them back and the end of class.

And the well behaved students get to keep their phones for as long as they don't text.

Also the second policy works because then there will be no more distractions while learning and also students can get concentrated on the assignment. But the down side would be and emergency some students might need to tell there parents something that is important and might need them right away to come pick them up and such.

But that is on what i just think and I have given my reasons on the best one should be best.

sincerely'

student
