Phones and Driving

Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. Drivers should not use cell phones while driving, only because it could cause a server wreck and/or serious injuries. Driving while using a cell phone could also cause you to swerve and get pulled over and receive a ticket. Using a cellular device while driving is very dangerous and shouldn't be permitted.

When driving on the road, you should be able to pay attention and get to where you're going safely. By using your phone while operating a vehicle could cause a huge wreck and maybe your life and, also putting somebody else's life in danger. Say for instance, your trying to take a call while driving and you end up running a red light while traffic is coming from the other way, now there's a wreck with you plus three other cars. So, tell me was that call more important than your life? You should always be cautious of the road while driving because not only is it important for your life but also everyone else that's on that road with you.

Driving while on your phone could also result in getting pulled over and paying a very expensive ticket. Texting while driving or trying to use a cell phone period is against the law and you will have to pay a fine. Having to pay tickets could be real, stressful on you especially if you have other bills to pay but all of that could be prevented by not being on your phone while driving. Think twice about breaking the law because you might not get caught the first time but when you do you will have to pay the consequences.

In conclusion, it is very dangerous to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. In some cases, say if it's an emergency and you had to take the call or text your child or that person, but you had to be somewhere then there's solutions to solve that problem. But you should always be careful while driving because we want everybody to make it safe to where they need to be. Think of others and yourself too and I guarantee it will be worth it.
