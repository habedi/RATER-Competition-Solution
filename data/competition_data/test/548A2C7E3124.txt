Dear TEACHER_NAME,

TEACHER_NAME, I think you should consider policy one for lots of different reasons.

Students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and free times. Sometimes we have to call home and being able to have our phones out is a privilege that would help us and if we have our phone out in class that privilege can be taken. Sometimes I has those days where I leave something at home and it would be nice if i have times during the day when I can home. You have some kids that may not follow the class part and that's where where you got to be stricter in the classroom but it would help with teaching responsibility. Not to have our phones at all is just torture we sometimes have to let our parents know things and we cant do that's my opinion with this matter as long as it doesn't begin to interfere with education we should at least be able to have them after school.

Thank you TEACHER_NAME

for taking the time to read my letter. I hope you will consider policy one.
