Many students participate in activities outside of school, youth groups, sports teams, clubs and lots more. Some schools that are fortunate to have enough funding for school activities, like clubs or sports teams, usually provide it for their students. Many times the students are provided these programs free of charge. Lots of students take the clubs and teams for granted, and dont realize how lucky they are to have so many activities for them to access. Schools provide all sorts of different clubs for all sorts of interest groups. Sometimes you can even form your own club. School-funded activities are usually very inclusive and invite and encourage everyone who is interested to come and try it out. I believe that it would be beneficial for every student to participate in an extracurricular because they help form a sense of belonging, and when students interact with others that share some of the same interests, they are more likely to form bonds and strengthen their social skills. In addition, they are a good use of time and can help kids stay out of trouble.

When kids go straight home from school, many times they find that they have completed their homework and are bored with nothing to do. They might go sit on their couch eat food and watch television. Or they might make an unsafe decision about what to do,and end up doing something unlawful or harmful to themselves, such as smoking drugs or vandalizing public property. Extracurricular activities provide tons of clubs or teams that include lots of physical activity, like running, and playing a sport or game. Even if students are just walking, that's still a lot healthier than sitting on a couch, snacking on chips. Studies have proven that when kids who are in an extracurricular activity are at less risk of incorporating themselves with gangs. School activities are very helpful towards students who have lots of free time. They are beneficial for students health and make sure kids stay out of trouble by taking up extra time.

Some students have a hard time finding a group of friends, and might not have the courage to make themselves vulnerable to people. School-provided activities invite students to go to clubs that focus on a common interest, like math, science, art, soccer, theater, film, or video games, and many more depending on the school. If students choose to attend club they can find friends based on common interests. They might meet someone and realize that they have a class with them. When students consistently attend a club they will get to know their peers and teacher or teachers there, which will create a friendly environment. Therefore forms a sense on belonging for the students there. Some clubs work on a group activity such as a film, play, or piece of artwork(etc.). Working together as a team can lead to feelings of accomplishment and pride. Students should be required to attend at least one extracurricular activity because they are more likely to make friends, and form a sense of belonging in that club, which is very healthy for teens especially.

When students attend an activity, they have a chance to exercise their social skills, by communicating with others, which can help them become more successful with jobs, meetings, group work, and more. Students today spend lots of time on their phones, computers or other electronic devices. they communicate through snap chat, text, face time or calls. But many kids lack the social skills needed in as group environment. Extracurricular activities encourage students to talk and communicate with their peers in a group environment. Communication is very important for future jobs, meetings, and auditions. Being able to communicate and work in a team is a big trait that companies look for when they hire people. So building communication skills will benefit students in the long term and help them become successful individuals.

I agree that every student should be required to take part in at least one extracurricular activity because more students would be using their time wisely and staying out of trouble, the clubs would build a sense of belonging for students, and help students build communication skills that will help them all throughout their lives.

students will feel a welcoming environment in the club that they choose and will be happier knowing that they have made a few friends. Students will build success- bound skills of communication during clubs that will help them in high school and college. Extracurricular activities will take up uneccessery free time that students will spend doing productive activities. Students should be required to take a school funded activity because it will be emotionally, socially, and physically beneficial for them, and also because it's fun!
