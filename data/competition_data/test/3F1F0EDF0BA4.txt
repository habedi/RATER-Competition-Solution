The Seagoing Cowboys program is a once-in-a-lifetime trip that will change your life, just like it did mine. It was a spontaneous change of my life! I had a great time knowing that all the work I was doing was saving lives and helping others, and it made me look at things at a whole different perspective. I still learned more about livestock, even though I am a small-town farm-boy. I learned that life isn't perfect for everyone, and that I was taking my living conditions for granted. These things have made me a better person.

It moved me to see all of these people living in ruins. Tatthered clothing, rubble everywhere, mass graves, dead/injured livestock, and people were starving to death. The Seagoing Cowboys got over to Europe (and Asia) and reversed a lot of this. It came to my attention that we, Americans, are taking our lives for granted. This was a relatively easy realization to make, as things are in ruins.

I am more sensitive to problems people have and now know that I'm an animal-person. I now look at things through a more "maybe it's worse" perspective. This has made me a better friend, better man, and more well-liked. I have made no regrets since my return. I think that once you see someone living in these conditions, you reach out to everyone a little more.

If I could, I would do it again! If you try this, you will leave knowing you made a difference. The people who save lives doing this are heroic. They were brave enough to go to Europe/Asia and make a difference. I highly recommend you to take part in this program. Wars don't happen very often, after all!
