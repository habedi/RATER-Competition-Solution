Dear principal, i believe that not letting students participate in sports if they do not have at least a B average is wrong. when i was in volleyball my 7th grade year it was the last game and i was failing science i was very disappointed to hear that i could participate because of my grades. Students look forward to playing in sports and participating , some students do not have the best grades but they succeed in sports. Sports are where you can be your self and do something your good at and you love doing it.

Students have trouble focusing and paying attention because there not doing something there good at , some students may do really good in some subjects but then really bad in another. I don't think that students should be punished because they don't understand how to do something which is making them fail.

Parents want to see there kid succeed and be able to say " my kid is on the football or volleyball team." I don't have the best grades in the world but who does , that shouldn't be a reason for students not enjoying what they love to do and are good at it. punishing students based on there knowledge is wrong and unfair.

So i think you should rethink your idea and think to yourself what if i was one of the students that couldn't participate in the volleyball, football, or basketball game .
