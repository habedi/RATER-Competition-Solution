The idea of a car-free life has become more appealing around the world. In the United States, South America and across Europe, they have developed new ways of transportation that seem to be more beneficial. In these souces they explain the many advantages of limiting car usage such as its better for the environment and people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and cheaper.

There are many benefits to limiting car usage and the first is it improves the environment. In Source 1, it says that reducing car usage would be, "A huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes". Passengers in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and 50 percent in the United States. "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change," said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. In that change recently,there has been many efforts to promote "car reduced" communities. In Source 2, Paris shows that they have made improvements in banning driving on certain days of the week due to smog. That smog cleared enough for the people to drive on days they were allowed to.

The second benefit to limiting car usage would be that people find more alternative ways of transportation easier and they are happier. "When i had a car iwas always tense. Im much happier this way," said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Many people expressed that other ways of transportation like biking or walking are much easier. In Source 3, it explains that Colombia has car-free days where they skate, bike, hike, or take buses instead. "Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.

In Source 4, it says that because of other ways of transportation are easier and cheaper, "Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year." It goes on to explain that "Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway." As more people become jobless, they find that taking buses or walking is much easier. That could be an advantage because Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out a plan where cities in which "pedstrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."

In conclusion, there are many ways in limiting car usage can be benefical such as with the enviroment, to the people, and it can change in the way this world operates. Living a car-free life would soon be very desirable in this world soon.
