Students with a grade C average should be able to participate in sports or other activities because we want to have more people participating in the activities and sports. In my opinion, a grade C average students should be able to participate not only because there are more students who have a grade C average, but the school should still give them chances to show what they can do in certain activities and sports because they might not be good at certain things, but turn out to fantastic at other things such as sports.

Our school sports or activities should be active and actually have enough students to do something. There are more grade C average students than grade B average students, therefore if grade C average students are not allowed to participate, which will decrease the amount of people participating in sports or other activities and that will lead to sports and activities to be less active. Also, some sports cannot be played unless you have fair amount of people, and if you exclude grade C average students from participating, some sports may not be able to play.

Also, if the principal changes the school policy that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average, the students and their parents might not agree with the result and it could cause troubles all around the campus. Also, I don't think its fair to just nullify the chances for students with a grade C average to participate in various activities or sports in school.

Finally, if the students are forced to have at least a grade B average to participate in activities and sports, the students will feel burdened and pressured to do well in school, so they can do things that they like to do such as soccer, football, or any other activities. Therefore, it would be unfair to stop the students from doing activities and sports just because they can't maintain a grade B average.

Therefore, the school policy should not be and allow students with a grade C average to participate in school activities and sports, so the community can be more active and fair to others. Also, more students will be able to show what they can do through participating in sports or activities. Therefore, the school policy should not be changed, so only a grade B average students can participate.
