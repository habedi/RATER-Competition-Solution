Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Since you were deciding if all student should do community service. Well I think you are right because student should tutor elementary students or help clean litter. For example if an elementary school need tutor students either in the middle school or high school student should volunteer but the student don't want to help. Also what if you need more people to help clean the school because the custodian are in there day off but you don't know who can help you but some volunteer like student but they don't want to help. What if you begged the administration if the school can volunteer on helping on anything if possible. Then the school have something they can help on but student don't want to volunteer. So TEACHER_NAME please put that requirement on the student that they need to do community service thank you for reading this letter and I hope you do the right decision.

Sincerely,

Student STUDENT_NAME
