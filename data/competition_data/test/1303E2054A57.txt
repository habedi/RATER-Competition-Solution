It identifirs the exprestions of ever feeling that was show on our face. The facial expressions for each emotion are all universal buy the different individuals often show varying degrees of expression that are not like a siling as broadway. (Nick D'Alto)

The Mona Lisa is a painting that dosent show much of an exprestion within her smile, but we can somewhat make out that she is somehow is smiling but with another expretion with it. Fpr according to the computer softwar, the Mona Lisa is mostly happy within the picture but also has other fellings like disgusted, fearful and angry. What most people don't understand is that the software has identified that there are more to what meets the eye of an expretion in life. After having many sciencetist look into this, many have found that by making a smile has to create some kind of an exprestion that we can identifie without technology itself. not all emostion can be identified but at least there is a way to show them through actions.

What I say is that the technology that we us today is not always what we need in life to find out about a simple smile where we can just feel and see it with our own eyes. Its just basic reactions from an expretion that we naturally know what they mean. So i say that we do not need any type of technology for experections.
