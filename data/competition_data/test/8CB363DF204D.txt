When school is finally out and summer has begun students can finally unwind and relax, but when teachers give assignments over the summer it's hard for students to be encouraged to do it. So does allowing the students pick their assignments help? The idea that summer projects should be student-designed is valid because it allows students to learn while still enjoying the summer.

Furthermore, by giving students the option to choose their own summer projects they will be more encouraged to do the work. As it will be something they have interestÂ in and would be excited to learn about. This option opens their horizons to many different ideas that can be explored; As for if the teacher told them what to do their options and/or minds would be limited. Students want to have fun over the summer and being given the option to chose their project allows that bit of freedom they wanted from school.

When given the option students would enjoy a project more if they were allowed to pick their subjects. Won't be bored and stuck with an idea that causes them to lose interest in doing the project all together. Allowing students to pick their subjects allows them to still have fun during the summer break. Even so they could incorporate their project into their summer fun giving the project creativity.

As a teacher you shouldnt give a student so much work over the summer that they dried on doing it as it should be something simple or none at all. When the school year is finally over kids don't want to have to worry about more work that needs to be done. They need a break to replenish there brains and come back to the new year strong.

As a result, student-designed projects are the best choice for students as it will encourage them to want to do it and allow them to enjoy doing it too. Expanding their minds and learning skills while still having that fun laid back summer they wanted. This is a great option and should definitely be given to students.
