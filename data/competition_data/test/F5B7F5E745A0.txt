School is a lifelong proccess. Every student everyday should be able to go to school and learn something new. Students have to improve their independent credibility in order to succeed in life so they must keep learning, even on break for example, summer. Every school year, there are breaks such as winter, spring, and summer break implemented into the year which allow students to relax. While on break, some schools require students to complete summer projects in order to keep them learning while some does not. With the school that does, students sometimes are allowed to design their own project while other times, the teacher have full authority. I feel like summer projects should be student-designed because then the students would have more control over what they want to do, it will promote self-leadership, and it will create a happy student and a healthy environment.

Students want control, they want to have the ability to choose what they do. If they have control, then the chances for them to complete the project is higher instead if it is teacher designed, it will probably get done last minute. Having the project student-designed also will relieve the pressure students have because then they do not have to worry about going off topic because they would be interested in what they do and stay on topic. Another reason why summer projects should be student controlled is because students will be more interest and will create positive impacts contributed to the project since the students will not get bored because it is their self-chosen project. Following a self-chosen project, it will allow a high, successful completion rate. With the students in control of their own summer projects, they would most likely promote leadership into themselves and the willingness to work.

Another reason why summer projects should be student designed is because it will give the students a chance to take leadership for once. While in school, students must listen to teachers, whether its homework, classwork, or projects. Having summer break, no teachers are around students and if students choose what they do, then it will promote self-confidence and leadership as it will help them in the future. It is very important to develope leadership in anything anyone does because it will make them more responsible for what they do and have integrity towards life. Also, having the project student-designed, it will encourage them to learn, either by themselves or with friends. Leanring by themselves creates a independent hard worker because at the end of the day, the only person someone can rely on is themselves. If students decide what to do, they might even choose to work in a team, which is another important process in life because somewhere along their life, they need to be dependent on a team and having a leader, things will take a right turn. With success being in play, it will create a happy, friendly student.

Sometimes teacher-designed projects are not really a bad thing because some students are not as hard workers and might not complete the project. It allows teacher authority to come in play because some students will not take authority themselves. Another reason why somtimes projects should be teahcer-designed is because sometimes, student might go off topic on what they chose causing them to get a unwanted score; so, having teacher projects, it will constantly be in their mind that this is a project my teacher assigned so they must stay on topic, whether the project turns out good or bad. Finally a project student-designed will have a fantastic result, the result being a healty, strong, happy student. A happy student doing what they want, chosing how they want the summer project to be will create them a healthy mindset. It will make them feel like they are not being forced to do anything and that they are doing it out of their own will. It is also important to let the students decide because someone cannot always make the decision for the students, they must move forward.

In conclusion, schools requiring students to complete summer projects are not a bad thing, but only under acceptable conditions for example, letting the student decide how they want to do their project. Overall it is summer break and there are no teachers around. The students should feel relieved and actually want to do what they do and have meaning in it but they must be in control. Leadership is an important role in life that everyone should develop in life in order to succeed and it must start at a young age, being able to make the right decisions and being responsible for it. A student-designed project, not only give them a chance to develope the leadership they need, it will also create a healthy mindset, acknowleging what they want to learn and implementing them into a school project and to share with peers. At the end, students are students and they will do what they desire, with a healthy mind, them having control and choosing what to do will result in a remarkable end product.
