Passenger cars are a standard method of transportation. Although, it is not the most affordable; nor is it easy to maintain. This method carries numerous disadvantages. Consequently, if citizens limit their car usage, it would be very advantageous.

Using an automobile for transportion is unethical for middle-class families. This is evident because Source 1 confirms that near French and Swiss borders, "...a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home." Obviously many families cannot afford to do that because more than half of Vauban's families, (Vauban is a suburb in Germany),  do not own a car and more than half had no choice but to sell theirs to move to Vauban in the first place (Source 1). Even the number of drivers in America has decreased because, during the recession, "cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars..." (Source 4). Sociologists also believe within the next few years, the number of car-owners will decrease because "...the Internet...allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends." So as the result of less car ownership, people who stopped using cars because of the recession will find less reason to resume the habit (Source 4). Clearly, limiting automobile use has positive effects because not only the middle-class, but the American population, can't afford cars.

Life without a car, environment-wise, is extremely beneficial. It is proven that automobiles are "...a huge impediment to current efforts to...reduce greenhouse gas emissions..." (Source 1). 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe is the result of the use of passenger cars. That percentage is up to 50% in the United States (Source 1). Because those numbers are so high, several advancements are being made to cause the percent to decrease. One example of this is, the Environmental Protection Agency's attempt to "promote "car reduced" communities...", to protect the nation's and the world's environment (Source 1). There is an environmental dilemma in Paris especially. The city has "near-record pollution..." and because they recognize the cause as being cars, they have enforced "...a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." (Source 2). This ban and other efforts to preserve the environment is advantageous because it is not just an individual's home but the entire population's. Limiting car usage is a small step to making choices that will benefit citizens in the long run.

Having a limit on car use is advantageous. This is made obvious for financial reasons and environment conservation purposes. It is expensive and taxing  to use a car and the environment is better off without automobiles. Cars are not a necessity.
