Dear Mrs. Principal,

I think that we should do a position on whether all of the students doing community service. Some friends of my do not want to do community service ,but some of my friends do want do community service .For example, if we all do the community service without you telling the students if they would like to do it, a lot if them are going to be upset and angry. If you ask them if they would like do the community service then that would be a different thing. You wouldn't have angry students ,and angry parents too. For example , if you do that action without telling the students then they would get angry ,and upset making their parents as will. So that why we should do a position first whether then telling all of the students that all of them are going to do community service whether the like or not. You would have a lot of students happy then sad or upset with you. So please think about doing the position first.
