Cellphones And Driving

In our modern day Society, cell phones are everywhere. We use them in all aspects of our lives. From school to work, or simply ordering a pizza. Although they are a great technological advancement, if not used properly they can become a distraction and have deadly consequences. We are about to discuss some of the reasons why cell phones and driving should not be used together.

Some people question... Why does my phone have GPS navigation yet I shouldn't use it while driving? And it is simple. When your eyes leave the road, even for a second, it becomes careless and dangerous. Most cars are now equipped with Bluetooth navigation. So anything you need while driving is at your fingertips. If need be, plan ahead and adjust your phone settings before pulling off.

A lot of younger people are losing their lives due to texting while driving. This too, can wait. If you need to send or respond to a text message then pull over. It's very, very dangerous to try to send a text, or read one, while driving. Not only that, but it is also against the law.

It is understandable that some point in time while driving, everyone will get an "important" phone call that can't wait. In this case, hopefully, you have already installed a hands-free device. If not, please pull over to take the call. It could mean life or death and no call, to me, is that important. Investing in Bluetooth or other hands-free devices will completely be worth it.

All in all, any type of distracted driving can be fatal. It is always best to avoid distractions such as, eating, music, texting, makeup, Etc all together. If you just can't avoid your phone while driving, turn it off completely. You can always return calls and texts later and besides no one wants to get pulled over and get a ticket for something so easily avoided.
