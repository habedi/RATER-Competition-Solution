Lately, there has been a debate on whether or not students should be required to participate in community service. I believe that students should be required to participate in community service. Community service is something important that students should do to help improve their character.

Community service is important because it helps build character. For example, when a student with low self esteem participates in community service by helping others in need, it helps that student build confidence. Also, if students get in trouble a lot, they can be punished by cleaning up garbage around parks and freeways. This task doesn't seem very fun, so the student will learn from their mistake.

I will admit that community service does take up a lot of time, work, and effort. Some students might not have the time to do it. Other students might be handicapped and not have the physical ability to participate in community service. It takes a lot of work to put down the video games or the remote and get off the couch to go and participate in community service.

However, community service doesn't have a set schedule. You can do community service any time you want and as your schedule provides it. For example, if you have to do community service three hours a week, instead of doing all three hours in one day, you can do an hour a day, three days a week. Also, if you are handicapped, you can always do community service by tutoring younger kids and starting programs to get other students involved. To add on, if your feeling lazy and don't feel like participating in community service, then just think about how your about to help improve your community to help get you ready for it.

In conclusion, I believe students should be required to participate in community service. It helps build character and your improving your community and the place you live.
