Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that kids should do community service because they can interact with more people, help the community and feel good afterwards. Community service is not wasting your time when you could be home playing video games. Its a time where u give up your time to help some one or something in need. I feel that community service would improve some kids self confidence. When most people do it they where forced by the school or they where with their friends and they didn't want to be left out. Well that's not how that should be we should take the responsibility to get up and do it. When i do service i think of everyone I've helped and lives I've saved, just by picking up some garbage or re building a house that was devastate by a hurricane.

Community service sounds like a punishment but its not its a reward. You receive an amazing feeling when you have helped some one. Its not just doing something in your spare time, its giving back to the earth. If we keep living in a world where we litter on beaches and streets we wont have many healthy animals and we cant grow vegetables in our back yards because we are too lazy to pick out the weeds. Soon the earth will die not now but it will if we don't change. If everybody did a little community service the world will be healthy and wont die. the point I'm trying to get across is that community service is helpful its not a waste of time and shouldn't be forced. But sooner or later if we don't start doing something about the trash community service will have to be forced, to save our planet.

sincerely,
