Dear Principal

I think that you should consider changing the average grade for a student to be able to play sports because most students in this school have a grade c average not b. Another reason why I think you should consider changing the average grade for a student to be able to play sports is because a lot of people would like to play the sport they like to play and be able to enjoy that time of their day. Another reason why I think this is because sports are a good way for kids to eczersize and when kids don't get the eczersize they need they will become unhealthy. Another reason why I think this is because when you have a team sport you need enough people to play in the team sport. For example for baseball you need atleast nine people on the field an if their are only eight the students that want to play that sport will not be able to so that is like a punishment to the people with a grade b average.
