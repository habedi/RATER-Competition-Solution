Some schools require students to complete summer projects, so the students continue to learn during their break. Critics might say that these summer projects should be designed by students because they understand what the students will be doing during summer break. These summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers know what the students will be learning after their summer break is over, teachers have more knowledge than students, and students will make the project as easy as possible.

Teachers should be designing these summer projects because they know what the students will be learning after summer break. This will be more beneficial for the students because the teacher can design the project that mainly focuses on material that will be crucial for the students when summer break ends. For example, if a student needs to know the fundamentals of Algebra 1, the teacher can add Algebra 1 basics onto the project that way after the break, the students know the material and the teacher will not have to spend a lot of class time reviewing. This not only helps the students, but also helps the teachers too since they can spend more time on new material rather than reviewing old material. The teacher could also include problems from next years course to give the students a little taste of what is to come.

The next reason as to why the summer projects should be designed by teachers is because the teachers have more knowledge than the students. The teachers having more knowledge about their subject and life in general is super helpful for the students when it comes to designing the project. If a student were to design the project it could possibly be a huge mess compared to if a teacher designed it because the teacher has done many projects before they became a teacher. This is very important because the teacher knows what kinds of projects are successful and which ones are a complete mess. The teacher can design it so it is easy to read and easy to do for the student.

Lastly, it would be better for a teacher to design the project because the students would try to make it as easy as possible. Since students want to have as little work as possible during their break, they will try to make the project very easy to do; however, if a teacher were to make the project they would make sure that it is not too easy, but also not too hard for the student. This is important because if it was too easy the student would not learn much over the break. For example, a student who got a student-designed project that was super easy might struggle when they come back from break because they did not learn anything since it was too easy. However, a student that got a teacher-designed project that was a bit challenging would have a much easier time when they come back from break compared to the one that got the easy student-designed project.

In conclusion, a teacher-designed project is more beneficial than a student designed project because teachers know what the students will be learning after their summer break ends, teachers have more knowledge than students, and students will try to make the project as easy as possible.
