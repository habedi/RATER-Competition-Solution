The value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions is an outstanding idea . The new software , the Facial Action Coding System , can help you understand everyone's emotions around us. This new software , has been develped to detect the feelings of others without them announcing their emotions .

In Mona Lisa's picture she looks happy and angry . The text states , "She's 83 percent happy , 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful , and 2 percent angry" . With the computer software you can use video imagery to recognize facial movements . The software can identify mixed emotions and and any neutral expressions . For example , most humans wear their emotions on their sleeves , but most humans can't describe each facial trait . The facial expressions on each emotions aren't always very universal , individuals often express their emotions in different degrees . Dr . Huang states , "Most human communication is nonverbal , including emotional communication" . There are ways to demostrate emotions through computers too . Computers can become an effective human instructor if they recognize the different emotions .

In conclusion , the technology usage of "The Facial Action Coding System" is a great usage of technology to read students emotional expressions because it will allow us to have empathy for eachother . We unconsciously imitate eachother's facial expressions . We could all help eachother in the world , and talk out our feelings instead of holding it in .
