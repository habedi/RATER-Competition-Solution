Students would definitelyÂ benifit from being able to take classes in home by the way of online classrooms. Especially in the time we are in now, the Coronavirus is traveling through the world and school is one of the biggest ways of continually spreading it. If students get the option to take classes online and in the home, they would still be getting their education and keeping everyone safe. Another reason is if students have to take a day off for a reason which could be being sick, family event, or just wanting to stay home. Taking the class online would stop them from getting behind in the class work and keeping up with everyone else in the class. Some say that the students should only be learning in the classroom should not have to take those matters in the home. Also if students missed school and could just take an online class to keep up. That would be a big reason for students to stay home and not come to school, because why deal with the stress of school when you have it all in your home.

Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, schools all over the United States have already been reverting to online classrooms. In fact, our own county is deciding whether or not to take this action, as to not spread the disease and giving students the option to still get their education. If the option to not take classes online was not put into action, students would come into school and spread the virus to one another, and possibily pass it to one of own teachers and take it into our home.

Another reason that online classrooms would be useful to the education of students is if a student is absent from a day of school and has to make up work for the classes that day. Instead of waiting until the student is back at school to get the work that was missed, they can go to the online classroom and do the work that was due, as to not fall behind in the ciriculum.

In conclusion, online classrooms would benifit the education system tremendously because it would help students not fall behind on work that was missed when missing a day of school. Also help eradicate the spread of a deady disease continuing to plague the United States.
