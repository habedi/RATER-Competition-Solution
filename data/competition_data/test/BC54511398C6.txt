Having the opportunity to go to Venus and explore would amazing for humans and scientists on Earth. It would give us the ability to learn more about the planets that are around us and why we are the only planet that humans are able to live it. It gives us insight on different planets and we can learn more about their climate, what the rock and sediment is made of, and if humans could have possible ever lived there. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers that it presents and the author supports his claim with educational details about how it can benefit humans, scientists, and our future.

Having a human able to go to Venus and be able to examine it, even if it is from a distant, can be very educational and help us succeed with many other projects. It can help us succeed by providing details about that planet and what it is like. Although we have pictures and images, nothing is better than a human being able to go and see it and report back exactly what he/she saw. In paragraph 8 sentence 1 it says how it will not only insight will be gained on the planet iself, but also because human cuiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. By being able to conquer this one task, humans will most likely be able to conquer many more things.

The author also tells us that being able to have a human go to Venus we will be able to learn more about it. All of paragraph 4 talks about why scientists are so interested on going to Venus and learning more about it. We can learn if it once was like Earth and why it has changed. There are many similiar features between Earth and Venus that support the idea that Venus was once like Earth. It is said, paragraph 4 sentence 3, that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and coould have supported various forms of life. Although it says probably, by all the facts and research that scientists have done it is most likely that forms of life have existed on Venus. In Paragraph 3 sentence 6 it lists some of the similiar features on Venus that are also displayed on Earth: volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes.

It is not possible for any form of life to survive on Venus currently because of the climate and what the planet is like. The planet itself is so different from Earth in many different ways: temperature, atmostpherical pressure, carbon dioxide, etc. In paragraph 3 the author described the characteristics of the planet and how that even though there are many dangers that could happened by sending a human to Venus, it could be very beneficial to society and to science. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure it 90 times greater than on Earth. The atmospherical pressure would be able to crush a submarine, even one that could go to the deepest parts of the ocean (paragrpah 3 sentences 3-4).

Scientists are working on a way to get humans to be able to go to Venus. Although it would be so beneficial if they were able to land on the planet itself, the climate does not allow that option. There is also sulfuric acid in the atmosphere that would corrode anything that tried to get down to the planet itself. Scientists have thought of many different things to try to get a human to Venus, but they have not tried any out yet. There was an idea of having humans in a blimp-like object and floating them above the planet by 30 miles. Although they wouldn't be able to get any rock or sediment samples, this would be safer to them than it would be trying to land on the planet itself.

In conculsion, I would like to say that the author did a very good job of supporting his idea that Venus is a worthy persuit despite the possible dangers. He provided enough information to make it relateable to Earth and he also explained why it would be beneficial to humans and to scientists. He explained how this would be a good opportunity to explore our neighboring planet and learn more about, not just planets themselves, but also but the rest of creation and why Earth is the only possible planet to live on and be comfortable in.
