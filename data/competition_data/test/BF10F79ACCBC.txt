I think they should make driverless cars but not all of them should be driverless they should just make some. I think people should have a choice of what they want and that would be way better. so peoeple don't complain about driverlesscars. But i do think that driverless cars are cool and is not a bad idea. There is alot of people that would like to have one.

They would help alot for people that can't drive so they would be way more helpful and i think there will be less car crashes. It wolud chnge alot but somtimes change is good and what if it makes this country better. In the passage it says that some companies are already thinking about making them by 2020. So i do think it's going to happen and i am really excited to see them and how they are going to work.

The future is here and we have to accept it i think it's for the best. And i guess we are going to see if they work out. I hope they do and i hope people love them.
