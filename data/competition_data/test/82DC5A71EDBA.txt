Dear school principal,

I think students should have at least a B average because most students who have a C average is on a football team, soccer team, baseball team or some other kind of school activity or sport. Some athletes may be the ''star'' of their team but have a C average because he does not study his school work but he would practice his sport whenever he got a chance. I know for a fact that most parents who have a ''star'' athlete may not really care about what their child gets in school except maybe gym class.

Most students with an A or B average is most likely not on a sport. If a student wants to be in a school activity he or she must have a B average because if they are on student council or something else they probably will make a bad decision for the school. My final reason is if students who sign up for school events who have a B or A

average will not be picked first by students because they are not the popular students. So, I think all students who are on a sports team or in school activity should have a B average.
