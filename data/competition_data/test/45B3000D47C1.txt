If we did a extracurricular activity everyday after school it could help us out a lot. Everyday after school each student should do a activity that gets their body moving instead of sitting down all day and not doing nothing. Some student's should try to do different activity's to meet new people and make new friends while other's just want to do it because it is fun.

I agree with doing at least one extracurricular activity after school. A lot of students do not like to go home after school because they do not want to be board all day because they have nothing to do at home. But when you do a after school activity you can have fun with your friends without a reason to be board. After school activity's can help keep you busy and out of trouble or it could help you bring your grades up if you are failing in one of your important classes that you are having trouble with learning in that class.

When extracurricular activity's pop up at your school you have to try it just for the fun that's in it. It may help you learn new games to share and play with your family and friends. When you are board at home you can just do the different activity's you learned at school such as Basketball, Soccer, computer games, or Building race cars and more to give you something to do when you are tired of playing on your phone or playing on your game system and you can not find anything else to do

Extracurricular activity's can really have a impact on your day in life. It can really help you get a lot of things done that you dont normally do on the daily bases instead of playing video games all day with your friends. These activitiesÂ can really help a board person have fun for a day
