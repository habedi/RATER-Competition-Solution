Some schools decide attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing, and the students can learning from them homes.

In my personal opinion, I think the option of some schools choose to take some classes online that is not a good idea because not all the students are going to do all the things if they are need to graduated with a good grades of the school, however is a good option because no all the students have the same opportunity to study here in the school or in home but have the possibility to study and do the school with all classes with needed, but is mostly depending of the students who wants take the classes online, because I think is more easy when someone explain the class for you, and you can understand all the things and do a good job.

But in the actuality no all the students have the same opportunity to came to school every day so all the students are going to do benefit because someones needs to work and support yourself, but if can do the classes online that's better for the students who don't have to much time to stay in the school, so now they have the opportunity to learning and watch some video conferencing online and they can finished the school online from home, however I think the students have the last decision to do, or not the classes online. In my opinion I think is better if we came to school and take the classes with us, because when we have some problems or questions, they can explain and help to understand more some things, but if we have the option to do the classes by way online I think no all the students are going to take too much time to do the classes.

For example I have one friend who came to school every single day, he do all of his work and he learn more because he doesn't have a job he have the possibility to study and get a good grades, he have more time to support in school, but if he get a job he is going to be tired most in the days in school, he are was to change is main about the school.

And other example, if a can change my classes and do online, honesty I don't want to do online my classes because I don't like the school a lot, I know I don't came to much to school because I need money to support my self, that's why I don't came to school too much and other thing i don't like the school is the language is difficult but i tried every single day to be better, and this is my last year of school, so I do everything I can to do this year better, and my opinion I never want to do my classes online I think the teachers are for helping and do the best they can for all the students. I am not agree with the schools teachers who have the idea to do the classes online because is more important the education for all the students, therefor the students improve the study in school more when we came to school and do the work.

In my conclusion I think the student have the last decision if they want to do the classes online or not ,I think is better if all the students came to school and they take all the classes with the teachers here in the school and the teachers can helping the students can learn more things that they are know, also thats better because you can distract and do a better job every day, and we can get a more education.
