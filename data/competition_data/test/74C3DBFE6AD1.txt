Extracurricular activities are necessary for the growing mind of the adolescence. Children, from a young age, should learn how to work with others so that, in the future, they can work with others to get their necessary work done. Children will also benefit from participating in extracurricular activities because it helps them gain better communicating, and social skills that helps them excel in the future. They should also participate, for then they can meet new people of different ages and make new friends that will be there for them through thick and thin. These are the reasons why I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities.

Participating in extracurricular activities provide a safe environment to learn how to work with others in a fun and productive way. When children of all ages learn how to work with others of different ages, they gain a necessary skill of communicating with others in a way they can get work done. For example, in the construction industry, adults have to figure out how, when, and who will work of certain parts of a major project because if they do not, nothing will get done and would put others in danger because the building was not built properly. It is also necessary to lean how to work with others, even if they do not get along. Learning how to work with others at a young age is extremely important because the young adolescences are oozing hormones that puts them through emotional stress and discomfort. Many students find it hard to work with others because they do not know how to properly communicate with others to complete projects. If children participate in extracurricular activities, they would learn how to communicate properly with their peers and friends to receive amazing grades for all their hard work.

Learning how to work with others is an important skill, especially if they are of different ages. when to kids have to work with one another, they would want to work with someone of the same age or grade. When kids grow up, after only working with those of the same age, they will not excel work because they can't work well with those of different ages, they will gradually find ways to work with them efficiently, but this forced change will not be to their benefit nor will this change be fast. The adolescence mind is still in the growing process, it is the best time to give proper schooling and commutative skills because this will help guide their mind which would be in a state of change and confusion. When properly informed of necessary information and hands-on teaching, the adolescent mind will grasp the new information and evolve into a proud and amazing person. They will keep the information close and will use what they have learned and put it into practice when they volunteer or get a job. Teaching with hand-on activities, like soccer for example, they learn how to communicate quick on their feet, when working on a yearbook with other students, they learn how to come to agreements and solutions on projects. In either activities, they learn how to have fun with lessons they will continue to use even if they do not realize that fact at first.

When participating in extracurricular activities children can meet new people and make new friends, who also enjoy activities of similar interests. When participating in extracurricular activities, children of similar interests will be in the same space, and that gives them the opportunity to make new friends and learn how to communicate with others. Extracurricular activities provide the perfect opportunity for students to meet other students of different ages and they learn new things from children who have a better understanding of the changes children go through unlike adults. While most adults try and provide comfort, they can no longer understand the emotional stress, pain, and physical changes the adolescence has to endure, of course they may have gone through it to, but that does not mean they still understand the stress or pain like they used too, because the subconscious of the human mind nine out of ten of the time puts their bad memories, pain, and discomfort into the deepest part of the mind to be forgotten like dust in the wind. So adults understanding adolescences mental panic is out of question. While adults can not understand, extracurricular activities provide the perfect place to find other students who understand and will provide comfort a student may ever need. Extracurricular activities also promotes self confidence and may raise the adolescences self-esteem to an exhilarating high, which then in turn gives the adolescence a more prideful, self confidence.

Extracurricular activities are the breading ground of opportunities and fun. When an extracurricular activity is given a chance by a student, the will learn and enjoy all sorts of things. Children will learn extraordinary life lessons in the most spectacular way, the learn that confidence comes from within, they may also learn making a friend is their choice and not their peers or families. They can even find a friend that will be forever at their side, to always have their back and beyond. Having students of all ages participate in extracurricular activities will in the end be the best thing to learn from. These activities may even give a glimpse of what they should expect and prepare for in the future. Extracurricular activities will surely help children excel into the unknown, and it will help them see that the best of things will only take them a little push.
