Dear Principle,

I think you should require all students to perform community service because that way every student in our school will be thinking in doing positive things and not bad things. Most of the kids this days are always thinking of being in gangs, fighting, and all those things. Don't you think it will be better if we help our community be a better place?

We can be an example to others schools. If we all work together every body will think this is the best school in the country, if not the world. I know most of the kids have things to do but in their free time they can always help. If we all work hard this will show other people that doing the right thing is important. Kids might think this is taking their time away, but what time? Time to play video games, time to be doing the bad things just to show people their cool.

So think about it and please make the right decision.

sincerely,

Me
