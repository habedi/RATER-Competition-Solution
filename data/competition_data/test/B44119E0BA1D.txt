If you had a choice to join this event , would you or would you not.

If you like helping people this is the program for you.

In this program you will be able to travel the world to help people in the other countries.

For example , A war is going on and they need medical or food help than you can go over and help those people in need of those things.

If your going to travel by ship Luke found the time to have some fun on board so maybe you can too.

The ship will feed you and give you a bed to sleep-in.

Luke said``It made me more aware of people of other contries and thier needs``.There are lots of reasons to be a part of this program.

Also you have jobs on the ship like cleaning up the ship or getting the food ready for the other people on board to eat. Also on the ship you may run into a storm so the crew will determan how bad the storm is , and if the storm is to bad you will have to go inside till the storm clears.

Then when you arive in the country that is in need you do what they need like getting a water suply or getting food for the people or getting the medical care the people need need and if you dont believe me than just ask Luke.

Then when you are don with what that contry needs then you can get back in/on the ship or waggon you came on than you can leave and return home and wait for the next country that needs.

So you really should join this program, but im not going to force you. So it`s your decistion.
