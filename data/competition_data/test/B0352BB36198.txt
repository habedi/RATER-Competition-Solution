Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that you are reconsidering the school's policy on cell phones. In my opinion, you should allow students to bring cell phones to school, but only let them use them during lunch, after school and other free times, as cell phones are a distraction in class. I also think that you should be very strict in enforcing the rule about no cell phones in class, for this reason. But, if you ban them, then students will just work harder to hide their cell phones, and pay even less attention in class. If you let students use their cell phones in lunch and other free times, then they won't have a reason to use them in class.

The education of America's children and teenagers is very important, and if they use cell phones in class because they can't any other time, then they will not be able to learn as much , and that would be very bad for our nation. Please consider my suggestion.

Sincerely,

A student
