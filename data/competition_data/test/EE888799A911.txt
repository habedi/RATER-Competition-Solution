I think that could be a good idea attend classes from home by way of online or video for the students that can not eat before go to school because they no have time get the bus, students want extra credits, and can take the time that they want in online classes.

Examples:

I don't eat breakfast before go to school, because I don't have time to do it or I will loss my bus. Because is normal see a student come to late for the bus, and when I talk with others students they always tell me that they are hungry, so this new way "class online" can benefit to us.

Some students want extra credit to get a better diploma so this be more easy for these students, or also can help for students that failed a class, because sometimes friends tell me retake this class or he can't graduate so this other fact why its a good idea this new way to teach to the students.

Students need to do something like go to hospital, get sick, or other thing can happen in their life, they will loss class and this can affect on their grades, so I think if we get online class this could not happen because every class is recording so when the student have the time to do the class online or watch the videos that they have to, they will keep their grades higher and dont worry about grades no more.
