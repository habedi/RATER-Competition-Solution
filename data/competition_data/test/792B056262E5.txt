The face on Mars was not created by aliens it is just natural landform. If you think that the face was created by aliens I'm sure have reasons but I bet I can make you change your mind on the face on Mars. There are multiple reasons why the face on Mars is a landform.

One reason why the face on Mars was not created by aliens is because Garvin said that the face reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Another reason why the face on mars was not created aliens is because when a picture of the face first appeared on a JPL web site said revealing a natural landform. It also said there was no alien monument after all.

Also another reason why the face on mars was not created by aliens would be that there was no alien markings. NASA even checked again for alien markings to make sure that thre were none hidden behind haze and they still did not find any alien markings. The last reason why the face on Mars was not created by aliens is because NASA took great clear pictures three times bigger then pixel size and found no sign of alien markings.

I hope I have changed you mind about thinking that aliens made the face on Mars. These reasons that I wrote about are all reasons why the face on Mars was not created by aliens. This is why the face on Mars is a natural landform.
