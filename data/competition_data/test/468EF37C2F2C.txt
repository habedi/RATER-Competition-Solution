Distance Learning as an Option

I'm agree that some students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, if the students are sick or have an appointment they never can missed a class day, the students can have a job and take the classes at the same time, and the students who get suspension they can have the classes online.

First, if the students are sick day never can missed a class day. Sometimes, some students dawn sick and they missed the class, but if they attend classes of online they just have to go in the web site and take the classes. For example: Once I was sick for two week and I missed the classes for those days, but the schools offer me to attend classes from home. That helped me, because I don't continue missing classes and I did all my classwork and homework that I missed. I think so, this can be easy for teacher, because when I was sick my teacher just explain me and give me the homework , and we end the video conferencing. Also, it is a good idea be able to attend classes from home, because if they students have an appointment they just can do a video conferencing or can do online if they are doing somethings.

Second, the students can have a job and take the classes at the same time. Some students who come to regularly classes they just have a part-time, but they want get a job all day. If they have distance learning they can work and take the classes. For example they can have a video conferencing in lunch time or they can ask to the manager if they can have a hour of break. I have a friend who took distance learning, he worked from 7:00 a. m to 9:00pm. But he talked with his manager if they can have two hour of brake and when his has his break he called by video conferencing to his teacher. Also, it is interesting, because they can learn to be responsible, be organized and used them time wisely. If the students come tired from them job they can be relax in them bed and can do them homework in online.

Finally, the students who get suspension can have classes online. In this year of school I saw liked six fights, it is too many fights. The principal give them five days or more of suspension, and they missed those days of classes. They can have this privilege of have classes online or video conferencing. Although, it is not problem of the school, because they look for the problem, but can be a good action for the school give them this privilege and don't missed the classes. Also, when they come back to school can have another problem with come else. In my opinion the school have to give them all year of suspension and give them distance learning, for they can learn to be good person and understand that the school it is for study don't for fight. Anyways they benefit, because they don't missed classes and they always can graduate. The parents can be attentive to his son and her daughter that they are doing the right thins or if they are doing the work.

In conclusion, the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Can be a good idea that all schools have the distance learning option. This can help all the students and be easy for the teachers. To some students cannot benefit, because maybe they don't have a job or don't make problems. Next, the students can be sick or can have an appointment with the doctor and they just can do a video conferencing. Also, the parents can see if her daughter or his son are doing the homework or pay attention to the teacher. Some students benefit because they want have a regularly job and don't can, because they have to go to school. In my opinion, if they made me make a choice if I want a distance learning I will accept, because it is a good opportunity to have another things to learn and make many things different on the same time.
