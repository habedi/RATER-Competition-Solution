I agree with the author when he suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.

Although I agree even more when he says that is presents danger.

There are pros and cons on working with Venus. I agree with him because if him and his scientest discover things dealing with the phisical in venus or just plane facts it could do well for them.

Yet, the cons are extreme. In paragraph 2 it states " No space craft survived the landing after a few hours." The space men are going to have to learn new techniques in order to discover and survive. Another detail to go along with that cause is in paragraph 3 where it states " The conditions are far more extreme then anything humans encounter on earth." Theres gonna be a lot of tracks the men are going to face and have to learn to adapt.

In paragraph 4, it says that " atronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like thing plamet in our solar system." Maybe this is why the author suggest to look into it becuase it was once like us. Maybe he wants to know how it change so much.

Maybe in the near future we can be able to discover why those things happendand why.
