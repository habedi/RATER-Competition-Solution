He wanted to jion the program because it would be an opportunity of a life time for luke. He could travel the world see new things meet new people and make more friends when he goes to the program.

He wanted to jion the army service and help out so the told him to say in what he was doing and that he was on bored with the army. He helped take horses to greece on ship and that is hard to do with 335 horses on bored the ship,and he had to take care of them by feeding them,getting the poop up and out of there cage. When he was helping one night he almost fell off bored the ship and went into the dark Atlantic but lukly there was a melt bar that stopped he from falling off the edge of the ship.

When the horses got off the ship the men could play basketball,volleball,and table tennis with all the men on bored.

He started in 1945 with his friend from high school .When he left the army in 1947 he was glad to do all those things he had done to help all those people in need. He was als hapy that he got to travel to all the places he had always wanted to go to in the world to help people he didn't know that was in need that he got to know as a friend.

When he was done he went back home and did something new with his life again to see what he could learn about then.

My conclusion are that he was really happy for helping peopl in need. I think what made him the happy's was that he got to travel the world to help people. He went to China,Greece,and other cool place like that.
