It is a landform because a landform is a pack of dirt compressed for years whitch means it isnt an alien from mars also called martians martions live up to 100 years on mars because its so hot and they have adapteed to it

Martions can not live on earth all the chemicals and gasses in our atmosphere will kill a martion and a mesa is a rock that is shaped like a face but isnt a face so i know that it is not a martions face and the mars rover drove for ever just to find life on mars and it didnt find anything not even water which a planet needs to have water to provide the nutrients and other good stuff that helps us live on planet earth

The mesa shows thta it has evelept rock like textures so that prove that it is a rock not a martions face a rock can form in many different sizes and shapes do you see the cracks on the left side of it it has cracked over the years and it take rocks years and years to start to break away bit by bit
