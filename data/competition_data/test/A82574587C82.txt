in the article "driverless cars are coming" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars and that means im against the development of these cars because there are so many negative aspects and not a lot of positive aspects which mean that the driverless car is not that safe. some of the positive aspects of driverless cars are: 1. googles cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. 2. within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. 3. the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowinging far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. some of the negative aspects of driverless cars are: 1. these smart-roads systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to exisiting roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical. 2. the sensors werent there, the computers werent there, and the mapping wasnt there. radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. 3. presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. as a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. this is why im against the development of driverless cars because they arent that safe unless they have a human driver in the driverless cars at all times. the driverless cars would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus but the cars would still need a human driver to have control at all times. the driverless cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents, but so far, google cars arent truly driverless. without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? for starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors. googles modified toyota prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, and an inertial montion sensor. the most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. the combination of all this input is necessart for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own. it costs a lot of money to make driverless cars actually driverless.. they have to spend two hundred million dollars on a radar that is on top of a hill. the car can handle driving funstions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. in fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselver, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready yo take over when the situation requires.
