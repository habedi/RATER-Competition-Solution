Dear: TEACHER_NAME

Hi I am a student at your school that thank that you should not make were you must have a B average to play in sports and other activities because 85% of the student in school have a C average. If you make it were you have to have a B average then kids might not do any of there work. Kid that play sports don't do it just because they like the sport they do it because they want some time away from home to let go some anger if they had a bad day. Like me I play football because I don't like to be home all the time and when ever I have a bad day I hit people harder to get some of the anger out of me. Me I have a C average I have tried my hardest to make a B average but I couldn't do it. But if you decide make it that way can you also make it were if you try your best in class and you are a good student that you can still play. Thank you for reading this and ha
