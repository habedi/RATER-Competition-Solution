Professor TEACHER_NAME:

I would like to talk to you about the policy change that might occur. I do not agree with you on this subject. I do not think that only letting students play sports if they have a B average or higher is fair. It is not fair because some students' ability to learn is lower than others.

Some of the teachers do not even know how to teach.

It might not help some students get scholarship's for college if then cannot play. All in all, this is not fair.

The first reason why a possible policy change is not fair is that some students' learning ability is lower than most.

Some students do not have the attention span.

I mean, no one can help that they cannot understand things as well as others.

Truly, some people cannot help that it is harder to learn.

The second reason why a possible policy change is not fair is that some teachers do not even know how to teach properly.

Some teachers just give you board work, and that is what you do all year.

They do not even bother to stand up in front of the class and teach the class how to do things. We, most of the time, have to figure the work out on our own.

When a test rolls around, we all make bad grades because we have not been taught anything. All in all, some teachers need to be replaced.

The last reason why a possible policy change is not fair is that it will not help some students get a scholarship for college.

Some students rely on sports to be able to get into college.

Some parents do not have enough money to pay for college. If you change the policy, you are going to have a lot of students flipping burgers at Burger King for the rest of their life.

If you do not change the policy, you are probably going to have a lot of NFL players come from our school.

Clearly, you do not need to change the policy.

Now do you see why you do not need to change the policy for playing sports? It would be harder on students that have a lower IQ.

Some teachers do not even know how to teach. It will also be hard on students that rely on sports to get money for college.

In conclusion, a policy change would not be the best idea you have ever come up with.
