Dear Principle,

Many schools take part in sports and after school activities for students pleasure and fun, but some schools are only allowing students with high enough grades. I think schools should not require students to have a grade of at least a B grade average because it would prevent some great athletes from entering sports, it would make less people interested in sports, and it would make students more nervous in school. I hope this letter is convincing.

First, it would prevent good athletes from entering sports. Most students don't have a grade average of a B and have a grade average of a C. if you prevent students from entering sports that don't have an average of a B, less people would join sports or other activities because of there grade average.

Second, less people would join activities and sports because they would have to bring up there grade average. if only people that had a grade average of a B joined sports, there would be a considerably smaller amount of people joining sports. also less people would join sports and activities because most of there friends wouldn't be able to do activities and sports with them. clearly you should allow students to join without a grade average of a B.

Lastly, it would make student more nervous. If only students that had a grade average of a B joined sports and activities, than students would be nervous because they would have to work very hard to keep there graded up to a B average. the students would be very nervous during tests and quizzes and it could even bring there grads down even lower. clearly everyone should be allowed to do sports.

in conclusion, all students should be allowed to do sports because less people would join sports, students would be nervous, and great athle
