Dear Principal,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME, I am a student at your school. I believe the students of this school should have a say in are requirements for community service. I will explain my reasons for my recommended requirements in the paragraphs that follow. I hope you agree with them. But, if you disagree in my views that is fine, we all have our own opinion.

I believe we should not have any requirements on the amount of community service we do. I believe we all should do a little, but there is no punishment if we don't do any. There could be a reward for the top 10% of the community service workers, but I don't think it should be required that we work in our community.

There are many reasons why service isn't being completed in this school and community. Some kids don't have rides and can't get to the place where the service is being held. Some have conflicting schedules. Many children plain don't want to do the service. They either don't want to do it, or they can't do it because they have to watch a younger sibling. Some kids have that old I-can't-because-I-have-to-go-to-the-dentist excuse, which is totally phony.

I suggest you give kids chances to help in the community. You could set out a sign up sheet to go to an Animal shelter of Food Bank. And for kids who don't have rides you could car pool. Another idea is you could take a field trip to a park. First you could tell the kids that if they would like to play they have to pick up trash around the park first. Then when they are finished you could reward them and let them play.

Well, there are many ways to institute community service into our school. But, I still do not believe it should be required because many children can't because of circumstances. But, if service is done is should be rewarded. Well, that's all for me.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
