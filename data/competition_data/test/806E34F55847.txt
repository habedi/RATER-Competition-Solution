Dear Principal,

In high school there are many difficult decisions to make. What classes to take? Do I want or need a job? Who should I associate with? What dress should I wear to the prom? You know, things like that. I know that you have recently stated that you would like all students to participate in some form of community service and even though it is a very stressful and busy time I completely agree.

I think that it is very important to give to your community and always try to help out. I believe that some services could be picking up trash, tutoring, helping plant flowers around that school to make it look a little more welcoming. I also think that participating in this activity teaches responsibility, respect for hard work, and it also gives us an intake on things outside of high school. This could also help some students decide on which career path to take. Depending on if they might realize some improvements that could be made to make the community better as a whole and decide to be on the town committee. Or even if they enjoy teaching younger kids and wish to follow a path into educating.

This project, I believe, would better both our school and community in the long run. I hope that my perspective has helped you on your decision and I wish to thank you for your time and dedication you put into the bettering this school .

Sincerely your student,
