Dear principal,

Students should not be able to use cell phones during school hours .Cell phones in school are a distraction even if you are in lunch or free period. If students are allowed they would be thinking about there text messages in class instead of their school work. If one of your friends is in lunch or free period and you are in class they might send a text message to you even if your in class. It is a distraction to all students. It is very hard to concentrate in your academic work if someone next to you is using there cell phones. If you are trying to study in the library and one of your friends keeps receiving text messages you will be distracted and you will start fighting with your friend to turn it off, and there is a friendship loss over a phone. Also rumors will travel through the school much faster than usual. schools would be much harder for some kids if phones are used during school hours , which should not be permitted from my point of view . Schools would be a better learning environment if cell phones are not permitted during school hours .
