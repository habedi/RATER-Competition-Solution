Your sitting home alone with nothing to do wasting away with boredom, if so then you should do some extracurricular activity. I agree because, I think kids having to do extracurricular activities for school help them, and lets them help. These activities give kids things to do, may help them make friends, and gives them a chance to help others.

First, extracurricular activities give young people something to do. This will get them out of their houses. These children have to go and help their team with the extracurricular activity that they chose. It will also make them use their brains. It teaches them to think outside of the box and to make creations from a thought. Lastly, it can also help them manage their time wisely. If they have other activities that give work or are near the same time, this will help them by learning what is more important or what they care more about. Some students might struggle to find time to do these activities, but they can chose what and when their activities should be.

Secondly, these activities will help kids make new and lasting friendships. Make them work with others. Because these are all run by the school you will have to meet new people regardless, so why not try to make a lasting impression to the people you work with. Have them go on group outings. The children may not be friends with anybody yet and are looking for something to do, group activities are prefect, not only do you do fun stuff with your group, but also get to know them a bit better. They will help each other. If you have problems with home work or a problem with some one around school the others in your group can, and will help you with the problems that you may have. Kids may be shy and don't want to talk to others they don't know this will help them break the ice with a few people so they have some friends to hold them up.

Lastly, this gives them a chance to help others. They can help friends. if a friend needs help on understanding their part of the extracurricular activities or home work then you can help them to understand what they are suppose to do. You can help the school. If you are in student council and think of a way to better the school then you have the power to do what you think is right for the school and students. Finally, this give students a chance to help the community. The students could find ways to benefit the place where they live making it cleaner, safer, or in anyway better. If someone is having a hard time think of how good it would feel to help them out.

Extracurricular activities do influence kids to better themselves, their school, and community. One way was giving these students something to do to improve themselves. Another is making new friends making others lives better helping both school and community. Last is helping others in any way needed for home work, a project, or just by listening. Think of how much better it would feel to help others even if you didn't want to join an extracurricular activity.
