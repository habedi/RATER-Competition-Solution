Summer is a time of fun, and relaxation. It is also a time where you stop using your brain, which then leads you to forgot a lot of critical information, when it comes to school. Which explains why some schools require kids to do these summer projects, but the only way this project will be useful, is if the project is teacher-designed, rather than student-designed.

I remember my 8th grade summer so well, because I did not do a single thing when it came to school. I was either sleeping, watching TV, or hanging out with friends. Although it was a very fun summer, I was not prepared for my freshman year of highschool. This lead to me having a very hard year when it came to my grades, and this all stems from me being lazy and ignornant, when it came to the difficulty to highschool. I am sharing this information because if the summer project was student-designed, the students would make it very easy, and not work their mind in the places they need to, which would lead them to being behind the ball in school. Teachers on the other hand, would challenge the student's mind, and give the student important information that he/she will need to know for the next grade. This would give the student a big head start going into the next grade that will prove very helpful in the long run. Although the student will be annoyed at first, in the end, the student will be thanking the teacher for giving them important and maybe even interesting information.

One issue with today's education, is that kids don't think outside the box, so if the summer project was controlled by the teacher, they could assign a project that could allow the student to think outside the box, and open up about their beliefs. In today's education, students are treated like robots. You take a bunch a notes, do homework, and then take a test to wrap up that unit, and repeat until the year is over. This is not the teachers fault, because they are required to teacher everything they are told to do. This does not allow the teachers to be creative, and allow the students to think in ways they usually don't. So while you could argue tha teachers could have another boring project over the summer, I think that the teachers would be estatic, to be able to fully control the the outline and rubric of the project, that would help expand the minds of the students.

Summer break is a time for fun and relaxation, but it is also a time to keep your mind sharp, and that would not happen if a student controlled the project, because they would assaign a project that would be super easy, and take very little effort. While if the teacher controlled the project, they would help the student be prepared for the next grade, and help the student think in ways they probably didn't think before. Which is why the summer project should be teacher-designed.
