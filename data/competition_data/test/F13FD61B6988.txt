This essay will be explaining few of the reasons why Venus is in fact an intresting discovery in the universe, and depict why it is yet so dangerous.

The first reason why Venus is a worthy pursuit towards the information it consist about, is because if NASA were able to test rocks and other materials, then it would impact the history of science. Science is an amazing attribute to society and if NASA could develop the technology to be able to enter the Venus atmostphere then all the lost questions will be answered. It is also, very similar to Earth.

If the danger of Venus could be determined to an exact pin point then we could use the results to fix and calculate other situations. Each time Earth as send a space aircraft to Venus, it had only lasted moment before it melted. If the substance could be tested then it would influence the world in a scientific way.

In conclusion, despite the critical mess of Venus, many people find it special and unique. The more scientist that get involved with making new technology to show Venus' value, can also help bring the world closer.
