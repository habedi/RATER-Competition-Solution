Dear Principal,

I think you allowing student to bring phones to school if they are off during class and is only brought out during lunch or free time is a good idea because personally i would enjoy if we would be able to have our phones out during lunch. You can text people, call people, and go on the internet . Also i think it will help us if we have our phones out during lunch. I think it will be a bad idea if students don't have cell phone at all during school. A lot of student like to text and if we can have our phones out during free time and lunch I think it will benefit us a lot because a lot people would be happy and might do will in class and school.

We wouldn't have to wait till after school to text or call people. Also is it a really bad idea if do have phones out during lunch or free time. I don't think it will be a bad idea if we do. Also if we have our phones out during class i think it will cut our learning down and people would fail or be behind if we do have it during class but having it during lunch I think will be a great idea if we were allowed to take our phones outs. If we have our phones out during school we probably wouldn't now what to do on our classwork or homework an we could fail a test. Principal i know you are in charge but can you please let have our phone out during lunch and free time.

From, one of your student
