If you were or are a student who and was suddenly forced by your principle to participate in extracurricular activities how would you feel. you would probably not like to have to do something regardless of what you think. It could give you hardly anytime to do what you want to do with your life, maybe you like the idea of playing a sport or writing a story but not everyone has the time or interest in stuff like that.

There is many negative effects on the students and teachers that are caused by the principles decision to force extra work on the students and teachers of my school, I believe that there is not reason for extra work.

being force to do something that you don't want to do is annoying but tolerable, but when it is not letting you have any time for yourself its too far.

There are many negative effects on the students. Anything can be effected by someones decisions or actions, I believe that the Principle's decision to force students to participate in extracurricular activates will only negatively effect them and make things harder for them in the future. Students have it hard enough going to school five times a week, having homework, and projects and still have to deal with life at home like choirs or maybe they have an after school job that they need to do, what ever it may be students have it hard enough and would not appreciate it if they were forced to do more than they already have to do.

Students are not the only ones who are effected from this unfair change, the students need teachers to teach them and keep them in check.

Like students teachers have a life of there own and don't need more work to do.

Their is not reason for extra work. There is no good reason why students need to work harder than they already do, if anything is is doing the opposite of what it is try to do, intended giving students a chance to find something new or get better at what they like it forces then to ether do something they are not comfortable doing or not letting people work on what they want to do in the way they want to do it. Nobody likes to be forced to do something, even if it is something they are interested in it only makes them feel like they are being controlled.

The reasoning is not right, not everyone is the same and some people don't have the option to try new things but this is not the way to do it and I think that many students would agree with me saying that.

this will cause more good than bad fro the people involved in this decision. In the end people are not just going to like something because you make them do it, you have to let them do things on their own, forcing people to do things will only make them dislike it.
