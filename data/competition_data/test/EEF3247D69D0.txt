Some schools propose the idea of distance knowledge as an option for students to take online classes or having meetings from home. I honestly don't agree because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school and not at home, socialize better and understand what is outside of the world. Here is why I don't agree by this reasons.

My first reason of why, I dont agree that students should take classes at home is because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school. My mom always taught me that is better having a good education when you are in the environment, because you see people around you that are having the motivation to learn everyday. When my mom was in high school, her education was easy because she got the support by her teachers in any classes that she couldn't understand. Many of her friends were working hard to get good grades, she never did homework at home; it was difficult for her to study in an environment where people usually can get lazy in their own space to have any break. "You can't compare a temple with a laboratory science, both are too opposites and what happens with school is the place where you have to focus for what you are learning while our home is the space where we can take any break after our hard work". My mom

My second reason of why, I don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students can socialize better when they are at school. As my own experience, we have the opportunity to meet other students while we our in classes. For example: "I am very shy to ask a teacher any question, so I go and I ask to another student who does understand what the teacher is explaining". Meeting new people in school is a good experience because you can make connections with any other students and teachers also; thanks to that communication, we can have that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. Therefore school can be our first path of having a good or professional communication with any person, for example, applying for a job.

Another reason of why, I don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students will understand what is outside of the world. As I said before, socialize can give us that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. The position of school of giving good education to students every year is the real path to prepare us for what is outside. One of my teachers, Mr. Generic_Name, shared to all of his class of how hard workers we have to be in life, he never gave up on his goals. At the beginning, it was hard for him after he graduated from high school to college because everything was different for him; meeting new people with a new environment wasn't easy, but he always tries his best of himself by using the same method that school gave him, by been open mind and having good communications with others. Mr. Generic_Name also believes that life is always a challenge for us and is better to face that instead of been afraid. "I you think that school is the worst place where you can't handle it and you prefer to lock yourself at home, then you won't like what is outside".

Some students may argue that is a better option to take classes at home because they don't feel comfortable with other students, if a student have an accident;the student can finish any work at home, or school is not the best improvement for them.

the reason of why some students don't get comfortable in school is because they might have the afraid for other students who want to feel superior from others and bullying is an obstacle for the them and not have the opportunity to defend themselves, or the other reason might be that they don't like to socialize. I personally believe, that students can find a better way to solve their problem by communicating with their own parents or with the teacher that they can trust, figuring out a way to make the student feel comfortable. If the student doesn't like to socialize and prefers to stay at home, the student needs to understand that even outside is not a paradise, people in school who can make him feel that the student is not alone and sometimes is better to talk.

Finally, if some schools offers the opportunity to study at home can be a good benefit for the student. Even tho is not a bad option studying at home, the best option to understand everything in classes is when you are in a building with other people with the same level as you are of learning and you can share any of your experience with others. One of this circumstance that can happen in life for example: If a student has an accident were he/she can't return to school for a while, is understandable that the student can do their work at home, but after they return as healthy they were is better for them to go to school because the student can still have the support from their teachers.
