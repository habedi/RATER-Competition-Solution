I believe that policy one is the best one to go with. Policy one still restricts students from using their phone anytime they want be still gives them access to it. Also as long as the phones are off and not detracting anyone i think its perfectly fine.

Why i believe its ok for students to have their phone at school? I believe students should be able to use their phones because as long as its off it shouldn't matter. Also being able to use it during a certain time of the school day is also a good thing for a student because they may not know if their parents may want them to ride the bus instead of being a car rider. For example if a student isn't allowed to use their phone during a certain time of the school day and their parents text them saying they have to ride the bus, but the student doesn't get it then what is the student going to do. Because now the student has no way home , and all of this could of been avoided if the student was allowed their phone during a certain time of the school day.

Now you know why i believe that the principle should go with policy one. Allowing the student to still have access to their so is important. I believe with this new policy students will be able to focus a little bit more in class but also still being able to use their phone at a certain part of the day.
