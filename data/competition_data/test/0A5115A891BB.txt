I think the idea of driverless cars is a good idea at some points but it also can be dangerous because what if the cra messes up when its driving its self and you hit something and the person dies that was in the car who would be held responsible for that person loosing there lives over a silly mental mistake but i think its a good idea also because if you go on a trip and you feel like resting with outh pulling over to the side of the road you can just make your car drive for you.

But i really like the idea of what google did when it said that the seat vibrate when you are in danger or you are about to hit something. Or maybe when you have an important text all you have to do is let your car drive its self while you text whoever back i think it would stop mostly all the wrecks from texting and driving. Or another positive fact is what if you had a baby in the back seat and it was crying you can let your car drive while you stop the baby from crying or ETC.

Or if you were smoking or eating something your car would drive for you i think that would stop all the wrecks from people. But how does your car know where to go do you put a address or a destanation where you want to go.

Also another good idea is if you had an disabled human being that cant walk or drive then that would be good for them cause they dont got to worry how to get places or depend on a ride from somebody.

I like how some of these cars have sensors to alert the driver of something there about to hit or someone is about to hit them, another negative thing is what if a child gets in a car and they get the car starts to drive by there self and the child dies or something. And would this effect the age you have to get a liscence?

But overall I think it should be up to the person that purchaes the car and it should be there responsibilty and there risks, I dont think that the dealer ship should be held accountable for there risks.
