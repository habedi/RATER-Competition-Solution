Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that you may soon require all students to do community service as part of school. I am a busy person and I don't think you should add community service to the curriculum. I think that I have a better solution to this problem. Instead of requiring all students to do community service, you could simply put in classes that are dedicated to helping the community. That way, people who enjoy helping the community will be able to do it in school and be graded on it.

Another reason why I don't think you should require people to do community service is because some people already are required to do community service for other events. For example, as part of me being confirmed, all my classmates and I are required to perform 10 hours of community service. I also know many other people who have to do the same thing for religious groups and clubs. If you added community service to the school curriculum, it would only burden the lives of people who have many other obligations in their lives. That is what I think and I'm sure many others would agree with me.

However, if you were to require all students to do community service. It would be optimal if you made it a manageable number of hours. Or perhaps you could simply make it part of certain classes instead of doing it outside of school as I stated before. After all, I and many other students my age enjoy having time to ourselves away from school and it would really bog down our lives if community service was added to the already long list of things that a student must do in a day such as sports, clubs, homework, etc. I also think it would be unfair because I know many people who already have trouble getting there homework done as it is and adding community service to that would make it even worse.

Please consider the proposition I have made. As I think it will benefit us all in the long run. Do not add community service to the list of requirements of school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
