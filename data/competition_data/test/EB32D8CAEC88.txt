Dear, Principal I feel that if you only let the kids with a b average be in sports or in other after school activities then there would be less people involved in things. Yes its good that you want kids to do better in there classes but making this rule will not change anything the school will just lose more kids in sport teams , debate teams, and any other after school activity. Also for some kids after school activities is all they look forward to during the day. Plus a C average is still passing I mean i would understand if all the kids were failing and only cared for after school activities but that's not the case so pleas do not make this new rule.

Instead of making this new rule why don't you try to make the kids get better grades by offering then scholarships for there after school activities that way they will want to bet better grades and still participate in after school programs.
