Dear, principal

I think that not all students should have to do community service. Not everybody has the time to do community service. some people have homework to do and others have families that they have to help or deal with like there brothers and sisters. Not everyone has the time some people have the time but not everyone. I don't think that students should be required to do community service not only that but some people have more important things to worry about than community service. I'm not saying that its a bad idea or any thing like that. Just that some people don't have the time to do community service. Other people may have the time but I know that not every student has the time to do community service.

I do hope that you read this letter and consider the possibility's of what I have just written. thank you for your time.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
