Summer's here and you want to rest, tan at the beach, and shop with friends. However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These assignments may be teacher-designed or student-designed, but there may be problems that could arise when the project is student-designed. Teacher-designed projects are more easy to understand and accurate.

Students don't always know the curriculum for the school year, which makes it a lot difficult for them to design an entire summer project. For example, let's say it was a project for math. The student may make a mistake on the assignment because they don't know what the correct answer was, which will also confuse the student who is working on the assignment, and give them the wrong information. It's also harder for the student to plan out which problems to place in the beginning or the end. However, for teachers, it's not a whole lot simpler, but it's still a lot easier for them try to figure things out. They should know at least a gist of what they would teach throughout the school year, and put problems on the project that'll help the students practice material. Teacher-designed projects more planned out in preparance for the school year.

Teacher-designed materials are more easily understood than student-designed assignments. Students aren't as experienced in formatting things as well as teachers are. Teachers have been teaching for a while so they know how they should word the questions in order to help their students understand the questions fully. Student-designers on the other hand, may have a bit of trouble wording. It's important for the student who is working on the project to be able to understand even just the question in order to solve it, but if the question is complicated, then just solving one problem could take more time than necessary than if the teacher had created the question instead in the first place.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects are way more effective than student-designed ones. They are easy to understand, and more accurate than the projects students could've made. Teachers help format questions easily, and know how to create the project in the first place, to help prepare for the school year throughout the summer.Â
