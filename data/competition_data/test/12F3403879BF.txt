Dear Principal,

You should allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off during class time. I suggest this because it would mean letting students use technology that is available to us. You should do this because some, and most, technology is educational.

Technology can teach us many things. You should allow us to have our cell phones during free time and lunch periods because it wont get in the way of our learning, due to it being in our free time. The students would enjoy having their cell phones during the available times because they complain that you should let them.

I strongly suggest you allow us to have the technology in schools because it would make students happier, and if used when allowed, it wouldn't get in the way of teaching. Studies say that technology in the classrooms helps some students learn.

Thank You For Considering The Policy,

One Of Your Students
