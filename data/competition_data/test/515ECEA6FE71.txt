The Face on Mars became very interesting in the time when it was found. The day the picture was taken was a very shodowy day, as it is said in the article the photo was taken in April a usual cloudy day in Mars. The camaras back then focused less than what our camaras do now. On April 8, 2001 when the picture was taken again it was summer and a cloudness day in Mars. When they saw the picture it was just a mesa. You have to understand that the time has pased and camaras have changed so in 2001 the camaras were better. So later on we can understand why because of the clouds that especific moment the mesa could of looked like a face.

Now that you have learned that it was all just that the camaras back then were a little blury, now you have to now that the Face on Mars was just a natural land form. First the article states that mesas or a butte are also just a common land form. This kind of landforms are also found in the earth around the American West. The whole Face on Mars was just caused by a natural process in Mars, by the weather. So now you have learned that all of this was a natural process of a masa that day they took a picture and it happend to look like a mans face.

After all of this research that scientist have found, we have all learned the real image of the Face on Mars. Yes this first discovery or thought brought a lot of popularity and fame but now we now the truth. It took lots of time and years to come to this point scientist will keep searching for evidence but we all know this was all just a natural land form and a picture taken at a right time.
