Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am in eighth grade. I think that requiring everyone to perform community service would be a great idea. If everyone threw their trash on the ground, our school and community would be a dirty place. I know that would be a bad thing. It wouldn't hurt if everyone went outside every couple of days and picked up litter. If we did that our school and community wouldn't get trashed and people would see that we really do care about our school. We could also recycle plastic, paper, and aluminum. By recycling aluminum, we could earn some extra money for our school. That would make it easier for us to do more things like field trips, more equipment for our school, and books for our library and our class rooms. We could also use that money for show choir or sport activities. It wouldn't be as much money to buy their dresses and suits.

This is my position on weather students should be required to do community service or not. I hope you think about this and make a good decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
