Dear Principal,

I believe that students should not be required to perform community service. I feel that each student and their families have the right to not perform community service. But I do feel that one who performs community service should get some sort of reward. Maybe extra credit points or a party would be sufficient.

I think that students should have a choice of whether or not to perform community service, because I have experience with community service, and I find it rather boring and tiring. If they decide not to do it, they might not be well thought of, and that is their own problem. Another reason for why I think that the students and their families should have a choice on performing community service is because they might not be able to. Maybe a student's family does not own a car, and the work site is too far away to walk in a reasonable time. Or, someone in the family has died, and one parent has to work seventy-five hours a week, for a relatively low pay check. They also might be constantly busy, and just do not have the time for it.

I would probably be more inclined in performing community service with incentives. This would probably give the students more motivation, thus, more community work would get completed. If they offered extra credit, a party, or maybe a homework pass, more students would work for their community. In the long term, they might get used to it, and feel that life is missing something, and would perform community service more often.

The community service that the students perform, would also help students to grow closer to each other, and become mentally and sometimes physically stronger. It would also help the community. The students would be much more inclined to do it if some of the work that would need to be done directly benefited them, like a new park or skate park. This would not only help the community, but it would help the students too, whether the liked it or not, or even realized it, or not. The community would definitely realize it, and would feel much better about passing the world down to the next generation.

Sincerely,
