Dear, Principle

You should allow students to bring their cell phones to school.

One reason is, they can call their parents.

Also, they can keep then off when they are in classes.

Last, the students can have them out during free time, and when they are at lunch.

Students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school so they can contact their parents.

First, if they stay after school, they can let their parents know they need picked up.

They could stay after for a sport and they needed their cell phones to let their parents know they needed picked up when they were done with practice.

Next, they could ask their parents to bring their gym clothes or something else they forgot.

If they forgot a project or some homework at home they can let their parents know they forgot it and see if they can bring it to school for them.

Second, the students could keep their phones off during the classes.

If they keep their phones off then they won't be bothering them while they are in classes.

If they have them on in a class and it goes off it could disrupt some ones concentration if they are taking a test.

Also, they won't have their phones on in the middle of class so that they won't be tempted to take it out of their pocket and text or call someone.

Last, If they keep them off in classes the kids won't have out their phones texting each other answers to a test if they are taking one.

Last, the students could have their phones on during free time and lunch time.

If they needed to borrow some ones notes because they needed to get caught up on them they can ask the person to meet them by a place so they can borrow the notes.

Next, they can keep their phones on during free time to let someone know that they are done using the notes, or to help them on something that they are stuck on.

Finally, they could let someone borrow their phone because they don't have on or just forgot it at their house.

In conclusion, you should let the students have their cell phones in school.

They could keep them off in the class but then have them out during free time.

Also, they could call their parents to remind them to pick them up or to bring them something.

That is why students should be allowed to have their phones at school.
