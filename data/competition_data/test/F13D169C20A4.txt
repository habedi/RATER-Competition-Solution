Would you like to go on a life changing adventure? People should go to Europe and see what amazing things they learn, and what they didn't know about Europe.

Plus, if a best friend of yours asked you to go to Europe with him ,you knew that it would be an opportunity of a lifetime.

But you will never know if you don't go. People should go because you get to spend time off of work and just relax and hang ou twith the family. Go to just enjoy the precious time with your family there.

Just go and get out there and adventure because you might have teenagers in the house who's always on their phones, well here's your chance to change that around to getting them off their phones and get outside and play more often.

In conclusion, families should just go to whatever place they want to go. To have fun and just get out there and have the time of your life. Instead of just getting out of the house to go to the movie theater. Whatever advetnure you made, that awareness will always stay with you.
