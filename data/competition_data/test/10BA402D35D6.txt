In my opinion i truly believe that people should not be able to use or operate cell phones while driving. There a several reason that i think support this theory. For instance the danger factor, driving while on the phone can pull your concentration from anything and everything that you do. These distractions can easily cause a accident which is putting your life and future at risk. I personally think that the cons of driving and using your phone far outweigh the pros and here why.

One of the reasons that i think that driving and using the phone is unacceptable is because it causes a major distraction. Diverting your attention from driving a vehicle at any time is a enamours mistake because it only takes seconds to crash. Making a small text or call can easily cause you thousands in damages to your car and even another civilians car. Not to mention it can also create a complications with the insurances companies and cause a spike in your current insurance rate.

Another big risk and something that is common among drivers nowadays is being sued. This does not occur very often but can be one of the most troubling and biggest hits to a person's pocket. One second your looking at your phone to check and text and the next you're dealing with a lawsuit that can cause you to pay thousands upon thousands of dollars. When in a scenario like this the opposing person can claim any kind of allgulations weather they be true are not, and you must be liable to either pay up or fight the case in court.

What really are some pros of driving and texting and calling anyway? For me there's not much that i can really think of. It's clear that the cons outweigh the pros, so why even take the risk. Not only is it a risk to your life buts it's also a risk to your pocket and can be hazardous to other people. In con conclusion to my research i truly believe that texting and driving or doing anything on your phone is definitely unacceptable in modern life.
