Dear,Pricipal please do not change the school policy . I believe we all as students deserve to have an opportunity to play sports . If we are not able to play sports allot of people are going to drop out of school just because they wont be able to play any sport .If we do something wrong there should be consequences for our actions not take the schools policy and not let us perform in any sport .I just think that's wrong .I'm hoping u can not change the school's policy and just give us silent lunch or no recess but, just taking our sports activities is just not right .I didn't come to this school to just sit around and not play in any of the schools activities .I just wish u can change this all up and drop down your pencil and pen and just call it a day .I wonder if you know how this all effects us .I mean if you where us students maybe u would wonder how we feel .Have u ever had to just think about it .i just wish you knew how we all feel . You already told us that if we didn't have good grades we couldn't participate in any other sports activities so why does it make it any different now. Please don't take our spots activities away just think about it please!

hopefully we are able to pay any sport avaliable
