Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing to respond to the idea of a policy that athletes must maintain a B average to play sports.

I am in agreement with you for the most part.

However, I do have a few suggestions.

As I mentioned before, I believe that your proposed policy is reasonable and should be implemented.

It is right to expect that students maintain a B average.

We, the students, should be held responsible for our decisions.

This policy would require more effort by part of students, which I feel is appropriate.

This makes sense because our creed if you will, VISA (value respect, include everyone, serve others, and accept responsibility) has as part of it, accept responsibility.

That said, I do propose that we give added support these students, a tutoring program.

If we add a tutoring program they are more likely to succeed.

While we do have Jumpstart, the students who go are required to go there and the others who may still need help are left out.

If this new tutoring program requires some time to set up, I would ask that you put the policy into affect next year, so that we may set up this program.

If we require higher standards we should encourage and help our students to achieve them, not set them up to fail.

In conclusion, I believe that we should have this B average policy, but that we should add a means of support.

I appreciate your time and interest in student opinion.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
