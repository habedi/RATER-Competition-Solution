In the Story "Unmasking the Face on Mars." The face on mars has apparently been founded in 1976, NASA claimed the the face was formed by a alien, Here is were I come in, The world had made a bunch of movies including aliens from mars, Mars, for hundreds maybe thousands of years have been the 'Aliens home'. Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution.

That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.

huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. huge rock formation...." It basically says that the rock is a formation ".......giving the illusion......" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth. I clearly gives out that opinion that if you put it together you get "A huge rock formations giving the illusion........." and so on.

I also think that The 'face' Is just a rock the looks like a face, clearly I stated that. Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ..."over time it transformed ....." in the text... "Huge rock FORMation." It is just a rock thats looks like a face, and just because it's on mars don't mean a thing.
