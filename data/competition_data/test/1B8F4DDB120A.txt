Dear principal

There are many students that have only a C average, many of witch are great at sports. A C average is good inofe to pass the grade, should it also be inofe for participation in sports activities. You know not every one has the potential to get a B average in all your classes. If you pass this policy I garenty that any sports team will not benefit. If anything it will be extremely bad for any team. Some students struggle just to get a C average. If you pass this policy at least have the team will not meet the stander. This will shorten are chances of wining a game. A C average is perfect most of the kids in our school have a C average. Some students consider a C great. Some are just happy there passing. Like i said not smart inof to get B average. I can not stress that last statement inof. I don't think that because were passing with a C witch is average, we should not be aloud to play any sports. There is a lot of reasons why I don't like this idea. If this some sort of plan to get us to do better in school, than let me tell you there are a hole lot more ways to motivate us. I think that this little policy of yours kind of, well lets not go there.
