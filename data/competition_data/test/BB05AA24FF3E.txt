Dear principle,

I have been informed that you are reconsidering the cell phone policy at this school.

The two choices I have heard are: one, let the students keep phones, and use them, only during lunch and other free periods/times during the day, or: two, not let the students have phones in school at all.

Well, let me tell you this now.

The second idea is a horrible one.

I, and all of the school students feel very strongly on being able to use our phones in school.

Because of the need of phones in case of emergencies, it will make it less hectic and cluttered when a fire breaks out or something else of that manner happens.

In case you are wondering what i mean by, "hectic and cluttered," I will describe it to you.

First of all this school only has one phone, and it is in the office, which isn't very big.

Due to the use of only one phone, there will be too long of a line/wait to use this phone, and this may pose as a risk to the safety of the students.

So , if we can carry our cell phones around, there will be much less clutter in the office, thus posing ,less of a threat to us students.

Also, when I say hectic, I am saying that when disaster or an emergency does break out, people will be less calm, and more panic stricken than anything.

The students will run and fight to get to the one phone in the office to call home, so when we can use our phones to call home, less people will get hurt trying to get to the phone and less of a threat the long line/wait in the office to get to the phone will be.

We do understand that we can only use our phones during our free time and in dire emergencies.

We also understand that we must have them off at all times during class.

So, because of that, we have conjured up an agreement.

Well, more of a rule than an agreement.

We will follow all of the rules pertaining to the use of phones, and if we don't, than you can do what you want to the school's phone policy.

As stated in the first paragraph of this letter the students and I are all aware of the decision you have to make.

Keep phones, or get rid of them.

We hope that you will understand where we are coming from on this idea, and will let us keep our cell phones for emergencies and for during our free time at school.

Thank you and have a nice day.
