I do not agree with the principal when he says that all students should have to do extra curricular activities, because all students should have a chance to do what they want, and not be forced to do something that they might not like to do. Some students have a sport or some thing important after school that extra curricular activities might get in the way of. Also some students might not like to do things after school. Some parents do not like when their kids do things after school and would rather tell them they have to come right home after school, because it might be in the way of a important meeting they have to go to. I think students should do extra curricular activities if they choose to, but I do not think they should be forced to do something, especially if they do not like the thing they are being forced to do. But I do think that if students are just sitting on the couch playing on their phones after school, then they should have to do something like an extra curricular activity unless they do not like it, then they should do something that they like, but if they do not like it then they should not have to do it. I also think they should add an extra curricular activity that would be more calming, like yoga or just a class on something thats calm, or on how to calm yourself in a stressful situation. i also think there should be a after school club where you can just talk or play board games or card games with your friends in the cafeteria or gym, or even in a section of the halls, if thats allowed because that would make it more likely that more students will show up after school to do things with their friends. It would also be a good way of making more friends, and to improve social skills, and help some students with stage fright if they have it, and that would help with talking in front of a big audience, so they can be more comfortable presenting bigger projects in front ofÂ bigger groups.
