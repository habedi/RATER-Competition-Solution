Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly disagree with the idea of changing the eligibility policy from a grade C average to a grade B average. I do agree that children participating in extra curricular activities should have good grades, but expecting a B from everyone is unreasonable. If you carry out this policy the number of children participating in these activities will be slim to none. If you want to lose these programs then change it, but if not I advise you to leave it alone.

Many of my friend on the basketball team have learning problems, like dyslexia, but are amazing athletes. Others try their hardest to have better grades ,but just can't keep them up.

Look at as a worst case scenario. You change the policy, and we don't make the grades. We don't get to participate in the activities, so we stop trying to have good grades. We stop having good grades and don't pay attention to what is being taught. Therefore, we don't test well, and you know that the state tests help fund our school. If we don't do well, we stop getting funding. Then the school loses money and soon will be forced to shut down.

Don't you think that leaving the policy alone would benefit us all.

sincerely,
