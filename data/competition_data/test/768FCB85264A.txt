Is it aliens or is it a natural landform? About twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, and was taking photographs. As Viking 1 was taking photos, there was one certain photo that caught NASA's eye. A photo the seemed to look like a face. NASA believes it was an alien artifact, but it really is just a natural landform. Mars' "face" is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.

Thoughout the years that the "face" of Mars was known, there is a change of the landform. Looking at the pictures of 1976, 1998, and 2001 the landform changes. By the time of 1998 the landform has more cracks in it. On April 5, 1998 thousands of people on the web were waiting to see another picture of the land on Mars. The people were not satisfied and said it was not fair. They complained and said it was the cloudiest time of the year for the Red Planet. Yes, they realized that Mars also has wheather. The most common is the sand storms it has. The wind and sand that moves around will change that landform of the surface. The land of Mars will breakdown into even more sand. Like most planets, the land will change by its wheather. The land is caused by natural causes of wheather, not by aliens.

The "face" of Mars is caused by natural causes. It is caused by the wheather. Thoughout the years the land and its figure changes. Mars' face is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.
