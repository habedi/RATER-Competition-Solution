Ok, well Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy and he got to see many intresting sites when on the job. The artical states that Luke got to see what it is like to be in those countreys. But yet, in the end on their way back they did have lots of fun playing many games on ship.

The first reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because you get to help other people, animals, supplies, and you get to feel what its like to be in that place. And you do get to see some pretty amazing sites. You do get to go over sea, and you will be with other people so you won't be lonly. And you can be under 18 to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

The second reason you should join is because you will not be lonly, you will have friends there, also you can get friend or family to join if you want. you also can play games on your way back. And it is the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) who are hiring you to work for them. And yet why wouldn't you want to join, it is a one in a lifetime opportunity.

Some people say that you should not join reasons why, well frist off they that you can be killed which is true but yet very low chance of that happinging. They also say that its not worth it and that all that stuff is going to be gone anyway but yet before you can lose the supplies why not use them to help. And they say that you can end up bringing crimanals but yet the Seagiong Cowboys would most likly will bring criminals to safe places but yet make sure that they don't hurt anyone.

In concusion you should join because you get to help people and animals, you get to see amazing sites, you get to have fun, and you do not have to be lonly when working for them.
