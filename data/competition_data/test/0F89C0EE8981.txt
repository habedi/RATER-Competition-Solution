Dear, Principle

Your rules in our school is that we cant use any cell phone at all. All students need to use their cell phone just in case of an emergency. You should really allow that to happen because it is unfair to us that we cant use them and i will tell you why. At least let us use it during free periods.

We should be allowed to use our cell phones because what if we have an emergency at home but we wont me able to find out until we go home to know something had happened to our family. We that's very impossible for us.

Kids can't live without their phones and we can keep track with our work because we wont b bored doing all work and no taking breaks. At least let us have a break because that isn't fair for us that we have to sit in the class all day until school is over. We need this opportunity to have a fun day in school and learn at the same time.

As you can see, my point of view is to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The reason being is because its out free time to play but we don't have enough fun because we would like to talk on our phones and text people you miss talking to. Its just not fair.

Sincerely,
