I think students should have to perform community service. A reason I think students should perform community service is because they can get a chance to help in a way. When students do community service they might be making a difference in someone else's life. For instance, help feeding the hungry will have them not hungry at least for that one day. That might make that person do something good that day.

Students should want to do community service. I think students should want to do community service it helps them on their college application. For instance, if I put in a college application and I had a lot community service time and my major was working with people, they may give me a scholarship. The college will see that I like working with people and you enjoy do it. So students probably would want to do community service it will help them when they are applying for college.

Students should be required to do community service because it's a way to help others. If you do community service they will have soup kitchens and things where you can learn to help others. I think if students learn to help others early they will do it when they get older. For example, if someone never help someone when they young, they certainly won't when they get older. So I think students should be required to do community service while they are young.
