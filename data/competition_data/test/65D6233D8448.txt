dear principal my name is STUDENT_NAME and i think that every body should do community service because we can help other people with their chores and some kids think that community service is just a waste of time but is not community service is about helping other people and my friend got community service because he got in a fight at school and he went to court and the judge gave him 30hours of community service and the next day he staid after school to help the janitor clean all the mess in the auditorium, gym classrooms and the hallways and they even went at the back of the school to pick up all the cheetos bags that were left outside when we have recess and he did all that in just 2 hours and the next day he did the same thing but it was tufter because there was more trash to pick up and it took 4 hours to pick that trash up and that's why i think community service is important. and if i was a person in need i would like some body to help me and helping people is important and it would be helpful to help somebody in need and middle school students think that's boring but elementary kids community service is fun and its good to help somebody
