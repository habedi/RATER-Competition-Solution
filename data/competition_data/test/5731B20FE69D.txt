Most teenagers are eager to get their license, but with the amount of cars being bought and used declining, it seems as if most don't mind not being able to drive. While it may be extrememly hard to not own a car in our society, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

Pollution has always been an issue in our world, mostly because of cars. Diesel fuel was blamed for "near-record pollution" in Paris, and driving was banned to clear the air. Because cars cause so much pollution that it forces us to ban them, it is therefore causing us to slow the buying on them. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below where they were in January of 1995. This may be because most Americans cannot afford a car these days, but not owning a car will definitely not burn a hole in our wallets.

Not only are cars consuming of our space (with a car comes a garage), they are comsuming of our money as well. Gas prices have been and are currently rising, which makes it very difficult for some car-owners to pay for other important necessities in their lives, such as children.

Limiting car usage has also made an impact on some people's mood. In Vauban, Germany, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and it has been more than beneficial. Media trainer and mother of two Heidrun Walter says "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." For example, you might have had a bad day, or are upset about something and are driving home from work. Your anger channels into your driving and causes an accident. This all could have been avoided if we cracked down on the usage of cars.

Overall, cars have been very beneficial for our society, but we get even more benefits if we stop using them. Pollution can be reduced, money can stay in our bank accounts, and moods can be positively changed if we stop using cars.
