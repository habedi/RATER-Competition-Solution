Hello my name is Luke Bomberger and I was seagoing cowboy after World War II. I helped transfer animals to Europe and Asia .It was after the war ,"and many countries were left in ruins".(paragraph 2).I enjoyed it a lot because I got to go see other parts of the world.

I would recomend this job for anyone who likes to adventure. This job is full of fun and exploration. It takes a lot of wateing because "it takes about two weeks to cross the Alantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United states and a month to get to china".(paragraph 6).Theres also a lot of running around and getting the animals fed. When your waiting for the animals to fed you can have a lot of fun like playing table-tenis,vollyball,boxing which will pass the time. This program done be dangerous at times because there might be a storm or a hauracane. I acually broke my ribs trying to get across the Alantic. though it does pay out in the end.

I would totally recomend this program to anyone. We talked how it was good. It can be dangerous. Though you get to go to places you never thought you would go. In the end your doing this for a good cause.
