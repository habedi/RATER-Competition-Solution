Twently five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the plannet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2 when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a regions red planet called Cydonia.

The face of mars is an all natural landform Its a huge rock formation which resembles a human head ... formed by shawdow giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth. The face of mars is a natural landform there was no alien monument after all.

Research shows The Face of mars is a natural landform there was no alien monument. As said is research what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - Landforms common around the American West. ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.'' Thats a lava dome that takes the of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars .

As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size , so if there was more to it than the fact its just the Face of mars . If there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Pryamids or even small shakes you would be able to see what they were .
