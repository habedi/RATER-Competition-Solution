Should we study venus or throw away the idea because all the dangers? Venus is the closest planet to Earth. Therefore if anything happened to Earth we would have to move to our "twin" Planet. Even though Venus has the hottest surface temperature out of all the planets and we humans wouldn't last a second on the planet. Scientist are finding ways to study the planet and see if we possibly could create life there.

"many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus". The author includes ways, like this, to prove how and why we should get knowledge about Venus. He includes in paragraph 5 about NASA and their ideas for sending humans to study the planet. "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"

There are many reasons to why we souldn't study Venus and get close to the planet, but there are also enough reaons to why we should. Something could happen to Earth and we humans have no way to leave and restart everything that we built on earth because we have no where to go. If scientist study Venus and find ways for us to live on the planet, then we have a back up plan. " Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limted by dangers and doubts but should be expanded too meet the very edges of imagination and innovation".
