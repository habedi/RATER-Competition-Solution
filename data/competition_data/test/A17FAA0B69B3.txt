The author supports this idea well because they give alot infromation, and deatils about Venus, and how venus is the second planet from our sun. The author suggest to study Venus because is important to know about it and how it's bad or good. Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. The mission was unmanned, and for a good reason because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hour. This why venus could be dangerous because not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. I choose this evidence because expalins alot about venus, and how spacescraft don't want to go down their because no one survived the landing, and how Venus could be dangerous. First, it talks about how Venus,and Mars our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Then it talks about 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus even more challenging are the clous of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere and the planet surface, temparatures avarage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.
