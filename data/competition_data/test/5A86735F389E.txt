I think that the Electoral College vote is important because it is the government officals who make up that vote. They have experiece with governent matters so they could have better judgement than the majority population.

Now that statement it not one hundred percent accurate but I would guess that the people running the country would hopefully have a decent idea for who should run everything. Now this doesn't mean that everyone in higher power is smart and knows what choices to make. Some would argue that none of them have any idea what they're doing. I have slightly more faith then those folks. I think the Electoral vote is important, just not as important as it currently is. I think the Electoral college vote counts but I do agree that it shouldn't be the most important group of vouters. Voting should be by the people for the people. So the majority vote should be the primary source.

In conclusion I believe that the Electoral College vote is important but not as important as the majority population vote.
