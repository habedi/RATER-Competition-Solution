Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would be able to benefit from attending their classes from home because they could have fallen ill from a sickness that would generally prevent them from attending school, the student or students could have extreme anxiety issues to where they could faint after an anxiety attack from being overwhelmed by the abundance of people around them, and they would not miss any important information that will benefit them as well as their education.

First of all, like any school would, they encourage their students that if they are sick or not feeling as well as they should be, they are to stay home so they won't get sick others and most importantly to get rest. While they are out of school, they are missing class time. This class time could be very essential to them because, in class, the class could be going over some information that would be needed to pass a test. With this being said, the opportunity of being able to attend class from would benefit the students if they are sick should be given so the students would not miss out on test given information.

Second of all, Students with anxiety issues can get overwhelmed by the abundance of students and teachers around them. Them getting overwhelmed could cause them to have an anxiety attack and cause them to faint from it. By having access to being able to attend school from home, a student fainting from an anxiety attack would be prevented from happening.

Third of all, what if a student has important information from their instructor about something that is upcoming in their class? The student would not be able to get the information that could benefit them because for some reason they would not be able to attend school. If their school adopted a distance learning program, they would not miss the opportunity of gathering this important information from their instructor because they have the opportunity of being able to attend class from home.

In conclusion, schools offering distance learn would benefit every student attending school because a student could be sick and staying home would mean they would be missing class time, students could have bad anxiety and would get overwhelmed while at school because of the large amount of people, and if a student is unable to attend school for a specific reason, they could miss some important information that their instructor needs to give them that could benefit them and their education. While most would be in favor of this idea, other may find that distance learning by way of online or video conferencing could detach students for from society, the students won't be able to participate in essential hands on activity, and won't get the overall full school experience. This rebut to the distance learning program should not deter any school board official or any person from being in favor of this beneficial tool for enhancing the opportunity of learning. All in all, every school should invest in a distance learning program for their students, for it will benefit the school and most of all the students.
