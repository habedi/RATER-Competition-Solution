Dear Principal,

I would like to take a position in doing community service . I think everyone should help out to make this a better world and it will stop some students from littering and doing stuff that make our community look so bad. In my opinion I think since students decide to litter and not have a problem with it then , I think they shouldn't have a problem with helping to clean it up . Then again some students have things to do like sports or maybe even baby-sit.

Next , I think it is nice for some students to be involved in tutoring elementary students . It is a fun experience and will make me feel good about myself . But , some students at this school aren't really good role models for the elementary kids . So I disagree with every students being forced to do this . For example : some students do drugs or are involved in gangs , say a lot of profanity , and "sag". Most of the elementary kids look up to us and if they see older kids doing that they would probably think it is appropriate and cool so they would want to do it .

Finally , I think us students should help out on serving lunch every now and then . I use to do that in my elementary school and I had fun doing it . It is fun to experience and I appreciated the lunch workers more . Maybe sweeping up the gym , the blacktop, and the cafeteria every now and then would be okay .

Sincerely,
