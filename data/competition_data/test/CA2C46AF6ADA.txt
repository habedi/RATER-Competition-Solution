Dear TEACHER_NAME,

March 2,2011

I was thinking that community service is very important to our society. Since we are in a Catholic school I think it would be a good idea to give back to our society. I am someone that enjoys volunteering because it leaves me with an accomplishment and just a good feeling for helping others.

People that volunteer get a couple good things out of it. First of all you get to help others and it might just be the smallest thing that you do to help people. One easy thing that would be very helpful is to help out a younger grade teachers for about a hour and just help the students read or write or anything that the teacher would need help with. It doesn't have to be hard labor just something to give back to the community.

Another way to help the community is to just pick up trash that isn't yours. I know that for some people it might be totally disgusting to pick up a piece of paper found on the floor but you don't want the whole world to be filled with trash. So I think just simple things could make the world a better place.

With wanting to make the world a better place I think that community service should be required for school. I also think it would look good on our permanent record for collage and high school.

I don't want to make it back breaking labor but, maybe just something to make a difference in my life and others. I know it might sound crazy because i am just in 8th grade but even the smallest person can make a difference in life even if its just picking up a piece of paper. That small piece of paper could have saved us from polluting our world.
