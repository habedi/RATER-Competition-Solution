People show emotions everyday whethter it's happy, sad, angry, excited, afriad, or confused. Expressions give off hints of the type of mood people are in. If you are frowning then you are angry or sad. If you were to be smiling you would be excited or happy. People love showing expression to a lot of things and we can be able to recognize it just by looking at them.

Sometimes you just can't seem to understand someone's expression. A lot of times you won't be able to understand what is going on with someone. Sometimes the answer is within the person's facial muscles You could try asking if they are okay, but their facial expression might be a truthful answer.

According paragraph 8, "...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a

"smiling" polotician or celebrity isn't being truthful". This quote means that just because someone is smiling doesn't means that it is thier true feelings.

Luckily for everyone around the world it is about to change. Technology is a humongous part of our lives right? Well scientists have created a machine allowing people to know the true emotions of another person. That means that if students and adults are faking a happy smile, this machine will detect the truth. This device is called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Just how does this machine works? According to paragraph 3, " The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles". This means that by using all 44 of the muscles in our face can determine our mood.

Nowadays teens are the main one with emotion issues. We can't tell whether they are angry or not. This machine will be able to tell us how students feel. Typically students are in a mood in which the really don't care about anything. We will eventually be able to tell what's really going on in their minds. Machines like this can change the way we see others and be able tounderstand them more.
