Driving a car around can be very a affective aspect in people's lives; it can also be a very stressful and dangerous life-risking task to do each and every day. All across America, citizens are constantly driving their cars. A car can be used to go to work, to the grocery store, or to drop a loved one off to school and even other places. It is to the point were a simple car has become an important necessity to manage everyday life. It is also to a point at which every year cars are responsible for thousands of deaths and accidents. If people around the world limited their car usuage everyday it could significantly better our lives.

Clear the air. Pollution from cars has serverely polluted the air we breathe and our enviornment. Beijing, China is know as one of the most polluted cities in the world and has been effected my the smog. Many places around the world are trying to make a difference in their envoirnment by trying to get citizens in that area to limit their driving. According to an excerpt from "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, Paris has enforced a parital driving ban to help clean the air of the global city. As stated in the excerpt, "On Monday motorist with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day." Just because of that one action congestion in the capital of France was down 60 percent and as time goes by the air will start to clear up faster.

If one had the opportunity to take away stress while lower the air pollution, would the do it? In Bogota, Colombia once a year millions of Columbians take part in a day without cars know as car-free day. As stated the the article, "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota," by Andrew Selsky the goal of the car-free day is to promote alternative transportaion and reduce smog. Many citizens of Colombia take advantage of the day by hiking, biking, skating or taking buses to work, which benefits one's health and is a great source of excersize. Because of this day many parks and sports centers have opened, sidewalks have been replaced, and rush-hour restrictions have created a better flow in traffic.

Putting away something you constantly use everyday can be a difficult thing to do but it is worth it in the end. Minimizing the use of cars can greatly reduce the amount of polluion of the air. If we all comply with is task year by year our air will get cleaner and the enviornment will be better.
