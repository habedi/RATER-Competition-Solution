I think you should choose policy one because the student aren't going to like it and cause problems until you change the rules. The kids will try to act cool until they could use them by bringing it any way and hiding in class and other places. They might go to there grandparents when they get off the bus and if someone needs a phone you got to be able to call someone. As long as they don't have them in class then i think they should be fine also not interrupting other students. But if they want to talk to someone or text friends across the room then its better than yelling at each other.

I also think they should be able to have them during there free times during It day and through periods. If they have all there homework done and you have nothing to do you should be aloud to text people. They should have there volume off and not vibrate that way it wont disrupt anyone while there trying to work. If you see a student that has one in class then take it and don't give it back until the end of the year unless thy do community service for a long amount of time and work hard while doing it.

You shouldn't do reason two because they might be the only one home when they get off the bus and if something happens then there lost. if the bus breaks down and the bus drivers is dead then they wont be able to call no-one and they'll be stranded for a long time. something might have happened to their parents and if someone tries to call them they wont get through and something bad could happen. The only way id do option two is if they completely ignore option one. That's when i would do policy to but no other way would you do that.
