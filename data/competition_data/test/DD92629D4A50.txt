Dear Principal,

Kids love their phones. in fact they love it so much that they think their life's practically revolve around their phones.

For this reason, I believe that you should not allow kids to have phones at school at all. My reason for saying so is because, some kids are disobedient and they do not listen to rules, hence "turn off during class time". Also, phones causes distractions, and lastly because phones can also lead to violence. For these very reasons phones should be banned from all schools.

I believe phones shouldn't be allowed in school because kids are disobedient and don't listen to rules. Although, in Policy 1 it states "use them during lunch and free periods as long as phones are turned off during class time" I believe that students will take advantage of the situation and continue to use their phones during class time. If my school allowed me to use my phone during school I wouldn't turn my phone off just because a lesson is going on. I would continue to text my friend or whom ever it may be that I am texting and while I am doing so, I would be losing learning time and missing important information that I will need in the future, which brings me to my next point:

Phones are big distractions for students and teachers as well. Allowing students to bring phones to school for them, basically gives them the opportunity to use their phones whenever they want to and they miss out on class work and notes, which might eventually lead to failure and decreasing of the students grades. When someone calls or texts a phone the hone makes noise whether it is vibrations or loud ring tones. These ring tones and vibrations appear as distractions for their peers so not only does it effect just that one student but the whole class as well. In my opinion, if you allow students to bring phones to school, their grades, and participation grades will decrease, because all focus will be gone, and more students will fail or even have to got to summer school. All because of a device that they were allowed to bring to school.

My last reason that phones shouldn't be allowed in schools is because phones can link to violence. For instant, not all people have nice phones, or even phones at all, because of this students phones might get stolen, or misplaced. If the student was ever to find out to whom took the phone he/she might get into an altercation with the other person, which ,may eventually lead to fighting and violence. I believe that students are v=better off just leaving their phones at home and texting and/or calling their "bff's" after school.

Inconclusive, I believe that phoebes should not be allowed at school, therefore, I am asking that you pick Policy 2. the reason I believe that phones shouldn't be allowed in school is because: kids don't always follow the rules, phones are a big distraction, and last phones can link to violence. I feel that phones are better left off at home for every bodies sake!
