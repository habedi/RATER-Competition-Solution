Dear principal,

I strongly agree that students should take a position in community service. I agree because everyone should want to live in a safe environment and if we don't stand up and clean up our communities who will.

I don't only think that students should do community service but adults should also. Another reason why we should perform community service is because it may be your little brother or sister that may need tutoring . For those of you who don't think you should participate in these services your wrong.

Community services are not just time consuming, it serves its purpose.

It isn't like your doing it just to be doing it, your actually helping someone. I know that the person appreciates what your doing because your taking your time to help the and that shows a lot.

These are my reasons why people should enjoy and take some time out of their day to help someone because one day you may need help and the person you said no to might turn out to be the person that helps you.

sincerely

STUDENT_NAME, ps. someone who cares.
