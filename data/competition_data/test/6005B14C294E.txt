Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Quite a few schools require students to complete summer projects so they can continue learning even during their breaks. Many people have different opinions on whether it should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Personally, a summer project that is designed by a teacher would be helpful. I believe the summer project should be teacher-designed since it's more difficult and provides better resources.

If the students' summer projects were to be designed by teachers, the difficulty would definitely increase. It may sound like a bad thing for students, but it would help them gain more knowledge; specifically on the topics the students had received for their project. The harder the project is, the more knowledge you gain. Students should challenge themselves with harder projects in order to sharpen their mind more. The difficulty level will surely help everyone prepare for future works and projects. An academic challenge is needed whether one wants it or not. A student-designed summer project wouldn't exactly be helpful in that case.

Teacher-designed summer projects seemingly provides better resources for students since it's more advanced. The projects would surely have better quality and higher difficulty. If it were to be student-designed, it wouldn't be as advanced as the teacher-designed project. The better the resources are, the more information you get. Teachers do put their heart and time into using resources in order to make a great project for students' to improve their skills and help them learn more. Personally, it's always great to have a teacher-designed work since it's a huge help to tons of people. They would provide better resources than student-designed after all.

Others may counter back that the student-designed summer projects would be better since it would be easier on students and will still help them learn more. The counter back statement brings out a good valid point, however, it wouldn't be a challenge for students. Projects that are student-designed would still help, but not as much as teacher-designed ones. I believe many students would agree that teachers creates harder work and projects. The difficulty may be high, but it would definitely help the student learn more through hard work. Harder work means more information and knowledge. If the summer projects were to be easier, students would complete it fast and might not learn much from it. Therefore, the summer projects should be teacher-designed.

The stated question on whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed has a clear answer by now. The answer being that the projects are better off as teacher-designed. Schools should have teacher-designed projects since they are more difficult and provides better resources which are helpful in getting students to learn more and better. Students surely would be upset that the projects are not easier since it would make them struggle. Easier projects sounds nice, but they aren't as useful as harder projects. I believe one gains more knowledge and skills from a tough challenge. It will highly prove to become helpful in the future. In conclusion, summer projects designed by teachers are the better option.
