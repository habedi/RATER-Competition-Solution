Distance school learning

Disatance learning is a great option for students to attend school from home. It's helpful and also it makes it much easier for the students to learn online classes or video conferencing from thier homes using computer or any technology that they can use o help them with thier classes that they will be taking.

Yes I do think attending classes from home will benefit students to learn . Even though not all people has the same opinion and will not agree with me in this case that it will benefit students attending classes from home online.

According on taking online classes students would be able to go to a peaceful and quiet place to work on thier school assignments. Without having other kids distrubting them from doing school work. They don't got to deal with noises of others, becuase they will be in a spot where they can focus and be able to learn much better without having someting that can stop them finishing the work that has to be done.

Students has all the time they want to work on a topic. Being able to use as many time they think they need without having a teacher telling them how much time they have left to be done on assignments, to move on to other works that has to be done. They don't got to rush on anything and having thier heads in many places, just because they got an certain time they got to be done on a topic that has to be done with. For an example they can move to other topics at anytime they want and at any speed they will like with no worries on not finishing a work they are not able to understand.

They as a students has technology that can be use to do all assignments: computters, tablets, phones, or others ects that can helpout. All thier stuffs will can be save in one place instead having lots and lots of paper all over the place, and not being organized which some students are not organized with thier personal school works. If they need help they have google they can use and it could be helpful to search up any information they need to assces or use it for any casses they would like to. Students can as well contact friends to communicate with and having the opportunity helping each other out in online.

It's a great option having some schools that allows students to attend school onine. Not all schools has the opportunity to give students the chance rather to attend school online or not, if i had the chance I will love to take the chance to attend school from home.
