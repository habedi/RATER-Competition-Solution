Dear Principal,

Of course kids want to have their cell phones all day during school. I think that you should not let us have our cell phones during lunch and free periods because many kids will take advantage of that and use their phone all throughout the day. During lunch some kids finish their homework.

If they are texting they will get so caught up in that they wont finish their homework. That can effect their grades a lot. Many girls wear tight pants to school. That means that their pockets are too tight to fight much in them. Putting your cell phone in their can make it turn on and if your parents need to tell you they wont be home after school or your teacher emailed me and you need to star staying after it will ring during class and disrupt the class. Some kids are very sneaky and do text all throughout the day. Being allowed to have their phone at certain points in the day will make some kids think they wont get in trouble no matter when they use their phone. When kids are in the library they seem to think that is free time so they will text in the library disrupting other kids. When kids see other kids texting they always watch them causing them to not pay attention during class. When teachers turn their back to write on the board all the kids take advantage and take out their phones and text. Then put them away when the teacher turns around again. Most kids text other kids in the class. If the teacher catches one of you she can see who you are texting and you will get caught too. Even if you are texting someone in another class. Walking from class to class is free time. If you are texting in the hallways and you get too into the text message conversation you will be late to your classes and get in trouble. If you are not aloud to have your phone with you then you can't say to the teacher sorry I was texting that will get you in even more trouble. Also if you walk to school you cant say to your teacher I was late because I was texting. When you are doing your homework during class and you get distracted by texting someone you will do your homework all wrong. During class the next day if you are still texting you may not pay attention when you are going over the homework and when it comes time to study for a test you will be studying the wrong information. That will really affect your grade on a test. When you have study hall that is considered free time you will be able to text, when you should really be studying or doing home work. That will really affect you're grade. Texting during class and having your phone set on the volume high will disrupt the class and by the time the teacher figures out whose phone it was you have wasted ten minutes of class time because no one admits it was them. Texting should not be allowed during school at all.
