Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Here at school is supposed to be a fun place for us but, most of the time it isn't. Students have things to look forward to for example the sports they either like or love to play. If most students in our school have C' s than making then have a B average would upset them terribly. I am a student that loves to play sports but sometimes I do get a C on my report card and progress reports. I get that you are just trying to help us and work harder but, i just isn't fair to most of the students that go here. I think it should be good enough for you that they do try their best and sometimes it works out but sometimes it just doesn't work. If that is good enough for me that should be good enough for you.

If you end up changing the school policy for sports then won't the parents complain about it too? They would be mad. Also, won't the students be discouraged too? Why don't you ask yourself" What would i feel like if I liked to play a sport but got some C' s?"

Wouldn't you feel discouraged because the sport that you love to play is gone for you and you couldn't play for the school team? Well I would because I love to play basketball and softball and if I couldn't play those sports just because I got a C on my report card i would be devastated. Why take the fun out of these kids' lives? Just let them play the sport that they love with a C or higher so they can be happy. TEACHER_NAME please to not change this rule I think a lot of students would agree with me and as a school we could all be providential.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
