When thinking about technology in school, what comes to mind? To me, projectors, computers, and tablets. But soon, we may be getting something that too personal and shouldn't be used for education purposes. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a an algorithm that can recognize facial features of a human being.

Why wouldn't the emotinal expressions of a student be valuable? Well, it's too personal. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" Having a camera that can detect every one of your emotions while doing assainments on computers seems a little above and beyound, especially when you're just concentrating and maybe your facial features aren't really saying what your mind is.

"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" It only reads facial expressions, there's no information on why or what's making the student not enjoy whatever the student is doing, you dont know what going on in their head. Why have information only on the students expression when there's no reasoning behind it?

As I read more and more on the FACS, I continue to doubt it, it's too in your face about everything, and having something monitor you every day of school, which is already stressful mind you, just adds more into the mix.
