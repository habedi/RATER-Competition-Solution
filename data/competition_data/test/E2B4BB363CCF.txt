At some schools summer projects are a requirement for students to complete during the break. These projects are assigned for students to continue learning over the summer break. Not only do these projects help students learn new content, but it helps the students retain the information they have learned prior to the break. These breaks are fairly lengthy and without some work between each school year it is often difficult to retain the information that the students have learned. Many of these projects are teacher-designed, and the thought of student-designed projects are a possibility. Student-designed projects may sound great to students, but this would ultimately be ineffective when it comes to student progression. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it would be more organized, more effective, and more efficient.

Although some may say that student-designed projects would lead to less stress, teacher-designed projects take away the stress of creating the project. Students will have to think and create a project for themselves to do over the summer with student-designed projects. This adds another step for the students to go through in order to complete their work. Some students are not as creative as others, and they might struggle to think of an idea for their project. Some students may stress over if what they completed is acceptable and adequate. Students would not have to stress over the creation of their projects if they were just given guidelines to follow by their teachers. Teachers distress the projects by taking away tasks that the students would need to complete to finish their assignments. Students having to create their projects adds a whole level of stress to the project that would not be there if the teachers had designed the projects for the students.

Teacher-designed projects would be more organized than student-designed projects. Teachers can create organized projects with many details to the project due to them already doing that during the school year. Teachers create projects and assignments throughoutÂ the school year, so they are good at creating guidelines and rubrics on which they are scored upon. Teachers are able to organized the fine details of the project such as what it is on, what it should be formatted like, and what it will graded on. Teachers can organize assignments better than students because it is their jobs to do so in order for students to learn. Teachers are the best suited in order to make projects organized.

Teacher-designed projects would be more effective than student designed projects. The projects created by teachers are based on material that the students have learned or will learn in the future. Students should not know the material that they will learn in the future, so the teachers creating the material for the students would be effective for them to learn. The teachers know the content the students will learn, so making the students create the assignments would be absurd. Teachers know how to create projects that will help students understand the material because they know how students learn. Giving students the task of creating a project will be based on prior knowledge and not what they will learn: this is just memory retention rather than learning.

Teacher-designed projects would be more efficient than student-designed. Students creating a project for themselves to do will take up more time than if the teacher were to assign an project for the majority of students. This takes away the time from the students' vacations and time to create the project. The teachers would make the experience much less time consuming for both the students and the teacher. The students would spend less time designing the project, and the teachers would spend less time going through each project idea. Teachers would efficiently grading through the projects due to them being based on the same assignment.

Teachers would be the best option to design projects for the students to do over summer break. Teachers would create a less stressful project overall for the students because they would have to spend less time on creating an idea for the project. The teachers are better at organizing big assignments and projects such as a summer project. Teachers know the material that students will learn making teacher-designed projects more effective for student learning. Teachers will create a time effective and efficient projects not only to complete, but to grade as well. Teacher-designed projects are more beneficial to the student for learning over the break than student-designed projects and should be the preferred method of project design for all schools that require summer projects.
