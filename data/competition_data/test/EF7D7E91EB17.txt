Schools often assign summer projects to students to expand their learning during their summer break.

It is often believed that teachers should assign these projects to follow the certain curriculum they must teach, but I have to disagree with that statement.

Students should be able to enjoy their summer break without having to worry about several assignments that they must finish before school starts again.

The teachers could assign a project that is very stressful, long, and not easy to do without help from a teacher, which could ruin a person's break from the already stressful environment.

In my opinion, students should be able to design these projects to, ultimately, benefit from the assignment more than one that is just a burden to them.

Most students work at different speeds and are usually on different levels of their school work.

Some students may be on a higher level of certain types of the curriculum, while the others are on a much lower level.

If teachers were to assign these summer projects, they would choose an average project, when there are others who need a lower or higher level project.

If students were able to design these projects, they could use it to their benefit.

The students who are on a higher level can challenge themselves even more by choosing a harder topic, while the ones who are on a lower level can choose a topic that would be considered average, but could possibly be a vigorous challenge to them.

When students are able to design the project, they can make it a more flexible project.

This could help them be able to still enjoy their summer without having the burden of doing a stressful and long project.

They could be able to do the project in a short time, or work on it for short amounts of time each day.

This way, they are able to complete the assignment, and still be able to have time to go on vacation, relax with friends, etc.

They will not work themselves continuously and are able to still have a break from the stress of school.

Most teachers believe they should assign the project for the students so they will come back to school on the same page, this may be a good idea in theory, but some students are not able to do the work assigned without the teacher's help.

If there is no school, those students are not able to receive help on the project and must rely on themselves.

This could help challenge the students, but if they did it wrong, the student comes back with the same knowledge they had before.

Some students could also not receive help from their guardians if they also do not know how to complete such assignments.

Without any help at all, the students could teach themselves a different way to do a project that might not be how to do so at all.

To prevent this occurrence, students could choose their own topic and be able to do it correctly without any trouble.

Students could also not have anything to look forward to if they have to still complete assignments over their break.

Normally, students look forward to their break from school, a time when they will not have to worry or stress about anything.

The only thing these students have to do over their break is have fun, but if the teacher assigns a long and stressful assignment, the students have to worry about it as well, making it harder to enjoy themselves.

If the students could pick the assignment, they could pick something that is interesting or intriguing to them, making it easier for them to enjoy having to do the assignment.

When students assign their summer projects, they will be able to work at their own speed, make it more flexible, able to complete it themselves without help, and have a summer break to look forward to.

Without this, some student may start to dislike school because they have to constantly work without even a summer break.

Students can, overall, enjoy their summer much more when they choose the assignment rather than the teacher choosing it.

If they were able to pick the topic, they could pick something that is interesting to them and may even find what they want to pursue a career in.

The possibilities of a good ending are endless.

Students can benefit much more with their own chosen topic and can even start to love the certain curriculum it was for.
