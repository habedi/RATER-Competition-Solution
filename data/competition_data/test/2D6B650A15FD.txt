dear, principal:_______

I think you have made an excellent choice for raising the average that students must have in order to play sports.

Although you have made it more challenging for the students to play a sport you are helping them in their educational lives.

The students should thank you because you have given them a better chance to get into a great college.

I say that because you have to have good grades for a college scout to even come out and watch you play.

It does not matter if you are the best athlete in the world if your failing colleges will not pick you.

Also if your a pretty good player but not exactly the best, but you have a great grades they will sign you.

Trust me you are making the students future and success in life better than it would have been if that student was just average.

sincerely,____________
