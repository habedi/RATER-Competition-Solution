Some schools require a summer project at the end of every school year. Summer projects help students maintain the information that was learned from the whole year, inside of students brains. They can also be used to get a head startÂ with information for the following year. Summer projects are more beneficial when they are teacher designed because teachers have more experience. Them having experience lets them know what important information to put into the project, and how to challenge the students with that information.

Although having a teacher design a summer project sounds more logical, some people believe that the projects should be student designed. Making students design the projects can be beneficial for them because they are learning to work like how a teacher does. Even though the student is making it, they still have to put it together like how a teacher would. However, students do not have enough experience on how to teach and make projects for a certain amount of people, which is why summer projects should be teacher designed.

Teachers have more experience in teaching than anybody else. They go to college to get their degree in teaching so that they can be qualified to teach. Some teachers further their education while they are teaching just so they can be updated and informed with new learning techniques and other important updated information. All students learn in different ways. Teachers get taught how to handle different types of learners. Teacher designed projects have a good amount of information that is needed to be successful.

Since teachers have experience, they know how to put together the information the right way. The way the information is put into the project is very important because if it is all over the place then it will not make sense to anyone doing it. It would also be a waste of time for the students doing it. If the information is put in correctly then that is beneficial for everyone and helps the students to learn and obtain the information instead of forgetting it. Making the project not too easy is very important also.

While putting together the project, teachers will make it challenging so that the students can obtain the information correctly. Making the project too easy does not help anyone and wastes time. Challenging the students helps them to actually have to learn and remember the content that they learned from that year. If a student designed the project, they would most likely not challenge them or their peers at all.

In conclusion, summer projects being designed by teachers makes more sense overall, because they have more experience and know how to teach in different way that helps everyone. The projects being student designed does not make sense. Students brains are not fully developed yet and are not ready to correctly make a summer project for all students. The students most likely do not remember most of the information that they learned to put it into one assignment for all of their classmates.
