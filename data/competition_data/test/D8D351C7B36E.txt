The author has a lot of background knowledge of Venus. The author supports their idea very well, making it easy to understand where he/she is coming from. The author puts in facts, opinions, and really gives the readers an understanding of why exploring Venus would be worth the danger.

The author states many facts to help their article thrive. They list all the reasons why it would be a good idea and what the dangers would be with going forth with exploring Venus. There are many different dangerous things that come with Venus.

First of all, the article states that Venus has the "hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system...

800 degrees Fahrenheit" meaning that even metal would melt on Venus. Not only the horrible heat, but it's made up of about 97 percent of carbon dioxide. Venus is just not the right place to get a hands-on experience with.

However, Venus is the "twin" of Earth. Meaning that they are close to the same shape and size. The only reason studying Venus would be worth it is because it could of been another Earth at one point. "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth" states the article. Which means that it is something to look inot. Possibly once having life on another planet other than Earth? That's a big deal. NASA can find out more about our Earth if they were able to actaully discover Venus.

Concluding this, I do not believe that we would ever really be able to find out much about Venus. All of the spacecrafts sent there have not lasted, the atmosphere is too complicated, and it would be to much work for little to no pay off. Yes, it would be nice to understand more and discover something that hasn't been done before. All in all it just doesn't seem possible. Even if the scientists were to float above Venus it just wouldn't be enough. They wouldn't be able to get samples, get a lay of the land, or even really good pictures for that matter. The author did put in some good facts on why we should and the dangers, it just doens't seem possible at the moment.
