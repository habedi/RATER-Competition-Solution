To Principal,

I believe the you should change the school policy cause if students fail classes they would have to take summer school. You see if all lot of students have C' s in their classes and do sports or other activities. They are more likely to fail because they will be more focus on the sport or the activity then their homework and school work. All the students should have a grade B in all their classes cause if you have high grades and do sports or activities without bringing your grade down you are a great student who can stay focus.

As well as I think having to have all B' s is good but I also believe you should leave it the way it is because many students wont do sports or activities and won't get as active as they need to be. As well as having fun with friends and have good times. Also if you do change it many students will be mad and wont do any school activities.

So here is something you should think about if you do change it not many students will do sports and other activities and will less likely to be happy but if you don't you might have some students struggling with their grades as well as their homework. That is my view on your school policy change hope you make the right decision.
