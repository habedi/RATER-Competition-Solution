Should cell phones be allowed in school?

Dear Principal,

I know you are considering to whether or not to allow cell phones in school. Well I have some suggestions on why we should be allowed. First of all, mostly what is thought about for the purpose of cell phones is just to talk and text. Though, the real purpose on why we were given cell phones in the first place at all was for emergencies. I think we should be allowed to have or use cell phones in school during lunch or free periods is because we might have an emergency to deal with, sometimes we just want to talk and hang with friends, and/or we have to contact our parents on where we are, with whom, and if or if not we will be at home or somewhere else.

The most important reason I think we should be allowed to have cell phones in school is for dealing with emergencies. Let's just say something very unfortunate happens like a loved one has passed away, you have to be contacted immediately in order to know because our parents may not be able to reach us or pick us up because of such misfortune. Also, maybe your parents are stuck at work so they need to call you to get a carpool because they know they won't be able to pick you up from school.

Another reason I see fit for allowing us to use cell phones, is because sometimes we students like to relax and just hang or talk with friends. Some friends might not have any classes together especially in middle school and high school since our schedules are different most of the time. So, we want to talk to them at every chance we get but since they might be going somewhere you may not be able to communicate personally so that's where the cell phones come in.

Lastly, we should be allowed to use our cell phones because may be we need to call or contact our parents on our whereabouts. Such as, maybe you are going to go over to a friends house to work on homework, a project, etc. Also, to tell our parents maybe we're going to be a little late coming home because of an after school class, club, or tutoring session.

So in conclusion, if you can kindly so review or consider some of my ideas on allowing cell phones I and the student body would really appreciate it. You never know what might come up so it's good to have such a device with you at times. After all, we students might need it for emergencies, to contact our parents on our whereabouts, or sometimes just to talk to friends.

Sincerely,

A fellow student
