I think your principal should allow student to bring cell phones to school and the student should be allowed to use their cell phones during their free time or at lunch periods but when they go back to class their cell phones should be turned off during class periods. That would give the student time to communicate with their parents or friends out side of the school. But when class start their cell phone should taking away so that would not get any ideas to start texting or calling people from their phones. Their cell phones should be put in a basket s0 at the end of that class period is over they can get their cell phones and go to the next class and they have you put their phones in another basket to so that they can get to have a full education and they wont be on the phone all day. If they don't follow presager their phones are to be confiscated if they are using it during class time. Then the teacher or principal should give the cell phone back to the mom or dad that pick them up. That would let the parents if the student using their cell phones and then they would be punished by the school to serve a detention or the school could let the parents take action for what their child did. An if the student refuse to give their cell phones to the teacher or principal they should be removed out of the school for that whole day and they would be aloud to come back to school the next day and if their behavior is has not improved the students need to be suspended. From the school for a few days bye then if the student continues to do the same thing over and over again the student should be expelled from that school.
