Phones and Driving

In this day in age you can see the amount of people using their phones and driving has rised. The idea of using a cellphone while the vehicle is being operated should not occur due to risking the lives of people inside the vehicle or outside. Although using a phone for an emergency is different. There are many ways on how to use a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Laws have been passed to prevent horrible things happening to people while texting and driving.

Phones and Driving would never go along with each other, it's a bad idea. In doing so half of the time a driver would use their cell phone to use social media or something that is not important and can be done on their spare time. Many accidents have happened before the world's countries have put up laws to regulate the use of a cell phone while driving. It's a huge distraction back then not many accidents occurred but many fatalities did. I believe that it is very useful to use a cellphone to navigate but there's a way in doing so.

Emergencies can occur at any moment and anytime without knowing when it will happen we can't control that. Even though tragic things can happen it is best to stay off your phone to avoid causing major or tragic problems. A simple glimpse at your phone can make you lose control of the wheel anything can happen. It is better to pull over if necessary to stay safe and keep those around you safe as well.

Countries and states around the world have this as a problem of people getting distracted easily by a phone. It has been a hard process to regulate this till this day people have caused many harm. Although tickets and warnings don't really help the situation but it does stop some people. Getting punished for putting lives is not fair, nobody would want to die due to a distraction.

In conclusion driving and using a cell phone is not a good idea no matter the situation. Staying safe on the road is very important a little distraction is not worth crashing or a ticket or even putting others at risk. This is why I think no one should be able to operate a vehicle and use a phone there are many ways to talk on the phone with bluetooth a text message can always wait. Keep in mind that technology has a place and time to use. It shouldn't be taken as a careless manner while driving because it has caused many problems on the road.
