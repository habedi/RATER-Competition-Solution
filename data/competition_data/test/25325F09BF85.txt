I disagree that all students should take extracurricular activity's.

if a students take these extra activity's, If a kid dosn't want to do it then don't force them to, if a kid is doing a sport out side of school they should not have to do a sport in school and make them quit there sport that they are already doing one, it could over work the students.

If a student dosn't want to do the extracurricular activity's then why do you have to force them to do it. If you force the student to do it then they wont try if they don't like the thing there doing and fail. students should have the ability to chose whether or not to chose a extracurricular activity because if they dont want to do it they dont have to.

If a student is doing a sport out side of school than they should be able to chose whether they quit the sport there doing out side of school or be over worked with doing a sport in side and out side of school. if you have two sports it could over whelm students. students will give up or not try as hard in in school activities than out of school activates.

All of the thing student do in school is probably enoph but adding another thing could over work students or make them stressed out about all of the thing that they are doing. and as I said earlier student will give up and no try because they hate doing it.

In conclusion these are the reasons why I think students should not be forced to do extracurricular activity.
