Using technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in a classroom is not a good idea.

The FACS enables computers to read human emtions such as sad, happy, scared etc.

It uses a 3-D comoutuer model of the face and and the 44 major muscles to read your emtions.

Using the FACS in a classroom is not a good idea becuase it can cause distraction, limit human contact, and limit the amount of one on one time a teacher has to help the students.

The FACS should not be used in the classroom becasue it could cause distractions for the students.

The students could be more focused on what the computer says than what the teacher is teaching.

If the FACS breaks down then a student could feel left out and sad and that could distract them from performing their best in school.

The computer could also allow students to get off task and only focus on what is happening on the computer, or if the FACS is built into a regular laptop it could cause students to play games or do other things on the internet than learn in the class.

The FACS can be very distracting to students so they sould not be found in the classroom.

In school we meet new friends, bond with teachers and have human contact all day long.

If the FACS is in the classroom it could cause all of that to disapear.

This means that teachers could become less engaed with the class and students can become less engaed with learning.

Dr Huang states that "Most human communication is nonverbal, inculding emtional communication".

COmputers do not have emtions like huamns do.

The computer may be able to tell how we are feeling but they can not make us feel better if we are sad, or scared, or in destress.

This can cause students to feel more isolated and make them more sad, or scared etc.

When students feel this way it could ause more school violence.

FACS should not be in the classroom.

The third and final reason that the FACS should not be in the classroom is because it can limit the teachers one on one interaction with students.

Dr. Huang states "A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored".

Teachers are there to teach to interact with the students and sense if they are confused.

If the FACS does that for them and helps the student if they are confused then the teacher is not there to help the student.

This could also cause the student to be more confused if the computer is teaching them instead of a real life teacher.

FACS should not be in the classroom because it will limit the contact between student and teacher.

The FACS is an amazing innovation, but it should not be found in the classroom.

It should not be allowed in the classroom becuase it can be a distraction to students, limit human contact. and limit the amount of one on one time a teacher can have with a student.

It is important that school is a place to interact with others and futher your education but having a computer read your emtions in class will damage the school experience.

Therefore the FACS should be found in the classroom.
