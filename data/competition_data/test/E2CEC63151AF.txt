First of all i would like to say ,"For one aliens are not real at all so thats out of the convo". I aloso would like to know why is it so crazy for mars to have a face like figure on it. We have volcanos weird rocks all type of stuff , even in las veagas its a figure on the mountens that form the face of the devil . Thats way more scaryer then having a face on mars . But still how do u know aliens are even real ? the face could've came fro anything such as mars getting to hotand starting to brake apart . Neverthless, on april 8th, 2001 a cloudless day in cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look . they had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maxuiam resolution . Each pixel was in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.
