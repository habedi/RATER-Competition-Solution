In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", it shows how Venus actually is. It tells of how dangerous it is to explore, and learn more about. However, it also explains the importance of knowing about Venus. Here are some of the reasons stated on why it's important to know and learn more bout Venus.

First, it is thought Venus was once more Earth-like. It's believed that long ago it was covered in oceans. Also having features, such as, valleys, mountains, and craters, similar to the ones on earth. This excites and fascinates astronomers working on exploring Venus.

Second, Venus is sometimes our nearest planet to us. Venus, Earth, and Mars orbit at different speeds, causing Venus to sometimes be our nearest planet.

Which is a huge consinderation in exploring it, becaus eof long times of space travel. It is also known as Earth's twin because it is close in size and density.

Lastly, NASA is already working on a way to seend humans to Venus to study. NASA thinks a solution to the hostile enviroment is to let scientists float above the fray. If a vehicle could float above Venus, you could avoid its hostile enviroment. It allows them to stay up and away from danger. Though the temperatures and pressure wouldn't be easy, they would be survivable.

Therefore, exploring Venus is a good idea despite the dangers. We've already put a lot of work into developing plans to explore Venus, plus all the work we've already done to get them information we have. Venus is one of our closet planets, which is good keeping in mind the long time of space travel.
