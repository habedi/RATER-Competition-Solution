Schools that offer distance learning is a open option for student's. Can it be beneficial for student's to attend school classes at home as well as video chatting for conferences? My opinion on this statement is distance learning is not beneficial, Certain kids take advantage of online schooling to not attend school and to stay at home. Most few kids can't learn their material through computer and prefer being in a classroom and being taught verbally. Everyone's learning skills are different.

Online classes are like books on a computer and having to learn all your materials on your own. Attending school will help you learn more things about all your subjects. When having trouble with any subject you will have teachers and other students to go to when needed help.

Distance learning may effect your social life. Socializing with other student's at school is a great way to make friends. Going to school and having a routine every morning will help you to be independent and having you'r own responsibilities, it will prepare you as you get older. Although waking up in the morning can be harsh and very tiring, you must think about the future you want to have.

School is where you have opportunity's for many things. Doing online classes won't be like going to school where they give you opportunity's to go on field trips and have fun at the dances or participating in sports and clubs. If attending school you can make childhood memories to tell and the long run.

Distance learning is not beneficial you lose a lot of opportunity's and enjoyments. I have to strongly disagree with doing online classes at home. Going to school is where you find yourself and start to plan the future that you want to accomplish.
