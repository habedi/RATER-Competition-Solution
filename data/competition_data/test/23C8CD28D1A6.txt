In the world of technology there is a new FACS. This is where computers can identify human emotions. Although this could be in away very use full, people take there emotions serious and isnt something to use as a learning tool. Schools having the ablity to read us is a push to far into more personal area. I do not think that this technology is valuable for school.

Yes true that understanding how someone feels can better help you understand the situtation and what to do in such a situtation. "imagine being able to detect exacly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions." The best way to understand is privacy. There should be things that we keep to are selves.

Money could be a facter in this as well. IN schools all around the country, there are schools with more money then others. This new program take into consideration "a home pc cant handle the complex algorithms used" could the school aford to have the reqierments needed to have this exessable?

Faces dont lie. You can tell alot for someones face. Anything that you do could express something about yourself. Having myself known at any given time is unusaul to prosess. One that I couldnt see taking place.

How people feel have a big impact on others, people imitate others expressions and emotions. Not everyone feels the same but having your own feelings is improtant and people should have a choice to keep that to themselves.
