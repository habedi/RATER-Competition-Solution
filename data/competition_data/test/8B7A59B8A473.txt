I believe the face on Mars was not created by aliens. I believe the face is just a natrual land mass that looks like a face from far away. It's almost as if you were to see a person you think you know, but as you get close enough to see their face you dont know them at all.

Over the past years many astroids and space debre have hit or landed I could say on Mars. So if astroids landed on the elevated space in places where the eyes, nose, and mouth should be making it look as if a face was on Mars. The article states that the rock formation was as if it was an illusion of the features of a human on the mountain of rock. Another reason is that in the past the "Face on Mars" could have been a mountain. Meaning that the winds, dust, and dirt could have worn down the mountain making it into a mesa. The article states that many mesa's have been spotted around Cydonia, making it possible for the "Face on Mars" to be just another mesa. The article staes that NASA have taken many pictures of the face and they all revealed "a natrual landform." NASA stated that there was no alien monument. Another reason is that Mars used to be an active planet. So if the "Face of Mars" used to be a mountain it could have got run down by lava flows in the area. Making it into a landform thta looks like a face.

In conclusion there are many facts and theories about the "Face on Mars." People who think the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens will have a much tougher time proving that it was created by aliens. Therefore there is many more facts about the "Face on Mars" being a natrual land mass. These are just some of the reasons why I believe the "Face on Mars" is a natural land mass.
