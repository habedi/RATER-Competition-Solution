It has been said that some school's are requiring Students to complete summer projects to make sure students are still learning during break. However, critics are asking should these summer assignments be teacher designed or student designed ? If students are able to choose and design their projects, there Is a higher percentage of students who are willing to do It . Also, students will have excitement on doing this assignment due to the fact that they're able to add their own flavor into it ,Lastly students will understand what they're doing due to the fact that they're taking control. Although letting students choose their summer projects would increase the rate of students doing It , It would be harder for teachers to grade different assignments as If they were to just assign just one. Students should have the right to choose their summer projects because , Students are more likely to do It , Students are able to enjoy the assignment , and lastly students will be In control of their work .

Firstly, Giving students the opportunity to design their own summer assignments there is a higher rate of students who will do It. Because, They're not feeling forced to do the assignment but rather they feeling It In their heart to do It . For example If I am assigned a summer assignment over break and It Is student designed I feel like I would feel free, no one Is telling me to do the assignment. instead I would be want to do It . Another example would be If I am assigned a summer assignment and It Is teacher designed I wouldn't have as much determination to do as If It was student designed.

Secondly, students will enjoy doing this assignment due to the fact that they're able to add their own flavor into this design. for example If students are given the opportunity to add or design the project the way they would like It would bring enjoyment and excitement to the project, It wouldn't just be another project for them It would mean more and they would be more determined to get the project done. Another example Is If I'm given a summer assignment and I'm able to design the project how I would like, I would have a positive attitude In getting It done.

Lastly, students are in control of their work no one Is telling them how to do the project they're designing It on their own. That's where adding your own flavor comes in part for example If It was teacher designed students would feel as If they have to do It a certain way;they feel like they're not in control of the work rather the teacher is. Another example would be If It's teacher designed sometimes students find it difficult to do what the teacher is asking some students just find it easier to be able to have control of their work .

In conclusion, Students should have the right to custom their summer assignments due to : the percentage rate, the enjoyment, and the ability to be in control of your work . In today's society when students go on break they tend not to do school work , so If having them design their own work would raise that percentage why not do so ?
