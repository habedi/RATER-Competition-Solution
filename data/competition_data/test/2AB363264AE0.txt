Phones are A big problem every where you may go. Many companys or people such as school. May have a " no telaphone" sign up just to let you know phones are not allowed. Some people may not even pay any mind to it and still get on there phone and many think wh is it a BIG problem. But are they lil computers? Do theg mess up your mood.

Right now in 2018 , we ave have so much technology that a comouter could tell us what mood we are in. But making that come ture would be GREAT.Knowing that a computes know if you are down and see a ad pop up or you get bored and it somehing for you to work on maybe kids would love to come to school just for that. Like if we needed help it would modify something for us to work on.

Would you think students would stay of there phones if thoese computers was active in school for us to use, Maybe ? Maybe not . why because some kids just does not like school at all . So they woudnt even care about the Ads popping up.

I think that the mood technology would work becuse it also helps with being sad and you may never know something could be going on at home and it effects how they are learning. Teahers may be busy so you really coulded tell them so before you start you work. There always something to help you cheer up.
