The Many Reasons To Be A Seagoing Cowboy

Hellow my name is Luke and im going to tell you the many reasons to be a ¨Seagoing Cowboy¨.First, of all it allows you to go to many countrys that you may not get to afford to go to,and you get to tour if you have spare time to see many historical features like battle grounds. You may even get to see festivals and help thousands of people at the same time. If you have time after you did all the chores for the day you may be able to play games like baseball,volleyball,table-tennis tournaments and boxing but their is not just that theirs lots more to do.

Next, you may find time to go danceing or discover may cultures. You can eat new foods learn new games and spend well earned money on clothing and furniture. If your on your way home maybe you can fish or go sight seeing. If you get lucky you may be able to see the watery streets of Italy or Greece. To me the ¨Seagoing cowboys¨ program helped me see a lot I didnt know existed. These are the many reasons I went and loved the ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ program.
