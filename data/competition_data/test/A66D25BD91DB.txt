There are many challenges stated in the article about exploring Venus. In the next paragraph I will write a claim on how well the author supports the idea of studying Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers and an explanation of the evidence to my claim.

In my opinion, I think that the author didn't do a very good job on explaining the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because the author didn't give much evidence that it is about the pursuit being worthy. In the article the author explains a lot about the challenges of exploring Venus like the extremely hot temperatures and the "thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide," but doesn't explain very much about it being a worthy pursuit. The most that is talked about it being a worthy pursuit is getting insight on the planet like getting samples of the sediment on the surface of Venus and possibly getting the history of the Earth-like planet that is in our solar system.

In conclusion, I think that the author did not have very many good explanations for studying Venus on being worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
