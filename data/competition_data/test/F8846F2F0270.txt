Can you see a driverless car in the future? Google is working on a project. A car that can drive on its own. No one will ever need to buy a car again. There would just be driverless taki's everywhere.

Right now in this time, Google made cars that can drive by its self. These cars has senssors. It can detect if theres an object behind it, infront of it, And on the sides. these cars can drive its self to any location, you would just have to put it in the gps. Google cars aren't truly driverless; the person in the car would have to do it is pull in and out. The longest distence a driverless car has driven was half a million miles without crashing.

Every automakers is trying to make the best of the best. Making a car that can do everything. A car that dosn't need no one to pull in or out. A car that takes half the fuel that any car would be taking in this present time. A car that can detect people when there inside the car. A car that can travel million's of miles without crashing or breaking down. The best car creation built in history.

Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problem ahead will be solved. Tesla has a project a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot for 90 percent of the time. Other automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, And nissan plan to have cars that can drive them self by 2020.

There will be so much automakers that will try to make a car thats driverless, but the car is going to end up being so expensive that no one will want to but it. Google is trying to make so many cars that can drive its self, park its self, pull out its self and pick anyone up by its self. Google wants to make so many of these cars, Because google dosn't want people to buy cars anymore. All the driverless google cars will be public-transport taxi system. The taxi's will offer far more flexibility than a bus. Google believes such cars would fundamentally change the world.
