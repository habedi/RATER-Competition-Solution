Hi I am Luke and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. A SeagoingCowboy is someone that sails on a boat and the boat has farm animals that you take care of. I have been a SeagoingCowboy for nine years and I am still facinated at all the places we go to. I have been to the Acropolis in Greece, I also rode a Gondola in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Whould you like to be a SeagoingCowboy its a lot of fun and I forgot to tell you also get to feed the farm animals. It's a very long sail but it's worth the seightseeing. The night watch is like a job you have to check on the animals every hour to make sure their okay. But the night watch could be scary one time I fell and cracked my ribs.

There are also some fun things you can do on the ship once you drop of the animals. When you returning from dropping of the animals you can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Ping-Pong tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that helped pass time on the boat.

The animals on the ship were pigs, sheep, chickens, cows, roosters, horses, and goats. The most liked animal was the horses because they were nice and the fur was very soft. Every time at night you could here the animals for a litlle then they would finaly settle down.

Would you like to be a SeagoingCowboy if not thats okay but it's very fun. Being a SeagoingCowboy keeps you active and it helps you learn responsibility and being trustworthy. There are signups next year in New Orleans, Louisana. This is Luke we will se you in New Orleans next year.
