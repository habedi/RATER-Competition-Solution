I disagree with attend classes from home. Because at home there are thing that can distract the student from doing there work, homework and project.

When there is distract there is no work geting done and they are not being told by their teacher's to do the work or show their work on there homework or if they understanding the work they are being give by the teacher.

Also the student may cheat on the quiz or tests that the teacher gives out to there class. Because if they are home they can get the anwer from web site online and the teacher's never know. And also for the project they can copy from a other student that's in the same class as the student that's copying.

For any examples If it was the end of year. There was a big test that you needed to pass so you can pass the class and the school year and the student didn't know anything because he just copying off from this friend online. student didn't show his or her work or didn't let the teacher know that they don't know noting about the class work, homework the whole year. and now they are worry that they are going to fail the school year. Or they didn't study there work because of the distract at home like friend's,TV,Phone and anything else that keeps you way from doing you work at needs to be finish.

A good examples is if the student want to the school for the whole year. There will be not distract in class because the teacher's are there. So when teacher's is teaching all student will be quiet and learning. If the student's are taking a quiz,test or a project they can see what they are doing because they are going to try to cheat on there quiz or test so the teacher can stop that if at is going on. If they don't know how to do the work they can ask the teacher. If they still don't understand the teacher will show you how to do it over and over into you get it. Then when the school year is coming to an end and the big test are coming. Then all the student will be ready and the skills they learn from coming to school the whole year will pay off by passing the test and the class and the school year.

It's better if you go to school and lead it in person because you have the skills to do it and there is no distract in you class room and you will have no reasion to copy or cheat on your test or quiz.
