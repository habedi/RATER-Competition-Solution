I am in favor of keeping the electoral collage although you may think there are better ways to do it i think thats its worked for long enough so why change it now.Â  ''Under the electoral collage syster voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors ,who in turn elect the president.'' " the electoral college is a process consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of electoral votes by congress .'' theres nothing wrong with that and lastly it has a pourpose '' The electoral collage is a process not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. so i feel that it has a pourpose in which its serving so im in favor
