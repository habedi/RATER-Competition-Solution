Have you ever wondered about how another planet can be just like earth and how its terrain is well researchers have found out that venus can have the exact same terrain and other features to it as well.

Venus often referred as earth's twin has the same density and size and it is the closest to our planet as well. While researchers try to land a spacecraft on the surface of venus it is almost impossible to because the temperatures on venus are an average of 800 degrees farenhite. The pressure is 90 times more than what we experience on our own planet so we would be crushed if we stay there. Thats only the beginning of what goes on there, there is erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking on its surface. But even after that it is just like our planet earth because scientist have been looking at venus and found that venus has a surface of rocky sediment and othr features like valleys, mountains, and craters. They have also found out that there use to be covered in largely oceans and also could've supported various forms of life.

The conclusion to all this is that even though venus is dangerous and also good at the same time that we can still explore it and possibly have human life living there.
