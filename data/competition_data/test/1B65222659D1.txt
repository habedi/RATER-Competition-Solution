Dear Mrs. Principal

I don't think its right that your changing the school policy. Are school has had the same policy for the longest time and now you want to go and change it. I don't care if I get in trouble, and I don't mean that disrespectfully, but your wanting to here my opinion on this situation and i'm going to tell you.

Why must students have at least a grade B average to participate in school activities and sports?

Are school was just fine the way it was. Most of the students here are very smart athletically and academically. But now your telling the students if they want to join any sports or activities they have to have a grade B average. That's going to be really tough on many of them. What if there's going to be a big test on Friday and a big basketball game? What are the students supposed to do? They can't stay at home and study they'll get kicked off the team if they don't go. But they can't just go to the game because then they'll bomb the test and get a grade C average. And if that happens then they'll still get kicked off the team. Then you never know there's a good chance that either they'll stop trying at school work and fail or try harder. Do you want to take the chance though? I know i wouldn't.

So, I think in my opinion and most of the other students you should keep the same old policy. Keep it at you have to have a grade C average to participate in any school sports or activities. We all liked it that way. If you decide to take my advice and keep it the same then i'd bet that we would have the best school athletically and academically. All i'm asking is for you to at least think about what your reading and what i'm telling you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME and many other students.
