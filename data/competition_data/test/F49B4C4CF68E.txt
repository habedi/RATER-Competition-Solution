The idea of driverless cars sounds very unsafe/ unnessasary. We don't need to be spending more money funding this. Lets start with saying are people really that lazy to not want to drive themselves? We need to be able to have complete control of our vehicle at all times! Anything could happen when putting your trust in a car. The car could completely malfunction and lose all control and cause a huge crash and could really hurt someone. Imagine your car losing control and wrecks into someone and kills them! You would be charged with murder because you didn't have all control. Cars are expensive enough just imagine how much these cars would be! We are too busy spending all our money on stupid ideas like this and we have much bigger problems!

There is some good in these cars like not wasting as much money on gas or if you aren't that good of a driver they do most of the driving. You wouldn't have to worry about drinking and driving home. This also would also help with texting and driving you wouldn't have to worry about watching the road and your phone.

But just because there are a few perks to a driverless car doesn't make it any safer! I completely disagree with driverless cars, i know they will cause many accidents and lead to many injuries or even deaths that could have been saved due to lack of control of the vehicle.
