Phones and Driving

Drivers should they or should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle? Drivers should not attend to a mobile device while operating a vehicle. This action is the main source of car accidents due to decreasing the drivers awareness on the road causing injury and/or death .

Some states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones while driving to take precaution. Driving distracted is one of the main causes of car accidents over the last two decades. Each year 6 million cases of car accidents take place, which roughly per day is 16,438. About 3 million people are injured or disabled and 6,000 deaths happen annually. According to statistics in 2010 the loss of human lives due to car accidents cost almost 1 trillion dollars, the highest price we pay for the loss of others in the collision of vehicles.

Most states have passed or are passing a law, illegal to use your phone while operating a vehicle. Most states banned use of cell phones while driving are different from others or either similar. For example the state of Georgia banned all drivers under the age of 18 and school bus drivers to the utilization of phones. As in Arizona school bus drivers and learner's permit and existing license holders during the first six months after licensing aren't allowed to operate a mobile device while the driver's vehicle is in motion. Although these states' rules are slightly contrasted from each other, the use of texting, hand held calls, and possession of devices in the palm is prevented.

Cell phones are a very dangerous distraction to you and those around you, but can have its benefits such as navigation and the use for help or assistance. Many cell phones have GPS assistance which provide direction to arrive at your designated destination. Cell phones also allow users to contact aid whether its an ambulance, the police, or help with your car while on the road. Although these actions are very safe they should not be acquired while a vehicle is in motion to prevent any dangerous interactions.

In conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving. Put down your mobile device, the call or text received is worth the wait than worth being in a major or minor accident. Without the distraction your attention is focused on the road and your surroundings. This action taken is safer for you and your environment.
