Several students in high school fall behind others because of fast-paced classes, unfamiliar environments, and general confusion from what the teacher is saying. This creates gaps in the student's learning, which can affect them greatly in the future. Recently, schools have been offering students the ability to learn from home. This newer way of teaching is beneficial for students, and their learning gaps. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because you are in a familiar environment, you can go at your own pace, and take classes that might not be offered at your actual school.

A big issue in today's school system is the lack of familiarity. For me, going from a warm home to a rather cold, and loud school on a Monday morning isn't the best transition. This has definitely caused me stress in the past simply because the environment isn't the most welcoming and it's not my preference. With online school, you can bring the education to you. Doing the same work, but at your kitchen table seems more enjoyable than at a small desk with several other people struggling to understand the same content.

Have you ever felt behind or confused in the classroom? When learning from home, I'm able to go back, or replay the information that I might've missed in an actual class, where asking questions might cause anxiety or even stress. Even if you're more advanced, then you could speed up the videos or even test out(take an assessment to prove you understand the knowledge) of certain subjects that you might already know.

Not every school offers courses that people would like to take. There are a lot of students who are forced to take classes that aren't interesting. At my old school, I was learning Chinese. I realized that Chinese isn't offered here but is offered online. With online classes, I'm able to continue my foreign language education without much hassle. This is great for students who want to learn beyond what is available at school which can provide an edge to that student's learning.

Some might say that going to a physical school provides more structure because of the fixed schedules and set pace from teachers; however, giving students the opportunity to work at a more personalized pace can be significantly more beneficial than traditional school. Learning from home, or online school is a great way to close certain gaps in a student's learning which is perfect when trying to receive a higher education.
