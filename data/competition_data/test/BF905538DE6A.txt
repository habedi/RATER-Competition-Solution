In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers in presents. The details that help support this claim is that for example "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus, because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." Another reason is that, " Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth.." the author then begins to mention some of the features that Venus has as well as Earth, such as valleys, mountains and craters. Now despite the dangers that could and can come from taking a visit down to Venus hasn't stopped NASA from trying to find ways to make this mission "both safe and scientifically productive". Within the text it states that, "NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus." then it gives examples such as a "blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape." NASA is still working on other possible approaches to make this mission happen. Sure there may be many challenges effecting Scientisits and researchers from exploring and studying Venus, but that dosen't mean its impossible. Towards the end of the of the text the last supporting details that conclude that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is the follwoing, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." and "Our travles on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.". In conclusion studying Venus is absolutley worthy to persue dispite the dangers it presents.
