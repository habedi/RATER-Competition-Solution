There are people all around the world that have decided to say no to cars and their polluting fumes. Certain places have even gone as far as having car free days. Limiting car usage will greatly benefit the Earth and the people on it.

Limiting car usage would help decrease some of the pollution in the atmosphere, which is definitely something that needs to be done. When a car is driven all of that gas has to go somewhere and with the amount that people are driving now thats a ton of waste that's polluting the air. Elisabeth Rosenthal presented the informaton that twelve percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are made up from passenger cars and fifty percent in the United States. Those numbers can be decreased if people choose walking, public transportation, biking, or car pooling instead.

Studies have shown that eliminating driving, or at least limiting the usage, has caused citizens to be less stressed. Heidrun from germany said, "I'm much happier this way,"(In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,paragraph 3). Cars are very stressful so why should they be used if there are other options? Without cars people would be less likely to worry about loved ones arriving to a place alright and would just be happier in general.

To wrap things up, cars are dangerous, polluting, and stressful. Limiting their usage would help eliminate some of the risks and dangers of driving. There are many alternatives to driving, such as walking, car pooling, public transportation, biking, skating, the list goes on. Make the smart choice and use cars less.
