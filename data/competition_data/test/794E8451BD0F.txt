What I Think

I dont think the alien made the face because, how could aliens make a face like that and where could they get the materials to make it pop out like that? I think the Face is a natural landform because, first of all, if the aliens crated the mask, how did space scientists find it? Second, how did they get the materials to make the mask? Last but not least, how did the aliens make the face like that? I dont think aliens made that face because how can you posibly believe that aliens are are real? Aliens arent even real because if they were real, their head would not even be like that. Take a really good look at the photo to see who you think made the face. If you take a good look at the face you could tell that the face is made from a real human and not a alien. Where could aliens get sement from to even make the face pop out like that? I dont believe that aliens made a face like that because it is impossible for a type of species to do somehing such like that, aliens arent even real because scientist have been looking for them for a long time and they have not found one yet. That scientifically proves that aliens are not real they might be somewhere hiding or scientists havent found them yet. I dont even think aliens are a species.

Thank You
