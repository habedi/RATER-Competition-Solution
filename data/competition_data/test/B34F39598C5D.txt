To principle,

I think it's a great idea to perform community service. It teaches kids responsibility and that working for a good cause is a nice thing to do. Just taking away 30 min every day won't hurt anybody. The only thing I don't like is to force kids to do it. Maybe just extra credit or something would be better. The kids won't get the message if there working because they have, they should be working because they want to, and to know that their doing it for a good cause, and that they should do it more often because it feels good to do the right thing. You can make a big difference by just taking some of your time out of your day to do any type of community service. So you shouldn't force kids to work, but to convince them to think about it, and how good, and helpful one person can be by performing community service. Or another idea the principle can do is that he can have an assembly or something to tell all the kids about how much fun, and good it is to perform community service. Then require all the kids to do one community service activity to show them how great it is. Then if they want to they can keep doing it knowingly there doing it for a good cause, because they want to, and to know your doing the right thing.
