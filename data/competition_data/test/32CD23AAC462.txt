Do you think its fare to not participate in sports if you have a D or below?

Well my response to that would be a yes i agree because, students shouldn't have the right to participate an any sports. Cause its telling students that it is ok to have a D and participate.

First reason, why i agree to this prompt because, its saying that students don't care if they get a D or below but they just still want to do the sports and that's not right.

Secondly ,the reason why i agree cause if they are in class and the sports they want to do is today then they are going to be thinking about the sport. Not there school work and i think that school goes first before playing sports.

finally, my reason why i think that its a right in school probably because, they are going keep getting bad grades in the class and not going to be focus on the education but on the sport so i don't think they have the right to play sports and get away with it.

in conclusion, i told you why i think it inst right to get a D and below . Now what is your answer if u had to agree or disagree.?
