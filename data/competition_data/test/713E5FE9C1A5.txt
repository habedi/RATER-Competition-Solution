Hi im Luke im going to tell you why you should join the

Seagoing Cowboys program. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to explore the world and you will get to deliver animals to places all the way around the world. You will get to visit Greece, China, and other places all through Europe. You will get to go to Asia and help people who are in need. For more information ill tell you what i did when i was in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I started the group when i was 17 and i sailed all across the world i went to Grecce and i saw the Acropolis. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. "So i was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program it will open the whole world up for you if you live in a big city like i did. I also found time on board to have fun, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and vollyball games in the emptu holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Thats why im here today to tell you about all the fun you will have if you join Seagoing Cowboys program. But theres only one thing to worry about witch is if its raining and you are out at sea try to be careful i was out on sea and it was raing and i slipuped when i was going up a latter and fell and almost fell of the ship but the railing saved my life, but i couldn't work for a few days because i cracked my ribs. I hope you all will join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
