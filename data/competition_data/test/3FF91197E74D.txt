Dear Principal

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am in the eight grade. I have herd that you want to add a new policy about cell phones. Before you make up your mind let me you how i feel about cell phones. I think that you should allow the students to have phones at school and any free time they should use them. The only reason i want that is because some students have problems at home and parents need the student to have there phones at all times. If you do not allow phones at school what is the student going to do. If you take away phones from the school that would not be fair to the people who follow the rule and have phone. I know that if you take away phone the good students will start behaving bad. But at the same time be very strict about turning off your phone in class because some of the students will not follow the rules. Thank you.

Yours truly
