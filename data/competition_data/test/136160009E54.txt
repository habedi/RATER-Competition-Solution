In "The Challenage of Exploring Venus," the author claims on how studying venus would be a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. The Author backs up this claim by incluiding inforamation in pargraph 7 that involes Nasa delvoping "elctronics made up of silicon cardide that is being tested in a chamber to simulate Venus acidfied surface." Pargraph 7, also includes that Nasa is "using old technology known as Mechinal computers, which uses gears and leavers which are more deriable in venus atmosphere." Nasa hopes delvoping these electronics could help scientist get a personal close up that could help researches to find out if Venus was once an earth like planet that once able to support life.

However, in paragraph 3 the authour mentions that Venus can reach an

"average tempture of 800 degress ferinhight," and Venus having an "atmopseric pressure that is 90 times gratter than planet earth. Not to mention Venus enviorment causes powerful earthquakes, and lighting strikes that mainly target the ground. Then in paragraph 5 the authour adress the issue by claming "that Nasa would allow scientist to float around the planet, so they can research planet without worrying that Venus sulferic acid would not melt the rocket, and the scientist."

However this also dosen't rectify the problem because paragraph 6 debunks the solution by claiming that "perring at Venus from a ship that is oberting the planet, would not allow most forms of light to pentrate venus dense atmosphere , which effect the photography that would make it immposabile for scientist to even attempt studying the plantes rocks, and geographical fetaures.

Inconclusion, scentist should probally put off the project because earth has not delovped the technology would be most likely destoryed once it reaches venus. Instead Scientist should begin the project once we have delvoped the apporiate equitment that can wuithstand Venus harsh enviorment, temptures, and pressure.
