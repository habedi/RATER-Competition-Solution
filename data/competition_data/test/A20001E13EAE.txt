Dear principle,

The policy change requiring students to have a B average, I don't think that it the very best policy to have at this school. It is very hard for some students to keep up their grade average and putting more stress on them in school work will make it even more difficult for them to keep up their grades; with all the stress being forced upon them. For some students who struggle with school, Sports occasionally is the only was for them to really excel in something and feel that they did something well. Or it is just something to do to relax from home or school stress. For students with learning disabilities it is hard to even maintain a C average they have special classes they have to take to keep up in class and It isn't fair to them if they have to be compared with a non-disabled student who has a A average. students who are great at sports and help improve the team may not get to play if they are struggling with a subject. All in all sports is a great way to feel good about yourself and making it harder to play the sports kids love isn't a great was to improve grade averages at school.
