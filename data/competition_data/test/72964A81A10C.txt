Dear TEACHER_NAME

Community Service!

I would like for you to take into consideration of making all of the Students in seventh and eight grade to do at least 20 hours of community service to be able to graduate. The reason I am bringing up this topic to you is because it shows the community that the students of SCHOOL_NAME

are helping to keep our community clean and to help other people understand that everybody does something for the planet. I see so many people litter in and outside of school and I don't think they realize how important it is to keep our planet clean. So we don't have pollution and other problems.

I think that we should start to recycle and by doing all of this more people might come to our school to enroll there children. The publicity could be good for our school and then later on for the students. The children can be learning good life lessons and it can help them to keep up the good work all the way threw there lives. It creates a good building block for the students and it will help our school and planet be clean. The more people seeing us clean up our parks and schools, libraries and neighborhoods the more people will also help to keep our planet clean.

I picked twenty hours because It is not to much time, but yet students still have a chance of doing what they want on the weekends. We have homework and school five days a week and homework that takes two hours and over and doing to much community service will give the students no life for fun. If I had picked 45 hours the students would have to fun and that's what childhoods all about. So twenty hours is not too much time and you can still have most of your weekends free but you are also helping to keep your community clean and to show that you are a good student at SCHOOL_NAME and that you care about your planet.

I hope you consider my argument. It shows what good students we are and how much we care but yet it helps us build up our lives and still lets us live the life we want.

From,

STUDENT_NAME
