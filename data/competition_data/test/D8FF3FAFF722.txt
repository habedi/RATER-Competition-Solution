Dear fellow citizens I think you should join the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrarion. I think you should join becase it is a very nice thing to do. You also get to take care of animals and food on a boat. By doing this you can help countries in need.

Many people say that this is a boring job or useless but if they would try it they might see actually how good of a job it is. If you have this job you get to travel the world. You also get to see many outstanding places around the world. You get to explore oceans. While on the boat when we don't have any animals we play games like baseball, boxing, and table-tennis. Doing this beats sitting in a chair behind a desk filling out papers but I guess some people would rather do that then explore.

If you are looking for a helping and traveling job this is the one for you. Please go for this job traveling the world instead of sitting in an office building. Many people will say that this job is too much hard work. It does take some hard work but that is good for the body. I hope to see you on the next job.
