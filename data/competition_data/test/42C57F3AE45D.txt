We discovered the face on mars twenty-five years ago and since then we have not uncovered anything that tells us there are alien life forms living on the planet. Is it still possible for there to be aliens on the planet, maybe. We could go back to the planet and see if there is any evidence of alien life forms now.

The face on Mars is formed from wind blowing dirt and sand around, pileing it up and packing it together. Now it just so happened that it managed to form a face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Now is this a strnge thing to have happen, yes it is indeed but it still happened all on its own. If we were to go and look at the photots you would see that there are no footprints or anything aroun the face, there is just the face.

Unless the alien life forms are living beneath the planet there are no aliens. Is it possible for aliens to be living underneath the ground of the planet, yes it is possible. For all we know there could be aliens living underneath the crust of our planet. We do have yet to discover everything but for now we will assume that there are no alien life forms living in this galaxy, maybe in another galaxy but not this one.
