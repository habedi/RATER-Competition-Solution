I believe that the Facial Action Coding System can be a valuable asset to student in a class room . The System can read the face of the student to give feed back to the teachers on the lesson plan . It can be used to notify the teacher when a student in the class is upset . The System can also make learning "fun" for the students . There may many counter arguements but allow me to explain why .

My first reason it can be a valuable asset to students in the class is that it can give feed back on the lesson . In the text it says " A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming bored or confused" and it also says " Then it could modify lesson, like an effective human instructer" . This means that when a student is not getting the criteria the Fscial Action Coding System will read their facial gestures and make the assignment easier or more understandable . People may say " This system wouldnt be balanced because some people may be of grade level " . My claim is that the point of the system is to help them understand the criteria that they are learning to help them get back on grade level .

Another reason this system will be great is because the system can notify the teacher when the child is upset . With this advanced technology we can prevent alot of things from happening in school . In the text it says " Most human communication is non-verbal , including emotional communication " . The system can identify this and notify the teacher to talk to the student about his or her feelings . I believe the system can be a great asset to all the bad emotions or feeling going around school .

My final reason is that it can make learning "fun" for kids . Majority of the time students find the lesson plan boring , the system can read thier emotion and make it fun for them . In the text it describes how it can take the learning games and make them funner and more interacting . People may say " School is not about having fun " but students still need some type of entertainment even in highschool . The whole point of this system is to make the student adapt to the lesson plan , in a fun learning type of way .

The Facial Action Coding System will be a valuabe asset to students in a classroom . The system can adjust lesson plan or criterea for the student . It can help notify the teacher when a student is upset . It can also help make the lesson plan fun for the students . This is my arguement on why the Facial Action Coding System will be valuabe in the classroom .
