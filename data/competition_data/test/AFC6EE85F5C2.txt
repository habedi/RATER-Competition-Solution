Some scholls offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. I think it will be better to assist school then have classes at home because students will not have contact with their teacher during class, students will not pay attention, and students will not have contact with their classmates during class.

First, no contact with their teacher. For example, students will not have the teacher to help them during distance learning class. Students will need to wait until the teacher is finish. Another example, when you have another class you will not be allow to log in into the other class to ask a teacher a question about your home or other classwork you have.

Second, students will not pay attention. An example of, students at home will not pay the attention they need. They will like to watch TV during class or talking to their parents because the teacher will be teaching and not paying attention on what the students are doing.

Finally, no contact with their classmates. For instance, students will not have contact with their classmate for help or if they have questions during class. Another example when you have classwork you can work together with your classmate to do well in class.

In conclusion, is better to assist school because you can ask your teacher for help, pay attention, and ask your clasmates questions to understand more and do well in class.
