do you want to have your computer reading your emotions? well new software has came out were it can actually read emotions based on your face muscles. I think it would be a great idea because if we get bored then it can change pace or something to make us energisted and the computer could help if you are confused.

the computer could change its pace so we dont get bored. for example if you are sitting in math class working on your computer and you start falling asleep, but if we had this in our class. the machine will keep us awake. "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored ..."(6).

second if you get confused and a teacher is helping another student your computer could help you with that problem, but i do see where other people are coming from with it envades privacy and it not ethical but i don't belive it for a minute.

in conclusion, computers can help us with our every day lives with students being confused or bored, and even hospitals someday. till then lets keep innovating.
