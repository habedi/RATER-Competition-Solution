I think is a great idea to have this type of learning program, very helpfull for students,

In my case it will help me in many ways as:

1. I can be dressing any type of clothes,( APROPIATE).

2. I won't be expose in a place that bad people can get in to and make a shooting or something like that.

3. I'll be helping my family because I will have more time for myself.

4. Im going to be able to get a job because Ill have more time.

5. We all know that home is the place we all feel comfortable,I think that if we spend time studying at home we wil like it.

Here at school we are expose to so many things, You never know if anybody from outside will get in here with a gun, and will start shooting us, for no reason, or just because he is involved in bad things, this is a great idea of preventing bad things that are coming up and you dont expect them.

I think another good reason is that we wont be expose to this weather that changes frequently, sometimes we think is a joke but you dont know how bad this is for us,this way we will be at home with a good temperature ready to study.

In my house most of the mornings there's nobody because my mom works, and my dad too, so I think I will be focus more in what the teacher is telling me.

I think this method will also help my teacher, She will have more time, She won't be worrie about being on time.

I think this will also help the school, they will be saving some more money, they will save gas, and space.

I have a friend that lives in baltimore but in the place he lives theres basically no school around, Is a rural area so he had to study online an this change his life in a good way because he didn't knew about it till my uncle told him abpu it, and he request for an application form online and they approved, He was so happy because finally he made it and he was able to study without traveling to other state just to study
