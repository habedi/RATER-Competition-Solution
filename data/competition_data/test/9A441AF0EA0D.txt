Having sports in school is more of a activity and something most students would like to participate in. Sports should not be your first priority though, your grades should be. Having the choice to do sports in school is a gift. And if you would want to do sports you should have certain requirements. If you would like to play in sports in school then you should get good grades, such as an average with B' s and above. But if you bring your grades down to a C then maybe you can get some extra practice or credit to raise it up. Having a C isn't bad, but if you would like to play sports then your requirements and goal should be higher then others. When you are on a tem at school people look at you as a ro -model ands a more of a leader. If you have bad grades think they are going to think that it is easy to have bad grades.

You should set goals if you want to play sports and they should be to get better and to be the best that you can be, and to get good grades and to be a good student. If you get in trouble at school then you should be off of the team, but with the circumstances your coach could decide on what to do to you. When you are on a schools team you are doing an activity and which activities come after school, and if you grades go behind then you shouldn't be allowed to do school sports.

Reasonings why i support that is because if your not a kid who gets good grades then your going to fall behind and then loose lack of education.

Therefore those are my reasons why i think that if you want to play in school sports then you have to get good grades such as b' s and above.
