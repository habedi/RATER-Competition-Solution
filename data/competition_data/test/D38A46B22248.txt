Summer is the time of year where students all over the world finally get to relax. They do not have to worry about any responsibilities; they can just remember what it means to be a kid. However, some schools are allowed to assign projects over summer. If kids are required to constantly be thinking about school and work, they should at least be enjoying it. Students should self design any projects assigned over summer because its their own free time, everyone has unique learning styles, and teachers aren't always considerate.

Children care about their summer vacations, because it is the only time they are truly free. A student looks forward to this vacation throughout the whole school year. They wait patiently, completing every assignment and every test, just so they can play outside in the summer sunshine. These kids don't want to finally get out of school to only have to complete yet another assignment. If the kids are having to do this project on their own break, they should at least be able to choose what they do. For example, if a student is assigned a project over summer from biology, they should be able to pick to do an animal studies on their own dog. An animal they know well, love, and actually would enjoy researching. Kids having to spend their vacation working should be able to choose what to work on.

Kids want to play, so they should be able to and have a project that adapts to their learning style. Every student learns differently. Having a project created by one teacher would be unfair to everyone else who doesn't think the same way. Allowing students to have some decision in what they do would be most effective in actually teaching them. Every mind learns differently and needs creative thinking involved to begin working. If kids were allowed to come up with their own projects, it would be much better than a teacher-designed project. The kids would not think of it as homework, but instead as something they want to do.

Teachers don't always know whats best for their students. Many teachers may just assign homework because they need more grades in the grade book. They don't always consider if it's necessary for the students learning. They don't think about the stress that homework inflicts on it's victims. If teachers were to create a project for students to complete over summer, it would cause lots of stress and resentment. Although, letting the kids design their own projects would help build a better bond between kids and learning. Teachers would then get a better feel for each student and see how each of their individual minds work. Letting kids design their own projects would also reduce the amount of work and stress teachers have to endure. Having to come up with a project that would be easy for every student to complete is hard as it is. Having to do this before a teachers own vacation is just torture. It would be a win win situation if the kids got to design the project.

If it was required that a kid got a summer project, it should be student designed. Kids are not thrilled about getting homework over their vacation, and they may not put their best effort. However, If the kids had the option to create their own project it would spark much more creativeness. Teachers would better understand their students and get a break from all the regulating. Both students and teachers would benefit from a student-designed project.
