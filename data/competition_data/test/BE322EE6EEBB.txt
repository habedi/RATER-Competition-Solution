The Electoral College. The electoral college is ,to the office of federal register, "Is a process, not a place", which, in reality, it is. The electoral college is something that the founding fathers established for a choice of voting. You can either vote your election in congress or by a vote of the citizens. In my opinion, I don't really think that this is a good idea. No one really knows who's voting for who. And most of the time, voters don't always control who they get to vote for. But this can be a good thing sometimes because it helps keep everything in order.

First of all, the electoral college is a bad thing because nobody really knows who's voting for who. Most of the time, soem voters get confused about the whole thing and end up voting for the wrong person. During the election, most people get, as I said before, confused. These people get confused because there's too much going on. theres one side voting for one person, the other side voting for the other, then out of nowhere here comes like, 3 more people that are racing, and no one even knew whos these people were because everyone is too caught up with the states votes being all over the place to focus on anything else.

Secondly, I really think that the electoral college is not that good of an idea because most people that are voting don't even get a choice on who they want to vote for. The legislative branch is technically suppossed to choose the electors of the state. The electors are the people who allow peoples votes to go through. They pretty much just sit there and say if your vote counts. And sometimes it doesn't count. If it doesn't, they just give you to the other candidate. So you really don't have a choice to as to which candidate you vote for or not.

However, this could be a good thing.
