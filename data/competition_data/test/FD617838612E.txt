I think that giving kids an after school activity is great because they could have more social time. Meaning as in they could see their friends more often and talk to them more. They could have more exercise physicaly and mentally based on their activity. And they could also make new friends to talk to and then they could have a better realtionship. But the only problem with this is that some students might not like staying after school and just want to go home early. So if the principal does this students could start acting up like they always do. And also another problem could also be that students might have somewhere to be or they already have a after school program that they go to. But another reason why this is good and also important is because students can find a new skill or talent that they never knew they had. And they could start improving on that and use that new skill or talent in the future. Students will also be trying out new things and this could possibly help them out with classes in their regular schedule.

And here are some activitys that students could particapte in. Sports, they could particapte in any sport and that could help them physicaly. Like football because most athletic students join football because of the many postions there are in the sport. In football students don't have to be in any type of physical form like it does not matter if you are skinney or fat. This is because football has many postions that will need bigger people so students who think that they are over weight and can't do any sports should try doing football. And if you are not really the physical type of person then schools also have other programs as well. Like if you are a more smart type of person or you are a person who likes calmer activitys and likes to exercise their brain out then you could go to the game club and their could be some board games their that require lots of smart thinking and stragety. This game could be like chess a lot of people like chess and I think that chess is a good game to learn and play because how it exercises the brain. So if a student wants find a game that is fun,easy and stragetic to learn and play I think that chess is the perfect game.

And if there are students who don't like physical or stragetic activitys then there are still dancing and chorus activitys. If students think that they can be good with instruments they could go in to band and do some practicing there and even though it is not an after school activity it is still a skill that students can learn and develop and could possibily be good at it. Band is pretty easy though because anyone can learn no matter how smart you are if you just put in the right amount of effort and practice and if you also pay attention during the class you will understand it easily. So that is what I feel about the extracurricular activitys I personally think that it is a great idea and it should totaly be a thing in school today and all students should try something new out.
