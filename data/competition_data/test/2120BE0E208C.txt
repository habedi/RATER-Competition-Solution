Venus is our sister planet and we should know more than what we already know. The extreme conditions are a challange but the facts that would come from exploring Venus would be very insightful.

The extreme conditions that are on Venus will be a challange. The high pressure, heat, erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and lightning that strikes probes that try to land there are not the best situatuion to be in. We have not found material or built a robot that can handle all of that for a long period of time. The weather would take the robot out before it got really good info.

NASA may have found a possible solution to this obstacle. Using older technology might be able to handle the conditions. Also having newer technology to float 30 miles above the ground to minimize damage. The problem with that is we wouldn't be able to get close enough to get samples or to explore as much as we would be able to if we had a strong robot.

Being curious beings is challanging and difficult but it is fun to have something that isn't that easy. Exploring Venus our sister/twin planet will be hard and expensive but nothing we can't do. Sometime in the future, most likely we will be living on more than just our planet we live on now.
