Driverless cars may be in out near future. I personally think that driverless cars will be a neat addition to the worlds automobiles, but may also be bad due to of safety issues.

Fully automated acrs may be a cool idea depending on hopw manufactures persue these ideas. Immagine needing to go on a long trip and not having to stay awake for the whole drive, then immedately crashing when you get to your destination. immagine being able to sleep while you travel the world in the comfort of your own car. Imagine not having to focus on the rad at all and be able to take part in conversations and games while driving on the road. this could be our future, but may not be a a very safe one.

In the story it says,"Presently, Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in controll at all times." I agree with this statement because what would happen if an automated car "looses connection"or "dies while on the road" resulting in a collision causting people their lives? who would be at fault? You? the Manufacturer? things like this have to be discused before you can even think about seeing a fully automated car in any future. Regulations need to be set so we can pass laws that allow SAFE automated cars in all of the world.

Automated cars will be a neat idea to bring to life, but it might be a little bit further into the future than you might think, but it may be the next big step in public transportaton. All we need to do is to figure out what to do if something happens while on the road.
