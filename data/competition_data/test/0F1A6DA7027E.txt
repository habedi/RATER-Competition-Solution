Extra is in the Name

Extracurricular programs are more school work and/or more time that students have to spend at school. Not many students want that. Students should not have to participate in extracurriculars because they might not have enough time, they will have no intrest in something they don't want to do and most students don't want that extra work. I know that most students don't want to do extracuricular activities and for the ones that do they will take them i nthe first place.

The first reason I think students should not have to take extracurricular activites is because a lot of them won't have time. It's that simple. After school, rather than going to some club or activity that they don't want to take in the first place, they may have sports practice or homework and studying to do. Whatever the student has after school is probabaly more important than the extracurricular activity that they are forced to take. For the activities that are in school, there will still be work to get done out of school as well. As a student I know that having too much can be very stressful.

The second reason I think students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities is they will have a lack of intrest. Most students won't want to take theÂ program so they won't try while taking it. It will be hard for whoever is running the program to teach, especially if it's not a grade and no one cares about it. On top of all that it will be a waste of time for both the students and the teacher and they just won't want to be there.

Finally, while the students aren't enjoying the extracurricular activity they will be rushing to get their work finished just get out that class or go home. The students are also likely to have an atitude and be rude to the instructor. Abviously the instructor won't like this and they too won't want to be running this program but he/she may be at force to run it like the students are to take it.

The three main reasons why students should not have to do extracurricular activites are not enough spare time for students, lack of intrest in program they are taking and students need free time time away from school rather than more work. Any school that makes students participate in extracurricular activites are just being cruel and mean to their students! It's extra curricular and not required curricular.
