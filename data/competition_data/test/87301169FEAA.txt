In the 21st century humanity has entered what has come to be known as the Digital Age. Through advancements in computer technology and communication in general, the world has become more connected than ever. One area in which improved communication has been seen is in education. Some schools have begun offering distance options for students to attend, ranging from online courses to video conferencing. Although some may disagree, these long distance options are not only a positive, but, must be expanded further.

The first major benefit of distance learning is more inclusively. There are many reasons different groups of students may not be able to get the education they need face to face. For instance, students with certain disabilities may not be able to attend school. There may also be an absence of schools within reach that can properly help with their disabilities; Therefore, it would be highly beneficial to allow these students a means by which they may get their education, even if they can not physically attend class. In a similar vein, there are many students who may not have physical access to schools that work for them. These students may be unable to truly get the education they need; However, with a more interconnected world students who are physically unable to may finally gain access to courses and learning styles that truly allow them to gain the education they need, and pursue their career. A group of students that is in a less dire situation, but would still benefit are people who may be absent for one reason or another. A sick day at the wrong time may severely impact a student's grades, but may be necessary for the well being of themselves and others. By allowing temporary in-home access to school for absent students the penalty for taking the rest they need is far less.

Another way in which offering long distance means of education would help is by expanding education as a field. For the most part, in terms of public education, what can be done is mostly limited and far too similar; However, with the advent of long distance education far more ways of learning could be introduced for students and teachers alike. One way this could be seen is expanding the reach of schools and educational facilities as a whole. Through improved communication more schools could reach a greater number of students, helping each student find a style of learning uniquely suited for them and their needs. This could also allow teachers a greater reach, helping them find the best students and teach to the best of their abilities. Through this process both teachers and students will optimize their abilities to teach and learn respectively. Most importantly, distance learning would provide new opportunities for the field of education to expand. Having to engage with distance learning would create new obstacles; However, this adversity would provide situations in which the means of education occurs, and would force them to expand. Just as diamonds are created through immense pressure, so to would new challenges force schools to become even greater.

In Conclusion, recent major improvements to communication provided by the digital age would have a massive positive impact on the way in which learning is done, especially for those who can not attend school physically. Distance learning provides both a means by which the less fortunate can still receive the luxury of education and allows schools, teachers, and students to see improvements to the ways in which education as a process occurs. Some may argue that increased use of distance learning would promote absentees and hinder students abilities to learn, but innovation and inclusion are always goals to be pursued. Distance learning provides an opportunity for all students and teachers to connect and better themselves, which is a goal that must be pursued.
