While I was growing up, my father taught me many things that would help me in the future. Some of the teachings are warnings that would distract me and would not find my way back to the way I was before. This is caused by drugs, pornography, murder, stealing, and etc. But the point is, one of the teachings was to put my priorities straight. He said if you do not put your priorities straight then you will have an unsuccessful future. That has been one of my goals, and that is to be sure I have a plan to know what I will be doing in the future.

One of my priorities is school. While I was growing up, I was taught to work hard for school so that I may have a successful career. I was taught to be sure to have straight A' s and not get into trouble. I was very fond of school and addicted to school until I had learned of a new hobby that I desired. That was sports. I have learned over the years that sports are distracting. The school year was combined with football. I started to nudge football as my number one priority. Therefore, my grades dropped and I was miserable. I tried everything to get back on track but my coach was always there to make sure that my athletic ability would never be lost because he needed me on the team I played for.

My parents were worried about sports how it intervened with school. So they began to make sure I would put extra hard work for school. I did everything to get back on track. Ever since I was in junior high, I have never earned a four point 0 in my GPA because of sports. But now I am losing the desire of sports because of my focus on education. I am earning better grades than I did before and I believe that this hard work will help me to receive a triumphant career.

My point is that sport players should set their priorities straight. Education should come before sports. Some people believe that if you are athletic enough to go to professional. Yes, but what if an injury occurs that could affect you whole career. Now what do you do. If your priority was a sport than education and you are not able to go back to sport then you must return back to school. You will regret it over the future. I have a brother who went to Kansas to do sales. He earned large sums of money because of his success. My father did not see this as a smart idea. He made sure that my brother would realize that his education in college was still important. He did not want my brother to rely on making money by doing sales. My father said that if troubled times come and are unemployed then you will regret the day you turned away from your education.

Yes, I do believe that you must have a B-average to play a sport. Set your priorities straight and take precaution of your education. Education is very helpful these days in America. America's economy is failing and unemployment is sky rocketing. The only thing you can turn to is your education. You need money to support your family or see your family fall apart. Do not take pride in your sport or you may regret it in the future.
