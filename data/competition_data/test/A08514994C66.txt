Many students are tired of having to wake up early every morning to attend school. Due to this, some schools offer a distance learning program that people believe will benefit the student by allowing them to work from home. Distance learning is not beneficial because the student will lose valuable life traits, and the student will suffer.

While many people believe that distance learning will still allow students to gain important life skills; in fact, the students lose valuable traits needed in society due to not going to school. The students lose social skills by being at home all the time. The inability to communicate effectively with other humans is lost by not attending school. The students who do not come to school will have a hard time obtaining a job that involves speaking to another person because they did not learn how to when they should have. Additionally, the student also loses the ability to be independent when they are learning from home. Educational institutes teach students how to be independent in the future, and students who do not physically attend school will, after they graduate, constantly beg for everything to be handed to them. Students who never learned how to be properly independent will also never want to work for anything, thus furthering their need to rely on others. Furthermore, students who learn from home will undoubtedly lose the ability to make lasting friendships. Not being able to meet and interact with people at a young age significantly lowers an individual's circle of friends. Not having friends also makes a person feel lonely, having nobody to talk to or laugh with. Distance learning greatly reduces the skills an individual will possess, not allowing him to become a fully functioning member of society.

People say that distance learning will make the student want to do work; however, the student will only suffer due to not attending school. The student's grades will suffer by not arriving at campus every day. Being comfortable will make the student do less work, therefore lowering his grade. Students will likely sleep through courses rather than complete them because they are at home instead of school, which will lower their grades. Moreover, students will also suffer mentally while not attending school. Being the only person who attends school online will result in the student getting cyberbullied by his classmates outside of school, therefore taking a toll on his mental health. Not being able to ask for help effectively if one needs it can stress a student out, hurting their brain. Also, the student physically suffers by not attending school. By not physically walking from class to class each day, the student's legs will grow weak and may eventually give out if not worked on. Students participating in distance learning courses are incapable of taking physical education, which is a very important course, strengthening an individual's body and mind. Indeed, distance learning makes the student suffer in more ways than one.

While distance learning may be needed for certain people, such as ones with illness or disabilities; nevertheless, for the majority of students, it is not very beneficial. Students who attend distance learning courses suffer more than students who physically attend school. They suffer both mentally and physically, and their grades spiral downhill. Distance learning courses also prevent students from obtaining life skills needed in their future. Skills such as communication and independence are lost when the student does not arrive to their educational building each and every day. If distance learning becomes more popular, students all over the world will live in a future where they cannot function properly, and the generations to come will not have much of a society to live in.
