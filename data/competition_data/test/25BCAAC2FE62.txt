Dear Principal,

Considering the two cell phone policies, I personally think the first policy that allow students bring cell phones and use them during free time is better. Parents gave cell phones to their children because they want to know about how their children are doing at school; did their children get to school safely; and keep contacts with their children. Therefore, children need to bring a cell phone to school, to tell parents they got to school safety, so parents don't have to worry all day.

If their is an emergency that children need to call their parents or family members, cell phones are the easiest and fastest way to contact them.

However cell phones should be turn off during class time, because they are distractive not only to one person, also to the whole class, it interrupted the teacher or the students and wasted some class time for students to learn. For example, if 30 people's cell phones ring at the same time and everyone picks up their phones, then the entire class period is wasted.

As you can see, cell phones should be turn off during class times in order for the students to learn things using the entire class periods.

Most teens today have a cell phone, there are all sorts of cell phones who designed for teens who like to text, teens who like to go on internet on their phones, and teens who love to talk on a phone with friends. Cell phone is a easy, fast, and fun way to communicate with others. Students should have to right to do what they want. Also, talking texting, and do whatever they want on cell phones enjoying their free times and lunch periods do not effect others from what they are doing.

Over all, The first policy is the most suitable policy for the school, because students can bring cell phones to keep contacts with their parents to let them know that students are safely arrive school every morning, so they have the peace in mind to focus on their works. However, cell phones should be turn off during class periods, because it is distractive to the class, and keep others from learning. Also, students should use their cell phones during their free times and lunch periods, because it is a way to enjoy their lives without distracting others.

Sincerely,
