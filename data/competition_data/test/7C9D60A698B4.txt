The use of Facial Action Coding Systems mis a new recent peice of technology that is used to read human emmotion through facial expressions. In this essay I will be telling you why i beleve this is wrong and give you evidence and the downfalls this tech coulkd have.

Peoples emotionms are practically personal buisness of the person who is feeling that way it shouldnt be anyone elses buisness what he or she is feeling. It would also cost alot of money to aforrd the tech that has been built to run the algorithims "Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithims". That excerpt from the last pragraph in the artical tells me this must be very costly to use in a classroom enviorment. One down fall if this new tech also is "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal" this c ould cause problems with being able to trust computer programming to tell us the emptions of anyone because everyone looks diffrent and has diffrent facial expressions for certain emotions or what if some crys when they laugh or laughs when they are frustrated.

So in conclusion this technology can be very costly and may have a chance of ebing somewhat inaccurate and can be an ivasion of someone personal privacy. Hoipefully i opened some new doors to you and hekped you see this technolofy in a diffrent way than before.
