Education from schools are important for students so that they can take on the challenges of the future. School work can be overwhelming and stressful and having a summer break is nice to look forward to. However the work shouldn't stop because it is hard to get back into learning after a long break from school. School projects over the summer are a great way to keep the brain active and learning for the following year. Summer break should be a time to relax and have fun; however, learning is a crucial part of development. That is why I think the summer projects should be enforced and student-designed. A student-designed summer projects would allow students to improve on the skills they are struggling in and get help with specific subjects. Since the only person that knows a student better is the student, basing a project by themselves would be more helpful than if a teacher designed it. If a student was able to choose a project on their own, it would most likely be short, but reasonable. That gives the student more time to participate in activities that weren't possible because of school work. Student-designed projects allows students to get additional information that will strengthen their knowledge, and allow students to have more freedom.

Student-designed projects allow for a better and helpful project. One of the reasons why it would be more helpful is because students would be able to base the project on something they are struggling with. Many advance or regular classes are fast paced and it can lead to the student falling behind. The summer project would help the student get the extra help and information on the subject. Since many teachers have other students and lots of other work, it is hard for them to focus on just one. If a teacher designs a project for a student they dont know much about, it can be almost useless for the student to do because it doesnt have as much value in it, as if a student, who knows what to work on, designs a project. So having the project be student-designed, it would be better and helpful for both the student and the teacher. It would also be a more productive way to use the time given in summer break.

Experience is one of the most important things at a young age. Students need time to develop skills that are needed in the future, like working and other activities. Summer break an excellent time to work and develop those skills. If the project is student designed, it would also work around their summer schedule. They would get the learning that they need and the experience that is helpful. During the summer break, the students can go on vacations and other trips. Even though learning is crucial, taking a break is equally as important. The brain can only take so much information and stress before it is too much. It is always good to relax and not stress. If the project was student designed, it would help with the problem of stress because the project would seem more like a helper tool than a school assignment.

I think the project should be student-designed because it is beneficial in many different ways. It teaches students to be responsible for creating a project that best suits them, it allows for more freedom, and it provides additional help for more difficult subjects. All are great reasons why the project should be student-designed and I think students will benefit tremendously, even more than if teachers designed the projects.
