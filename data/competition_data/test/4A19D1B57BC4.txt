Summer break can be a time of rest and rejuvenation for many students. For others, it can be a time of learning and preparing for the next school year. This summer learning can come in the form of a project that is to be completed throughout the summer. Summer projects should be created by the students to give them control and independence, to promote creativity, and to cut down on copying and cheating.

First, students should be assigned a personally designed project to allow them to choose when, where, and how they can complete it. Many benefits can come out of giving students full control over a project. For example, a teacher could see a higher percentage of students complete a personally-designed project compared to a project that was teacher-designed because students can create the project around their schedule. Students would be given the choice of the topic of their project, as long as it relates to the class or subject . Students respond very well to being given control over a large project because it fulfills a need for independence.

A student designed project can also promote creativity and problem solving skills. Giving students the creative choice means they will have to chose not only their topic, but how they will research, put together, and present their findings. By giving this choice, students can be more engaged and their interest in the project will peak. From many experiences, a project with hard-set rules is usually less engaging and much harder for some students. The students can design their project to fit their learning style, rather than the teacher's. Students will be much more engaged and willing to do a project if they are allowed to add their own creative spin.

Finally, a student-designed project can help minimize copying and cheating. By giving students the choice of their topic, the students will most likely all chose a different subject. A student seeking to copy another would be out of luck because the teacher could identify similar projects. If students were given a packet full of questions or a rule filled project, it would be easy enough to search for the answers on the internet or do the project with a friend. A student-designed project can ensure that everyone will do their own work.

Although a student-designed summer project does have it's downsides, like difficultly of grading on the teacher's part and the need for very high effort on the student's, it is a better option. Summer projects created by students can give the student independence over the project, promote creativity and problem solving, and minimize cheating.
