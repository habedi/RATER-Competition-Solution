Dear principal,

I think it should be your choice to do community service. If some kids want to do community service it is up to them, but i don't think the principal should be able to make them do community service. It is a good thing to do but it is also up to you to do the community service. If your parents want you to do community service then you should probably do it, but if your principal tells you to do it, then it is your choice if you want to do it or not. If you don't want to argue with your principal then you should do it, but if you really don't want to do the service then you could try to convince him to letting you not do it. I don't think principals have the right to make you do the community service because, the principal is not your boss your parents are. Your parents should be aloud to right a note that says you don't have to do it but if your parents want you to do it then you have to. It is your parents choice or it is your choice not your principals, if your parents want you to do the community service then you have to do it but your principal shouldn't be able to tell you that you have to do the community service. Your principal is your boss in school and can tell you what to do in school but he can't tell you what to do outside of school like making you do community service. Your parents are your boss outside of school and it is their responsibility to tell you what to do and to tell you if you have to do the community service, not your principal's responsibility to make you do things that he or she wants you to do outside of school. So if you principal tells your to do community service you should have the right to tell him no and you don't want to and will not do the community service.
