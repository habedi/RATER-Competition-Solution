Homeschooling has become increasingly more common over the last few decades. Whether it is through taking courses online or sitting down with a teacher at home, many students have found success in this type of learning environment. All schools should consider implementing distance learning because it caters to the individual needs of students, allows for self-paced learning, and provides more time for students to complete extracurricular activities.

Nowadays, many people are realizing that the traditional public school environment does not work for everyone. Over time, more kids are developing social anxieties and fears that make it hard to attend school. Ultimately, these challenges interfere with learning. Students who suffer with social anxiety would be more comfortable learning in the security of their own home. They will be given the opportunity to learn in a calming environment, which will likely increase their grades and overall understanding of material. In addition, there are many students with learning disabilities who would also benefit from learning from home. Some students need extra help that they are not provided with in school. Even if all it takes to help students be more successful is a quick break every so often, distance learning provides that, unlike public school.

Another positive benefit of distance learning is that it allows for courses to be more self-paced. Often times at school, students find themselves doing work just to pass the time. When learning from their own home, students are able to get their work done fluently without wasting time. Likewise, the students who need additional time to review are given that opportunity as well. Sometimes in public school, teachers go too fast and leave students feeling confused and stressed. When learning from home, students are able to spend as much or as little time on concepts as necessary. This will help make sure all students are fully grasping the concepts taught in school.

Lastly, most students are involved in extracurricular activities. Kids participate in everything from sports to volunteering around the community. Many high school students even have jobs to help support their families or to save up for college. Most public schools last around seven hours each day. Then after school, students come home and complete their homework. With school taking up most of a students day, they dont have much time for extracurricular activities or hobbies. With distance learning, students will have a more flexible schedule. Many homeschooling opportunities allow for kids to complete their courses whenever they have time. This allows for students to spend more time doing things outside of school that make them happy. Some people may argue that public school is important because it is the place where students develop their social skills, however if students were provided with time for other activities, then public school would not be the only environment for social skills to develop.

Over the years, distance learning has, and will continue to, become significantly more common. Although it is not for everyone, all schools should offer it because different people thrive in different types of environments. Distance learning allows for students to spend the necessary amount of time on their courses and no more. As a result, students will have more time to send with loved ones or participating in sports and hobbies. Ultimately, students all over the world can benefit from distance learning.
