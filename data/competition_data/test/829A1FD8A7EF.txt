Is it a good idea for schools to use online learning for students that can't make it to class? for many reasons their are many students that can't make it to class,like if a student gets sick or has a loss in the famliy. There should be a way for the student not to fall behind, and there is online schooling. online schooling and video conferencing are great thing for the students and the school.

One of my friends Generic_Name recently had an injury while play lacrosse. Generic_Name is now not allowed to leave his bedroom beacuse of the injury was very serious. But beacuse of online schooling Generic_Name is not going to be behind on school he will just complete the work at his home with no stress. Generic_Name can rest assured once he can get back at it he will be right there with the rest of the students. Thats only part of the help online schooling does to help students learn

The other thing it online school isnt just for students teachers get sick too. My algebra teacher Generic_Name was sick with the flu and was not able to make it to school. So Generic_Name loged on to her computer and sent out all of the task they were gonna do that day. Now not only is that class still caught up with all the other classes Generic_Name was able to take a break and relax at home while not haveing her students fall behind.

Some people might say online school and video conferencing is just a waste of money its not the schools fault. But any amount of money isnt a waste if its for the wellbeing of our students and staff. if a student can make it to school good on them but lets not punish the kids that can't.

PRAY FOR Generic_Name   Â
