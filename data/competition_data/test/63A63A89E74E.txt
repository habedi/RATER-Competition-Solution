Dr. Huang and his collegue developed a way to read emotions. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face; all 44 major muscles in the the model must move like a human muscle. Eckman has classified six basic emotions. Thsy want to take it to classes rooms to read students emotions. I feel like that is a terrible idea. Let m explain why, I feel like that is not right if you have a student premission then okay, but for the students that don't want it it will unfair because th technology is still in the room and they don't know if you are testing them. Some people like to keep their emotions to theirselfs. I feel that it should stay that way. The technology isn't even valuable. I mean no student is going to be like yes im fine with you seeing all my emotions. Like what are you gainning on see the students emotions ? How much they hate or love a class ? Honestly I think this techology is useless. This is why I think this techology isn't very valuable...
