In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author describes how a new technoloy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The new software has been developed that imroves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The software is the lastest innovation from the Prof. Thomas Huang of illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam.

Dr. Huanga and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans. In the fact these humans can perform this same impressive "calcutation" every day. LIke you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. The Mona Lisa can really really bring back a smile to her face.

" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" Dr. Huamg predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." Those were some of Dr. huang predicts. The computer can write some simple instructions that can make Mona Lisa smile with different emotions.

While looking in the mirror:

* Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth.

* Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the coners of your eyes

* Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes.

In the fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My conclusion, this new technology that Dr. Huamg is pretty amazing. This system or computer is a good thing it can make people smile and it can make Mona Lisa smile. It can also make the students smile or they can know what emotionl.
