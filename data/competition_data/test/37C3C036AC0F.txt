Dear principal,

The change in school policy could be a good and a bad thing. One reason is that I think that not just people with B averages should be the only ones allowed to play sports.

My reasoning for this is that not all good athletes have an average of a B.

This could cause many problems for coaches, because you usually have to have a certain amount of players. If there wasn't many players with the certain average required then there wouldn't be a team. The good thing about changing school policy's is kids need to try harder and make there grades better. The reasoning is if they want to play sports they would keep there average up many think that getting a C average is just enough and there is no need to try harder. Sports a great thing for children to be in.

I think that you should follow through with your change.

Sincerely,
