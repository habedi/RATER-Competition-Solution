In the article "Making Mona Lisa smile"

talks about how they have a new system and it can detect how a person is feeling. This new tecnology can be very helpful for students. I believe it can be helpful to students because there are some people who feel depressed and it is complicated to tell if they are happy, depressed, or angry.

This can help students and adults to see how they are actually feeling because some people don't even know how they feel. Some students might say "that computer doesn't know how I feel" but the computer FACS(Facial Action Coding System) comes from a good sorce. The people who created "FACS" were Thomas Huang and Prof. Thomas Huang was from the Beckman institute fo advance at the University of Illinos working woth Prof. Therefore, they the system "FACS" is a trust worthy computer to identify your emotions.

This system can help students with their lifes. To demonstrate, in paragrapg 3 it states "Eckman classified six basic emotions happyiness,suprised, anger, disgusted, fear,and sadness." when a student is feeling depressed (no students should feel like that) a teacher doesn't know how the student is feeling out of the six basic emotions that Eckman descrided. Thus, the system will help teachers know how the student is feeling ;and if the student is not feeling good the teacher or the adult can ask why are they feeling that way and build a conection or a bond with the students.

Teachers can find this system useful because when they are teaching they can see if their students are confused or bored. To illastrate, in paragraph 4 it states " Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements" which means that using video or images is a new way to find out how people are feeling. Therefore, teachers can see how their students are feeling and see if their class is boring or not and they can see if their stuents are learning anything. This is an example of how this new system can help students and teachers.

All of these are examples of how this system "FACS" can help students and that is is valuable.
