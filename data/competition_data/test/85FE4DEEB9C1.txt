All our lifes we have wonndered what the future would be like, or what tecnologies will we have. This is a step closer to that world we imagine and wonder about. This I believe is a great step towards what we imagine the future will be like. Personaly I believe driveless cars are great and we need to do more test on this subject.

All our lifes we have wonndered what the future would be like, or what tecnologies will we have. This is a step closer to that world we imagine and wonder about. Driveless cars are in my opinion amazing and inovating. The fact that what we have seen on television and dreamed about is finally starting to come true is just mind blowing. We need to do more towards making this bigger. We need to get more states to change trafic laws so that more testing on these driveless cars. People are affraid of the things that might go wrong but that is why we need to be allowed to do more tests and fix what might go wrong. More states need to allow this. A lot of companies are manufaturing computer driven cars. These cars have a lot of different sensors and cameras to let the driver know what the car is doing and let the driver know he is safe.

There is more reaserch and testing needed for this but it will be big. The driveless cars are a great new thing. The world will seriously be impacted greatly by them.
