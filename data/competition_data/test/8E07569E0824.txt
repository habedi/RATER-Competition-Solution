After my high school graduation I worked in a grocery store and bank. Life couldn't get anymore boring. Then, my friend from school, Don Reist, invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat with him. Of course I said yes, I mean, it was the opportunity of a life time. In Europe, the UNRRA was hiring Seagoing Cowboys. After long and hard thinking, Don and I signed up.

It was the best desicon ever. I got to travel all over the world, take care of animals and have fun on board. The other cowboys and I played volleyball, baseball, fencing, boxing and other sports to pass the long time on the boat. That's what I loved about this job. A once in a lifetime opportunity became a full-time job for me. I got to see England, China, Italy, Greece and France. You also should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

In conclusion, Seagoing Cowboys opened a whole new world for me. Hopefully it will for you, too. Don't hesitate to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Sign up, today. Thank You!
