There are many advantages to limiting car useage throughout the world. Also there are many different countries all over the world, who have passed laws to prevent the useage of cars to help preserve the ecosystem. Others have passed laws to simply help the economy from harm such as smog or acid rain.

First off, cars are bad to begin with, cars exhaust lets off posionous toxins into the air. These toxins, which is posionous for human consumption, can leave many negative affects to the human body. Limiting car use can prevent lots of things like this. Limiting your car use can actually be a healthy thing for you and the ecosystem.

Secondly, I would also like to mention, that the usage of cars can also premote other dangerous hazzards. These hazzards such as smog can negatively impact the humans ability to see other people, or in more dangerous cases, other cars on the road. In places such as Bogota, Colombia have reduced the use of cars has decreased drastically. Due to their new smog laws violaters can be fined up to twenty-five dollars.

In some countries the useage of cars has decreased drastically throughout the years. Though the use of cars provide faster transportation, they are always not a good choice. To help save the world and its people the usage of cars could not be used alot.
