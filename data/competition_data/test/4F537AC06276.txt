The advantages of limiting car usage is that less gas is released, thus causing a steady, more healthier Earth. Limiting cars is completely world changing. Although most people arent in favor of the cause, they dont know the real effects of the gas that is produced by cars around the world. The gasses that are released from cars are very hazardous to the ozone, and can cause environmental changes if too much gas is released. For example in Paris, they had  a almost near-record pollution buildup, and since diesel is popular in France because of a tax policy that favors diesel over standard gasoline, the gas released from diesel was more thicker and hazardous. After a bunch of air pollution built up, they enforced a ban that would stop cars from driving for a specific amount of time to halt the gas buildup. If you were caught driving when the ban was active,you were fined 22 euros, (or in american currency, 31 dollars) and people the declined the fine, the authorities impounded their car. Paris was generous enough to allow public transit and it would be free of charge, but it wasn't too easy for the companies to budge because they would be losing money.

In Bogota, Columbia, they have already been taking action in this gas problem, by banning cars for a specific amount of time, but this is their third straight  year doing this. This campaign originated in the 1990s and was said to improve Bogota. They have constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths and have promoted bicycle use. A business man named Carlos Arturo said that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution" which is entirely true. Their goal is to get people to use alternate transportation and to reduce the smog that the cars created.
