Curiosity is a characteristic that is in everybody and sooner or later it forces us to explore and create new things. The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," says that it is hard to explore venus but he supports exploring Venus very well.

The author says that Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin and that it may once have been just like Earth. He says, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This could mean that we could find remnants of an old civilization that died many ages ago. We could see what happened to them and see if there is any other form of life still alive today. Even if people say that it can't be explored because the conditions on Venus will destroy the technology we send to it, scientists are developing new ways. Scientists are working with a very old technology with cogs and wheels because they will be more durable than electronics on Venus.

All in all the Author supported the study of Venus very well. I think that if anyone heard that Venus most likely used to be like Earth, used to have life on it, and could possibly still have life on it would want it to be explored.
