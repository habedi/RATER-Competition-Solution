In " The Chellenge of Exploring Venus" The author suggests that studying Venus is a wrthy persuit despite the dangers. Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becuase humans curiosity likely led us into many equally intimidating eneavors

One hink tha the author suggests that stufying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dengers it presents, is that many mission was unmannned and for good reason, since not spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

Another reason that the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers, is that. Aa thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more Challengingare the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 greater that what we experience on our own planet.

In conclusion studying Venus is dangerous, because the weather is too much for us; there are temperatures that our body can't support or recist. Also Venus is not touched down in more than three decades, so that can be very dngerous for humans to experiment Venus.
