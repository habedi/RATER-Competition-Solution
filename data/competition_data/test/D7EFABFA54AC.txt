The Dangers of Using your Phone and Driving

Recently, Georgia has passed the "Hands-Free" law, which states that no driver can use their electronic devices while operating a vehicle. Although it is a law, many people still don't obey this law. Many may think that they can multitask but it's not a very good idea. Drivers shouldn't be able to use their devices while driving for many reasons. A few reasons are that many other lives are at risk, they can get a ticket and it can cause insurance rates to increase.

Depending on how much experience a driver has, they might think that they can trust themselves to multi-task. One out of Four car accidents is caused by a driver who's texting and driving. When a driver gets their phone out and isn't really paying attention to the road, they don't realize that they're putting everyone's lives in that car and many lives out on the road at risk. Car accidents can happen at any time and drivers should at least try to prevent them from happening. No driver should want to be responsible for an accident that takes their or other lives away or pays the price for their actions.

Some people may think that they can't get caught so they continue to do it. Of course, if you disobey the law there will be consequences. For texting, while driving, the fine can be up to

$150 and up to a total of one point on the driver's license. To some people, the fine isn't a problem, but getting points on a license are way worse and it affects everyone. Once points on a license add up, it can cause suspension of the license.

After those consequences, now the insurance company gets involved. When they find out that their client gets a ticket for texting and driving, they will most likely increase the insurance rate. Depending on the insurance company, they will think it's better to just cancel the policy.

Everyone's safety is important on the road. No one should risk their life or anyone's life just to send a text or check how many likes their post got. If a phone call or text message is an emergency, drivers should pull over before answering. Personally, checking it really isn't worth it because you never know what can happen on the road especially when so many people seem to be unfocused and or rushed.
