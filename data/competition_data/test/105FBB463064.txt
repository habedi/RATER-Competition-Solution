I am not for or against this policy change.

I think its and good idea in some ways because it will encourage other students to bring their grades up.

But i disagree because some students and not very strong in terms of academics, but rather in physical activities.

I think it should be decided on how the student getting the C' s are handling this, as in if they aren't trying their best for their grades then they shouldn't be allowed to participate in the school activities, until they show some proof of trying.

To help the students against this change I would suggest extra credit things for them to do to bring their average up.

Like, test corrections, volunteering to help the teachers with grading work, or helping around the school.

A lot of students are capable of getting a b average but maybe need some bribing to bring up their grades.

If an athlete is getting low grades he should be threatened at least to bring his graded up. Instead of just not being able to play or do anything with the school at all.

If I was for this policy change along with other students, my reason would be that its a good bribe.

A lot of kids in school are sports crazy and would do anything to play them.

But we have to remember some students have less brains than they do brawn.

But any decision you make students will be able to handle.

There is always tutoring for the kids who aren't that smart, and there's always a way of getting students to try harder for what they want.

i hope you see both sides now and know no decision is a wrong one.

Us kids can always find a way to be happy, we can get over it if we don't get our way.
