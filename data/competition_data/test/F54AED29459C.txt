Dear Principal,

I believe that the first policy is better because some students need their cellular phones during school to do things like text their mom and tell them basketball practice is cancelled and they need a ride home or even to tell them that they will be staying after school for a test, to grade homework, etc. Students having them during free times is no harm because its not like they are learning anything during that time anyways. Also, they don't get them in class so its not going to interfere with their learning. If you catch a kid with a cell phone in class you could just take it away and after the second time the kid could lose privilege to have it during free times. Plus its giving students more responsibilities and they have more opportunities to use honesty. Using cell phones during free time is no harm because what if they need lunch money and there parents have a long distance number that the school phone cannot call. What are they going to do then? Go without lunch because they don't want to have to pay the school back or are to afraid to go up to the office and ask for money. Students will be hungry the rest of the day just because they couldn't get a-hold of their parents. If students cannot have cell phones at school ant all then what if they need them after school cause they walk a long distance or walk a short distance but still feel safe with the phone in there hand in case of trouble. Students use their cell phones during school anyways so why get them in trouble for it why not just make it alright. Students have been waiting for this cell phone policy to change for a long time now so lets just stop torturing them and give them what they want just this one time.

Sincerely,

A Convincing 8th Grader
