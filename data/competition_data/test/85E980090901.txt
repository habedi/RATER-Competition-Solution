Limiting car use could be a good thing, or producing greener cars that find an alternitive fuel rather than burning fossil fuels. The american society is built around cars, and as cars have only been around for a hundred years. we have not been interested in changing what they run on. Maybe we could find a cleaner burning fuel source so that we dont have to cut cars completly out of our lifes. Alternative means like electric cars and cars that run on solar power are out there we are just not mass producing them. the cars that are out and that run on an alternative means of fuel are to expensive for the avarage american. Oil companies dont want to see this switch happen to cars that run on alterniatve fuel because then that cuts into their budget.

There are cities that have cut cars out of their society completly, like vauban germany. were they are almost completly car free. You can still own a car there you just have to pay 40,000 for a parking space, which deters most people from owning a car. 70 percent of the population in vauban do not own cars as a result. Making the air in their city alot cleaner than their neighbors. Cities like paris and beijing china have some of the worst polution records than any other city in the world. Paris got so bad that they had to inforce a driving ban just to let it clear up. Cities like these have alot of residents which means they have alot of cars. Offering free transportation on some days might intise peple to leave their car at home and help lession the rate of polution that is given off.

Their are alternatives for now like car pooling and public transportation, but as the population keeps growing we are going to have to find another means of getting around greener. Once plug in and hybrid cars become cheaper there will be more of them found on the road, but for now we can try and cut back on our car use to help the enviorment. as more places become more populated the polution is only going to increase. In america however the main source of polution is not coming from cars it is coming from factories. which burn fossil fuels and blow them right up into the atmosphere. so we need to not just focus on cars we need to also focus on factories and trying to find an alterntive fuel that can power them.

We cant just cut cars out of our life but maybe we can cut back our use of them in our society, just so we can leave a better world for genorations to come. Alternative fuel is the answer we just have to start producing cleaner burning cars and more effiecent factories.    Â
