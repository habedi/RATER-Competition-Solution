Playing sports is a deal of fun. For example you get to spend time with your friends and play a good game. But if school gets in the way sometimes they collide so you should at least have a B average if your want to play a sport and represent your school. Here are my reasons why you should at least have a B average you should concentrate more on school and if you have bad grades your punishment is that you cant play your game until you get your grades up.

First and foremost you should concentrate more on school then sports. School is the most important thing in your life when your a kid because what you do now in school will affect you for the rest of your life. Five out of ten kids think that school is a joke and your there for nothing. What is more important sports or your future.

Second if you have accurate grades and your worried more about a game then school then your punishment should be not being able to play sports. Fifty out of one hundred students play sports and out of the fifty only twenty of them have good grades. This is a good punishment because playing sports is the least of your problems. The only thing that you should be worried about is what your going to do when you grow up.

Finally you should not be able to play sports if you don't have accurate grades because what happens when you don't have a job are you just going to play baseball in the backyard? So the question to ask yourself is what are you going to do when you grow up? The school is only doing this for one reason to better yourself in your future.
