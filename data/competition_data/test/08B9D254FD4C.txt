Dear Principal,

I would like to let you know that I think the best possible choice is to go with policy #1.

the reason for this is that we wouldn't break the rule because we know you would stop letting us bring our cell phone.

the free time and the lunch time being our only way to communicate is good because people would cheat.

One good way to keep this is to have a box next to the door and let the student drop there phone in there and go on with class so they don't get into trouble.

letting us communicate with one another causes us to be more quiet so we don't have to get all of our talking in one class and get the teacher mad and the student mad for getting in trouble over talking.

the student population would greatly appreciate you for letting us have our cell phone in school and you will not be disappointed.
