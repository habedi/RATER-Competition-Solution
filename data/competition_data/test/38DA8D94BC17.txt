Venus, sometimes called the 'Evening Star," is so seeable, that people can spot it by looking through a horoscope. Many people see venus as a star because of its sharp brightness, but venus is actually a planet.

Many people are against landing in Venus, because of the danger it could cause. for example, in paragraph three, venus is stated to be "Temeratured above over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." But despite all this, the study of Venus is a worth pursuit, even of all the danger it presents. Venus is the closest planet on earth, making it easier if people wanted to land. Just like Mars, venus is known to be an earth-like planet and could have possibly had oceans and supported various forms of like.

As more technology advances, NASA has a compelling idea to possibly land on venus safely. In paragraph five, it is stated: "NASA's possible solution to the hostile onditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray." This means that there could be a bump-like vehicle used to hover 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian. The vehicle would be a safe thing to use, because it is made for the rocky textured planet.

Venus is a planet that many people call the "Evening Star." Usually, it is so visable, because people usually see a sharp, brightness. It is known to be spotted easily by looking through a horosope.
