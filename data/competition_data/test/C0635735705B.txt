Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are going to change the cell phone policy at school. You have provided two options: allow students to use them during lunch and free time, but not during class, and not allow students to bring phones to school at all. Out of these two policies, i believe that policy 1 is a better idea. I can list tons of reasons, but here are just a few.

First off, policy 2 is a bit harsh. If students aren't allowed to bring cell phones to school, what happens if they're in an emergency. Also, phones are a way to communicate with friends and family, about how their day is going, or sometimes you're bored and you want to play a game, well, cell phones have that. I agree that you shouldn't be able to use them in class because they can be very disruptive, but taking them away entirely is just not right.

Secondly, I completely agree with policy 1. If students are allowed to bring them to school, and not use them, then I don't understand what the point of it is. But, when they pull out their new cell phone to show off to their friends in the middle of class, that could be a problem. One, it's distracting to people around them. It can make them look at the phone instead of their work, and then fall behind or get in trouble from the teacher. Also, the phones could ring in the middle of class, and that's a problem. The noise can be loud and disruptive, or the ring tone or whatever they have as their ringer could have inappropriate language. Who knows what's floating around these days. And finally, they can use it to ask for things. What if someone forgot their lunch that day. They could call up their family and ask if they could bring it to school. But, only during those lunch periods and free times.

My last reason is that during those lunch periods and free times, it can get a little boring. Especially if there is no recess because of the weather or some special thing that is going on. With the cell phones, you can do numerous things with your friends during those boring times. You can talk to each other. Also, on some phones, you can take pictures, or record videos and then laugh about it later. There are also games that you can buy and play on certain phones that can entertain a crowd. Aside from those things, sometimes if you get internet access, you can watch videos on certain sites that made you laugh, or had some good music in it with a cool video.

So, between policy 1 and policy 2, I would choose policy 1 all the way. It's better than policy 2 in so many ways and just has good ideas. whether it's calling up your parents to tell them to have a good day or ask for your forgotten lunch, or just talking to friends about what's going on, cell phones are a good thing. So, principal, it's your choice to make, but I hope you make the right decision on this dispute. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
