Changing the school policy to where you must have a B average is a good idea, but many students only have C averages. If the principle did change it, many students would not be able to play sports. A thing to remember is that if the principle did change it, the students who really want to be in the sport would probably push themselves in their classes in order to do better and be able to participate in the sports they wish to play. Sports are a big part of school. They raise money in concession stands, other students who aren't in the sport still go out to cheer on their friends, and the people in sports learn from it. I have done Cross Country in both seventh and eighth grade, and it has been so much fun. Although I keep an A average, I have friends that get B and C averages. Does that mean that only I should get to be part of the team? No, because those who get lower grades than I are still great runners.

Another thing to remember is that a C is not a failing grade. If students had lower than a C, that is when they should not be in the certain sport they wish to be in. When it comes down to it, I believe that grades are more important than sports. Sports are a thing I think everyone should be in, whether it be Football, Volleyball, Cross Country, or even Marching band (yes, that is a sport). If a student starts failing classes and are participating in sports, they should be taken out of the sport so that they can focus more on bringing up their grade. Then, once their grades are up again, they should be able to go back into that sport.

My father wouldn't even let me watch television if my grade went to a low B or C. I think he's part of the reason I keep my grades up. When I get all A' s on my report card, he smiles and tells me he is very proud of me. Therefore I smile, because if my dad told me he was disappointed in me I would start crying and that would ruin the rest of my day. Even if I see that I have a low C my stomach starts to hurt, because I know I can do better than that, and to see I'm a couple points away from failing makes me wonder how I could have let m grades so low. My dad was an A average student throughout his school-life, and that's why he pushes me and my sister to do better than our best and have us push ourselves to expect better.

I don't get money when I get A' s, and I don't get any new type of furniture or clothing or anything else... I get happiness, not only from my parents, but from myself. I don't have the best concentration skills, either, but I still focus my best to succeed. If I can do my best to pass my classes in order to do what I love, which is running, then so can any other person. Making excuses as to why you're failing won't get you anywhere in life. If you love a sport like I do, then you will do what ever you can to stay in that sport. It is better to get a B average, but if you can't do that, then at least try to have a C average. It'll be worth your time, I promise. :)
