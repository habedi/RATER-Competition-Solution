Dear, Principle

I would say no because to community service it's not like I don't want to do its just that their or things I want to do in stead of community service

I would do it next year or not even . It does take to much time like all day and I have other things I have to do and its just to much work if I had the time I will . People shouldn't even pollute that's why they say go green keep our planet healthy but these day people don't care they do it because they think it's cool or just don't care about what they stand in. Well their standing in their dirty featly garbage. It would be nice to help the community clean up for a while.

But to me I don't pollute at all I don't think it's cool i defiantly don't like it when I was a Little girl I helped in community service all over and it was kind of fun

I admit it was just around my school but loved it . Wee just have to GO GREEN!
