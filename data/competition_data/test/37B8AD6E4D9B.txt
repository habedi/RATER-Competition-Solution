Making Mona Lisa Smile is about this new technology knowing when we are mad or sad.

Acording to paragraph 4, 'the facial expressions for each emotion are universal". Also in paragraph 5 " you can tell how a friend is felling simply by the look on her face. Of course, the most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observed that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions". Finally, In paragraph 6 "the Mona Lisa demonstration is really intened to bring a smile to your face, while it showes just how much this computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confussed or bored.

This is why it is valuable to put the Mona Lisa Smile in the classroom for teachers and students.
