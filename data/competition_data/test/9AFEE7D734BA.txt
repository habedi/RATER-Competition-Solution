Dear Principal,

Students using their phone during class can be a big problem and i understand that.

i know that you are considering two polices at a attempt to stop the improper use of cell phones at school, but to even consider to not let people bring their phones to school is too extreme so please choose policy one.

What happens if we have a emergency?

What can we use to call the people we need to reach, we don't have our phones!

I personally walk home and my phone is my lifeline.

I may get a call from my mom saying that i have a dentist appointment, but i would have phone so i will cost my mom money.

I could get hurt while I'm walking no one is usually around me.

What happens if we need something for school.

We cant remember everything, we are human.

Our school get boat loads of important forms that have consequences attached if they are late.

If we forget to bring them in we can call our parent via cell phone and get them in.

Plus, it cost money to use the school phone, although it's not much money we still don't carry that around.

phones enable us to do so much we could never do with out them.

Although, our phones are get more entertaining and more advanced, they still help everyday.

The first policy states that we can use our phones during passing breaks and lunch so that is when we can use it for entertainment.

Cell phones are a necessity in our time.

they can help you get out of any situation.

They can get us through emergencies and homework.

so for
