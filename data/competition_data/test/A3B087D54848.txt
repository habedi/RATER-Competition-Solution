have you ever wondered whats lives beyond earth if we are able to explore beyond this planet we would know whats to come and could prepare for the moment this information gets broken to us.

Even though it might be dangerous it might not be such a bad idea to study it more if we learn more about this planet and gather enough information we might be able to make or gather the equipment to even explore this planet and who know what we can find we might find new minerals,materials,or even a different species.

It might be a bad idea to explore these planets that we haven't explore yet, but there are probably stuff that are on these planets that can help worldwide problems like cure diseases make better material or better technology, they may be our key to advancing but if we don't try to advance we might be stuck here facing worlwide problems.

Last,the author might not have a bad idea but it might be dangerous but its a risk we might have to take exploring these undiscovered planets that might be harmful but these planet might have the needs we are looking for to advance forward, to help us with our problems that are occuring today.
