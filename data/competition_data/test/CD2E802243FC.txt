the first policy is better because you actually get to bring your phone to school and most people in the world have phones and most kids pull out there phones during class and text anyway but policy one is the best policy because on policy two you cant even bring your phone to school and that's crazy about 75% of our school have cell phones so it would be best if they let us just bring them to school but overall i think policy number one was the best policy 1 is the best and I think that my school should change our policy because we cant have our phones out at all until 4:20 and that's when school is over we cant even take them out at lunch and that's crazy because its basically our free time so for our school to be so strict is not cool but i understand why we cant have them in school because it distracts us but as long as were not calling any one why should it be a rule but its the rule so if we don't like it then we are just going to have to take it but anyway i think my shool should try to consider policy number 1
