I think the Face On Mars is a natural landform because there are other landforms already like it on Earth, and there are other mesas like it around the Cydonia region. I think if aliens were on Mars I think we might have discovered them by now, but you can never be sure.

The Face is just formed by conveniently placed shadows. NASA wishes there was life on Mars becase they would benefit from it, so why would they try to cover up something that could get them a lot of popularity and money. Scientists researched this farther and released even better pictures proving it was just a landmass and not an alien artifact. People believe that the clouds could've covered up alien markings but that seems illogical because in 2001 they went back to the face and took more pictures with even higher resolution and found that there were no markings at all, meaning more evidence leaning towards the Face just being a natural landmass and not an alien artifact. It was just a mesa the whole time.

So there is a lot of evidence leading you to believe that the Face on Mars is merely just a natural landmass called a mesa, combined with shadows gives the mass a facelike texture. Lots of research shows you that the mass is very natural and not made by Aliens.
