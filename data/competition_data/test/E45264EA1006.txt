Phones and driving

Usi5ng your phone while driving is very dangerous because a lot of people die because of texting and driving. Especially a lot of teenagers who drive use social media while they're driving.

Which is one of the main cause for so many deaths not only in teens but in adults.

As social media continues to progress and now that everything is on the Internet texting and driving isn't the main issue. The main issue is that there is nothing that is stopping people from being on their phones in general. Phones in general are a big distraction and especially while driving. People will tend to look at emails, check social media, or just simply send a text message while they are at stop sign but that can be just as dangerous as well because as the driver hits the gas they are looking at their phones at the same time and then boom that's wen the big accident happens. This is a very common thing that happens with a lot of people who aren't careful enough to put their phones down and pay attention to the road.

A lot like drinking and driving many teens they can get away with texting and driving, but what they don't know is that being behind the wheel and looking at your screen at the same time is a dangerous. While recording yourself behind the wheel is another mistake waiting to happen.
