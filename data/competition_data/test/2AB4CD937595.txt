Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering two new phone policies. Policy 1 is about letting us, the students, bring our phones to school and being able to use them at lunch and other free times. While Policy 2 is not letting us have our phones at all while at school. As a student myself I have to agree more with Policy 1. Letting us use our phones during lunch and other free times would let us communicate more with each other. During class most of what we think about is probably what we are going to say to our friends the next time we see them. Since we have no time to coordinate where to go for free time with our friends we might miss them. If we could use our phones to text them we could met up. A friend that is sick and missing classes might want to catch up on work so they don't get too far behind. The friend at school could call them at lunch or free time and tell them if anything important is going on. Along with telling them about school work, we wouldn't want them to get too bored, now would we? Our friends are how we get through the day. They are what makes us look at the white board and say "I can get this. I can learn." When we are lost their the ones who put us back on track and the ones who show us the way. If you allow us to use our phones outside of the classroom they can do all of these things from across the school and I'm sure that we would do much better inside the classroom. Phones are the way that we keep up our friendships with those that we never see. I have a friend that the only time I see her is if we happen to go to the same place for free time. Once in a while we will run into each other in the hall and say where to meet but only like once a month. All her classes are upstairs while mine are all downstairs and on the other side of the school. Can you guess the way we've staid in contact? Yep, that's right, cell phones! To some it may sound stupid and cheesy but cell phones are what keeps our lives together. Unless you would rather put all friends together in one classroom, I think the best way to go is Policy 1.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
