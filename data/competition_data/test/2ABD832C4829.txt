My thoughts on this are that you should go a head with the first policy. This policy will help with students who may need to call parents for a ride, help keep the students from being boxed in to the people around them instead of somebody else they would want to communicate with, and it would help in letting kids be able to figure the rest of the day by asking other friends or family members.

To begin, this policy will help with students who may need to call parents for a mean of transportation. Some kids do not know if they are supposed to walk home or ride the bus sometimes. If this policy was in affect it would make life for some students much better. I know if I had to do this I would like to be able to use it if I did not know what to do at the end of the day.

In addition, it would help keep the students from being boxed in to the people around them instead of somebody else they would want to communicate with. Some people do not do well with others so if you give them the chance of communicating to anyone they actually want to you may cut down on the bullying or excluding. When thinking of this in my mind it would be perfect.

Finally, it would help in letting kids be able to figure the rest of the day by asking either friends or family members. When doing this it stops the confusion of people have to scream across a room to ask someone to do something. When doing these things it usually disrupts the teacher and other students who are trying to learn. When everything is a ease everyone mind will be at ease during the actual class period which cuts down on many things.

My thoughts are that you should choose the first policy. This policy will help with students who may need to call parents for a ride, help keep the students from being boxed in to the people around them instead of somebody else they would want to communicate with, and it would help in letting kids be able to figure the rest of the day by asking other friends or family members. When you are thinking of which policy to pick I know you will choose the right one.
