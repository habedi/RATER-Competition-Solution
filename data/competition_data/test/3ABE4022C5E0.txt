In this article, it explains about how dangerous it is to travel and explore Venus. It mentions how our technology cannot last more than a few hours on Venus. From what was described in the first three paragraphs it seems like there is no way that you can travel or explore the planet without any hazards. The author claim's that there is a way to travel and explore the planet without any hazards. The information the author provides to support the idea is that there is a way and its a worthy prusuit despite the dangers there are.

Through out the article after paragraph three the author explains all the ways that make it possible to explore and study Venus. He explains in paragraph four that since Venus is much similar to our planet, Earth, that we should look into Venus again and try to gain more information about the planet. It's the nearest option for a planetary visit so why not. The author mentions in paragraph five that NASA has a idea for sending humans to study Venus in a safe way. Their idea was to have a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above to prevent being near the hot surface of Venus. At this height it will be survivable for humans. This sounds very workable. The only down side is that this makes it harder to study the planet and its surface. The author at the end of the article says that we should be able to travel to any place and should not be stopped or limited by any dangers and doubts.

Many of the authors claims in the article were quite good and were quite reliable. He used NASA to back up his claims about how there is a way to travel and study Venus in a safe way and why we should. Venus is very similar to our planet and it is also the closest planet to us. Even though it might not be easy to travel and explore the planet. We should anyways because this will not be only equally intimidating thing we humans will have face. We might learn some new things that might to lead to other things.
