Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand your concern with students not keeping their grades up while they play sports however sports are very important to some people and they enjoy taking part in them.

I know that grades are more important then participating in sports but keeping a c average is what is required from all students so if students are maintaining a c average they should be allowed to participate in sports.

The students that participate in sports try very hard to keep up th

It's great for students to take part in a sport or athletic activity because they are getting a lot of exercise and helping their bodies.

When a student is athletic their keeping themselves healthy.

It's important for students to get their bodies active after sitting down in classes all day.

Through sports not only develop healthy bodies but we develop our skills as being a team member.

When you are on a sports team you learn to work together with other people as a team.

When you become a member of a team you are not only becoming team members but you are becoming friends with everyone.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you take my thoughts into consideration when you make your decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
