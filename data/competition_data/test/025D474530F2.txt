The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the class room is neccessary because the teachers could use this technology. People all over can use this technology maybe to even save a life.

Teachers using this technology can help by them knowing how there students are expressing there feeling to an assignment. like, da Vinci`s picture of Mona Lisa. the technology says that his picture of Mona Lisa is, "83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." If this technology can tell emotions just by printing a 3-D picture of someone then this technology can help a lot of people like councelors. Councelors can use this to know exactly how there patient feels exactly at that moment. This technology could help Therapist help kids, teens and also adults from suicide, or keep people from hurting them selves. This can help people and people can actually use this technology to prevent many things. Teachers that use this can know if a student is struggling and needs more help than what they are asking. Nintey percent of kids around the world do ask question but dont ask enough of them and they dont ask the full question because they think they might look stupid for aslking a question. In the world everyone has there own opinion but this technology can really be used for something good.

As you can see this technogy is neccessary. Not just for kids to have fun with an to play with but also for serious reasons. People all over the world can use this and maybe this technology can save a persons life. This is my opinion of FACS technology, and it reading students.
