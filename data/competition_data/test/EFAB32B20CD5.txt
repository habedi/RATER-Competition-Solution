I am going to prove that the face you saw on the planet is not a alien and that it is a natrual landform. On May 24,2001,"NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snappin photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormos head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camreas from region of the Red Planet called Cydonia."This shows how it all started."A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth."The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attenion to mars."This shows that everyone is going to go back and forth about if its a alien or a landform."And so on April 5,1998,when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time,Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC)team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orignal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site,reavaling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows that ther was no alien face in the planet in the first place and that it was a landform the whole time.
