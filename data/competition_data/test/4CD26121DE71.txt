Whats the Facial Coding System you asked ? What does it do ? how does it help ? there are many questions for this new software that was invented by Dr. huang. The FACS is a software that dectect the feelings that a person have at that moment from their muscles. Many people have more questions to ask about the FACS that will be answered later in the story.

"Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry". How did they find that out it starts off when the comuter creates a 3D model of the face and its speaks about what is going on throught that persons head. The software can identify mixed emotions cause each expression is compared against a nuetral face which is showing no emotion. Do you think that the FACS could be used in a classroom ? is it a good idea? I honeslty feel like it would be a waste of time because i dont see how determining feelings have anything to really do with school. I feel like its losing money when there are things that the kids could use on the laptop and computers that will further their education in being better in a subject.

We are all humans all of us make the same facial expressions not much of our expressions change from one another. By us just looking at a close friend we know when theres a problem when they happy, mad and sad so why would we need a system for it to tell us that. " most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication" says Dr. Hang so if we could have emotional communication can the comuters have the same thing. Communication is always key but having to use a system to detect a persons feelings when they could just tell us. The FACS in school I just dont see where does it fit in with education.

If FACS was to be in schools what would it be teaching children? will they find it interesting. the things that are taught in school are taght for a reason and a software that just shows emotions I dont see anything that the kids will be learning from that. I feel like if FACS on a school computer or laptop on a software it should be more of a activity than something they are just learning. I think the kids would enjoy for it to be a activity for high school it would be a big difference because people have careers and finding out emotions and what people are thinking would be a great idea to use FACS as a software.

"humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday" although we do have the same expressions when we do things but a person dont even know when their showing an emotion when doing it. only your close ones would really know how you would feel about something but moral of the story i feel FACS would be great for high school for those who would like to have a career that involves more with knowing a persons feelings. But other than that I do not think it would be very valuable.
