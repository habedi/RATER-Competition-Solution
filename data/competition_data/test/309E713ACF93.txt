Lets say it can be boring on the boat the whole time after the animals are gone, but you will still have alot of fun. When the animals are gone; the room that they were in can be turned into a game room were you can play vollyball, table tennis, read, fencing, boxing and many other things. All of these games will help pass the time, and make it seem like a week journey and not a month journey.

One thing to be careful about is the dangers that could happen. You could fall off the boat and into the sea,or if a storm hit the big waves could drown you. Always remember to be prepared and always be careful while on the ship at all times. Do not play around and walk on the railings of the boat, or then you will fall off the boat.
