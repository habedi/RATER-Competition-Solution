Summer projects are the bane of a high school student's summer. Though, if they must do one, then students should be able to do their own projects, because the project would be better suited for the student and projects would not be seen as much of a chore if they chose to work on the topic. Some say that students would be able to quickly finish the project, but thats as a result of them working on a topic which they have interest in, rather than something they care little about.

Being forced to do a project on a topic that you do not care about is the quickest way to have a project which is either just good enough to get a passing grade, or one which is obvious that the student did not care. On the other hand, if a student chooses his or her own project topic which they care about, they will likely work a little harder or have it done quicker; for example, if a student who enjoys history is made to do a project about art, they will do just enough research to fill the project guidelines for that A or B, but nothing above and beyond. As a high school student, I do not enjoy projects in the first place, let alone projects in over the summer. Which is why if I was made to do one, instead of being miserable doing something a I hate, it would be better to do something, which I already have a little knowledge on and enjoy researching.

Chores are something no one wants to do, just like summer projects, but you do not have a choice in whether you want to do either. Just because summer is a break, does not mean that students are sitting around all day doing nothing. Most high school students have summer jobs are play sports which they need to practice for, which is why when they come home, the last thing they want to do is work on a summer project which has a topic on something that they find boring: like theology. When doing something I do not like, I dread it and put it off, eventually just doing it a week or two before summer break ends. This is the same for many other students; they procrastinate and eventually have to do it in the end of summer. On the other hand, if a student enjoyed the topic, they would be more likely to not only separate the work correctly or do it in a reasonable amount of time; which would be over the extent of summer, rather than just the last couple of days while also rushing.

Over the summer, no student wants to still have to do work; it is called a break for a reason, but if a student must do summer projects, they might as well do projects which they enjoy. If not, they would dread the projects which are not suited for them, if a teacher chooses it by lottery; and they will simply just delay the project by procrastinating continuously until they are at a point where they have to do it. Even then, they'll do just enough to get by. Which is why students who must do summer projects should be able to choose what topic they want the project to be on.
