Dear principle,

I think that Policy 1 would be the better choice and her are my reasons. The first reason i think u should use policy 1 is because a lot of kid use the phone for many different reason's like for example kids use there phone's to play game , get on the internet, text and also call and many more reason's. My second reason that i think that Policy 1 would be a good use is because what if a kid has an emergency that the school can't handle then what? , but if that kid had his or her phone the could call there parent to came and solve the problem that the kid had. and my final reason is that it would be a good use because that a lot phone now got calculators in and a lot of mathematic equipment in side that can help you for math. In conclusion as u can see policy 1 would be the right way to go in the kids and also the adults part.
