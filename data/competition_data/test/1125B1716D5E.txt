First off that is not right to the kids of the team. kids need to get out more and communicate with others. Taking away the right to do that causes arguments in school. For example when kids want to join a team the coach say you cant join because your grade is too low. I believe it is right to not let kids play unless they are passing there classes. Kids are smart and they should show it, if your not passing u should go ask for some help, get advice, go to your parents and ask them to help u with homework, go home and tell your parents that your not getting what u are learning today in school. The kids might have a problem with it but you should always pass school. Sports are not going to get you into the next grade your teachers are there to help you out let them take you to were you need to be. I am in the eighth grade even i have trouble in school in science i had trouble but i had to bring my grade up so i can go to field trips with the band and UIL and solo and ensemble. I understand that if your not passing you think its not a big deal but wait tell you are 32 and you are still in 11 grade learning to respect adults to your fullest ability. I understand because in the 7th grade i was in athletics and i didn't want to get a physical at all but still if u join sports fist thing that should pop into your head is if i am passing all my classes, do i have time to do my home work, if not don't do sports it might seem wrong to take you out but look at the bright side when you get into high school they are not going to let u slack its nothing like middle school take this advice from me i have a big sister that told me high school is hard you half to grab life and take it to the fullest ability.

This article i am writing about might not get to you but i am sure proud of passing the 7th grade cause i was on the edge to failing cause i was all caught up in sports, yah i was the one that ran around on the court but i had mandatory tutoring for the rest of the year till the big test came along in April and this year it going to be harder. I am proud to tell you that school is something you might think that all it was is that u come to school slack and get in relationships and kiss in the hallways NO that is not why your here . Trust me i grabbed life and have been taking it along way now . I am proud to sponsor my school and hope that this advice goes along way and reaches out to that one kid that thinks your better in sports and doesn't do no work and failing class. Take this advice and go some were with it trust me you well go far in life if you do study, do your homework, pay attention in class and tell your teachers and parents when u have trouble.
