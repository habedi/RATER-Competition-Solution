Dear principle,

I believe policy one will be very nice to go along with. We students could most definitely agree with policy one for many reason. OF course we will have them turned off during class i mean we go to school we might as well learn something out of it. Its pretty ridiculous how even now we can not even bring phones to school! so we would definitely respect the fact that you would let us have the privilege to use them freely (only through lunch periods and other free periods).Maybe during a free period or lunch period we student would like to finish homework and don't have a calculater!? well, if you go threw this policy then kids could do some of there homework and not have to "leave it at home or forget to do it". Maybe a child will have like a die heart emergency!? as of now we have to pay a quarter no matter what!! But, if we can have our phones then we can use it for those times. I mean come on... we already have to pay for our phones in the first place we don't pay for us NOT to use it. I'm pretty sure that we can reach an agreement on allowing us for policy one.
