25 years ago something hysterical happen around Mars.

NASA'S spacecraft called Viking 1 was circumnavigating the planet, snapping photos of possible landning sites for the other spacecraft viking 2.

When Viking 2 was found, it was a shadow likeness of a human face.

It was huge, its length was two miles from end to end. The caption noted it was huge rock formation, but it resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

That does not mean it was an alien, it just means that thats the way the natural landform formed.

The "Face on Mars" has been everywhere from Hollywood films to grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

Very few scienists believe that he Face was an alien artifact, phtographing Cydonial became a priority for NASA and Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Septemebr and the year of 1997, about eighteen long tirinig years after the Viking mission concluded.

It says in the story that the team which is called MOC snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Vikings photograph.

Thousands of peoples anxiety were coming out when they searched the web waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing the answer.

The answer is a Natural landform, there was no alien monument after all.

On April 8, 2001 a war summer day in Cydonia.

Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"

said Garvin.

Malin's crew captured and extraordinary image using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Each pixel in he 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.

But as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times better and bigger that pixel size.

So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they where.

The picture actually reveals that there is a martian equivalent of butte or mesa landforms common around the American West.
