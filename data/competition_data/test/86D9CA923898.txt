Hi, my name Luke Bomberger. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War ll. I am "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."

When you join this program you will experince lots of opportunies. I will tell some reasons to join the program, just keep reading.

The best reason about this trip is that you get help people who were affected by World War ll. "Helping out on his aunt Kate's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not the dangers at sea." " Besides helping people, I had the side benfit of seeing Europe and China."

Travling was lots of fun also. "But seeing in the Acropolis in Greece was special." "So taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water." I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at Panamal Canal on hs way to China."

When we had time left over we usaslly spent it, will doing fun activites. "Luke also found time to have fun on borad, especially on ruturn trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed."

"Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped me passed the time."

In conlsion, I have now realised even more why why I like doing this. Now that you read this this eassy, I hope that you learned why I loved doing this and that you know a little more about my experince.
