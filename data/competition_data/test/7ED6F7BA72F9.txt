Dear, Principal

I agree with the first policy. I agree because i think that it is a fair deal that students can bring their cell phones but they have to turn them off during classes. It is fair because teachers wont get mad and complain about us using our cell phones in classes. I understand that it can cause a big problem on our free time but where i come from in my mind is that what if something happen to us or to the school. Teachers cant watch all of the children they don't know what will happen. All the teachers cant let all the children use their phone if its an emergency because i would believe that its over 200 students in the school that we are in. That is why i think we should be allowed to have phones and if we have free time you will think you can never get our attention if we are on our phones well i agree but its always not true. I think you will figure something out if you speak loud enough in the microphone, you will have everybody's attention. That is why i think we should be able to have our phones not because of free time but just in case of an emergency. I hope that you agree with me!!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
