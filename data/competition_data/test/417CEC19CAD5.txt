The author is talking about a new technology on the computers, well this new computer can be very helpful and interesting because the the computer can see if the students aresad, angry, happy, and bored.

The process begins whe the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.

Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another perso's facial expressions. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions. By the way, did making a happy face in this experimentalso make you feel slightly happy? well the theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. In fact the humans perform this same impressive "calculation" everyday.
