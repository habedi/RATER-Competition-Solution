Luke Bomberger had no idea how his life would change after gradutating high school. After graduating high school Luke Bombergers friend asked his if he wanted to go on a cattle boat. The reason they had the cattle boats was because World War II had just ended in Europe. After World War II ended many countries were crumbling. They needed the cattle boats for milk and meet to feed the people who had no home because of the war. I will list some reasons why he said yes.

A reason Luke Bomberger joined the cattle boat knew it would be fun. Another reason Luke Bomberger joind the Europe on a cattle boat trip was because he said "Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime." Luke went on his first trip in August 1945 when he had orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and the other crew members arrived on the 14th of August, 1945. It took about 2 weeks to cross the atlantic ocean.

While Luke was on a trip to Greece he had his 18th birthday, Luke could've gone to the military, but his draft board told him to stay. By the time Luke was dicharged he had been on 9 cattle boat trips, that is the most of a sea going cowboy.
