You should join because Seagoing Cowboysgives you the perfect opportunities to explore, you can have free time to play games, and if you join, you can help people that were or is affected by something terrible.

To begin with, Seagoing Cowboys will give you the perfect opportunities. Seagoing Cowboys will take you places like from China to Usa and even more! In case youve never even been on the ocean, this is pretty much your chance. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys, you will definetly be safe with us.

Furthermore, you will get some free time of course! On the cattle boat, you can have time after a long days work. Its just in case we are not working or far away from our destination. I think if you get tired during work this will be helpful.

Finally, you can actually help people with affection by somethoing terrible. in the article," A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" the author states, " It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins." the author also states," Luke Bomberger crossed Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pcific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II." this shows that you can help us help others

Perfect opportunities, free time, and affecting others is my reasons. You should come and help others too.
