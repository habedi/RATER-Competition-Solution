Why shoud students partcipate in activitys? Doing an activity it's a great decision, because the students will focus more in the activity they like the most and in the school, they will be busy and they won't be doing bad things, they will became good students, and staying home it's good, they can relax, but it's no good for their brain.

Some students like doing activitys, but not every students does, other students like going home and relax, and that's great, but doing activitys is more great, one reason is because, their moving a lot, they will focus on what they doing, students will have fun, they will talk to their friends, they will do what they like the most, for example sports, they could run or walk and at the same time they can talk to their friends, they can work on the year book, etc. Doing those kind of things it's very fun, they are always laughing, they communicate with each other, and almost all the time they are positive.

Another reason is, they will be busy doing good things, the students will be in a safe place, and their moms don't have to be worry about what his/her children are doing, some students make bad decisions, for example, being in a gangs, drugs, alcohol etc. Those kind of things are very bad for their health, they can go to jail, they could even die because of drugs, and when they get addicted to drugs is very hard for them to get out, and they can make their family desapointment, and being in jail can affect them in the future, some students might think that's a good decision, when really is not, they might think that doing those things can keep them busy, when is actually very bad in their life, they are doing very bad decisions.

Addicionally, staying home is good, they can relax, like sleep, etc. While doing activitys can keep them genergetic, positive, and moving a lot, but when they stay home they don't really do anything for example, they watch tv, they are on their phones, they don't really move a lot, some of them get a lit to be lazy almost all the time, and doing nothing is not good for their brain, they are not developing their brains.

In conclusion, the students should do extracurricular, because they will be, communicating with each other, having a lot of fun, they focus more in school and not doing bad things that can affec their lifes, and they could meet more people, and be friends with them.
