Do you think students should do community service? I don't therefore it'll take away the students after school activities. Students as myself don't want to pick up people trash after them and we have our own chores to do. And defiantly I think kids won't have time for that if they have homework or projects. Now let me explain my thoughts why students should NOT have community service.

First of all students have after school activities. Some students that do sports after school needs to work on getting an scholarship for there futures. Even though community service would look good on an college application but scholarships is affordable. You get in for free. If community service take that away from students then it'll be harder for students to maintain getting an scholarship. Some students can do sports or instruments. If you take that away from them then that's going to upset the students and kids can't do what they like. Doing this will ruin some students future plans. If they wanted to become something so they work hard on it and now there plan is not succeeded. Now they would have to change there plans for there future of something the students WON'T like.

Also, students like me have our own chores that we have to do. Us student don't need more work now. Doing this will stress and tire the students then in result they may come back to school lousy, grumpy, and tired to do there work cause of there exhaustion from working at both home and doing community service. I don't think PARENTS wouldn't like there kids going to school tired and exhausted from multi tasking after school. Beside elementary students is to young for all that cleaning. Kids go to school to LEARN not to pick up trash after people. This is the reason why I especially think students should have community service.

Most defiantly students do have homework. If you mix up community service and they have homework on that day, the students will not have enough time to finish there work or project, and then they'll get bad grades at school. If students get bad grades at school then they'll get in trouble by the parents all cause the principle gave kids community service. If students fail and then many parents will complain to the school about community service with upset parents. I don't think the principle will like that, Therefore no community services for students.

To sum this up, I recommend no community service for the students. Doing this well interrupt the students after school activities. No need for doing this, ruining something that students love and can make an future of. Students have there own responsibility at home and chores to do, So they shouldn't give kids more chores. Students have to defiantly to do there homework, why put homework behind and do community service if it's going to affect your grade? So this is why i recommend no community service
