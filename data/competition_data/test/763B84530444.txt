Using the Facial Action Coding Sytem is a great idea to have in a classroom. When a teacher is teaching sometimes kids don't understand what they are teaching about, but if they have an asasignment on the computer and they use the system it will help a lot of teachers out. If the student gets confused on a problem and the computer can read that they are confused and it notifys the teacher the teacher can go over and help the student.

In the classroom there are some students who don't like speaking out or ask questions because they are shy or don't feel smart because they have to ask questions but in this way they won't have to deal with any of that because the computer reads that they are having trouble. In the article it says that Dr. Huang could read how Mona Lisa was feeling just by a computer telling him. This system could also be a way to teach kids how to read how people are really feeling because in today's world no one can fully read how people are feeling.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang says " most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too" computers should understand that so they can read how people are feeling to make things easier. The computers in todays society hare very good technology but i think this would make it better. In most schools nowadays the students already have lap tops so this would be a great idea.

All schools should have this system. This system will help out students dramaticly. This system wont make them get out of there comfort zone to ask a teacher for help instead the teacher will come to them.
