Dear, principle

I think that helping the community is a good thing to do for the school. Cleaning up or picking up the trash from side walks, the grass, from rivers or lakes or anything like that. We could learn lots of things like math like picking up one plus two more makes three. We could do science by saying their are so many germs and different kind of germs and what could they be.

It is important to pick up litter so that the earth wont get polluted. If we don't pick up the litter its going to effect the earth. We could also take half that wants to pick up litter and let them pick it up for maybe a hour or two.

Then we can get the other half that didn't, let them do work until the other half came. When they did the half that didn't want to pick up litter, they could have their work finished and let them pick up litter for an hour or two. But if that wouldn't work we could start a club or a meeting after school for the students that wanted to pick up litter come and join the club.

If it helps the earth from pollution or anything bad happening to the earth i think we should help the community. I think we should do it so it wouldn't make our school look bad in any way. so people wont think that we don't care about our school. so i think helping the community is a good idea.
