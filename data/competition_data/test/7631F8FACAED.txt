I'm against it. i don't think its fair that they have to have a B average.

they should just let them play with a C average. what about if they really wanted to play that sport and they cant because they have a C averaged.

really don't think it should be like that. Its wrong in so many way to not let a kid play what they really want to play i am against it.

Why would you tell a child that they cant play their favorite sport because they have a C average. i think that shouldn't be. they would hurt the kids, feeling because he cant play what he been trying to get in for. keeping his grades up to play his sport. why would the principal do such a thing like that to kids like that, its wrong and mean.

i would really hate if my principal did that. what about if it was your favorite sport and you couldn't play it because you have a c average.

i would be so mad. but it would also make me work harder on making my grades better so next year i could play. i would do all my homework and class work and turn in everything so my grades will be amazing and i would be able to play my favorite sport.

i would be mad if i cant play my favorite sport. it wouldn't be the same if i didn't do what i love it would be bad because i wouldn't have nothing to do with my spar time. i would be upset and mad that i cant do what i love. it would make me so upset in side. sports mean the world to me. and because i have a C average i cant play it.
