Some ways to success can start when your young. I believe extracurricular activities should be incorporated in all kids schedule. After school clubs such as political clubs and science clubs help students think creatively giving them advantages in those subjects. Extracurricular activities also help guide people down their paths. These programs are giving kids extra knowledge in things they want to learn about, like math. NFL players like Aaron Rodgers did extracurricular activities like football to learn the game and he used those skills on his path, and now he is in the NFL. Although these activities can be time consuming and take away homework time from other classes, that is a small price to pay for something that can help your future so much. Like Aaron Rodgers said "Put in work now to have a better future later."In conclusion extracurricular activities can teach valuable lessons and help people with their future.

If you have free time and are looking to learn, extracurricular activities could be for you. They give you something to do at times that you could be bored. They have you learning at all times. These activities tend to boost your confidence. Learning about an activity giving you more experience in it causes some people to feel more confident when talking about that activity. Even if your playing a sport, your learning about the sport. These activities set you up with knowledge and guide you down the path of success. In conclusion extracurricular activities cause success and confidence.

Extracurricular activities can help kids build friendships. These actives help kids meet peers with common interest. This also allows the chance for these kids to learn teamwork which is a valuable skill in the real world. This can create an environment where kids might feel comfortable and be able to share their feelings with trusted adults or friends. With some of these activities like sports, this allows kids to get their needed sixty minutes of exercise everyday. In conclusion I believe that extracurricular activities should be incorporated into every kids schedule.
