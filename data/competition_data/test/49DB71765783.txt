Dear principal,

You have given us two choices for a cell phone policy. One of those policies has to do with getting rid of them completely at school.

So I wish to write you this letter informing you why most people need to keep their phones off and on. I wish to keep the first policy.

The reason why I chose to keep the policy number one is because some kids get bored of just sitting there learning and the want more freedom. One thing that you can do is to not let them have there phones during the class so you can say "yes phones are aloud in school but you're teachers will collect them as soon as you walk in. You will receive them at the end of that class." One example could be friends they get split up in all their classes and never see each other in the hallway or different times of classes. So they also can keep up on the other friend during lunch or if they have a free period to talk or text. My example could be that my RELATIVE_NAME he is in the other hallway at my school and I never see him other than at lunch and we both have a free period to just do nothing if we don't have anything to do but text or talk on our cell phones. Some reasons why I think that policy 2 is a bad thing is if the students have to keep in touch with their parents if they have something going wrong at home.

Thank you for reading this letter I hope that you consider keeping policy one with my reasons, examples, and my personal life.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
