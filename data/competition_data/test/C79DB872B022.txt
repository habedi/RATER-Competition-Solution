I think that the school should be able to require community service because it will let the student's know that they are doing something right. Because some student's are very incosniderate , meaning they don't care. But if the principal decided to have it, then maybe it will change there minds and think to there selves that they are doing a good thing. And sometimes when you do good things for people, then they will do good things for you. Even if your doing a good thing period. It should make you feel good about yourself. I know this because i do good things for a lot of people. By helping them through things, talking to them if they need someone to talk to, and if someone doesn't get what to do or why they should do this, i say because right after you do this , it will make you feel good about yourself. I know it helps me! The best thing to do , is to do community service like every other day. And besides it would put a good example on our school. What i mean by that is , that it will make our school look nice and like we have good people that actually care. Some people in school are very rude and disrespectful to the teacher's sometimes. And they really don't deserve it because they help us through a lot and they make sure that we get our education and they help us when we need to stay after for school. We all need school though because if we want to get through life then we need to get through school and college in order to get a job and a house. For the students that are bad , then they should do community service when ever they get a referal. Maybe that will help them understand what they did wrong and it will help them figure out for themselves that they would rather off be good. There is no such thing as cool. People are people and the kids that think there "cool" , then they probably don't want to go through life. Because the people that do call themselves that , are most likely the bad ones. The kids that don't pay attention and that don't care. But why not have community service? Nothing's going to go wrong. The only thing that will go wrong is if we don't do it and the people that are acting up now are going to just get worst. That's why i think we should have it.
