Dear Principal,

In the consideration of having the ability to allow phones at school or not has brought to my attention that this could be a chance to change a rule in our school.

High school students really consider their phone a main need in their everyday routine. Since they're not allowed at school many students get in trouble for sneaking around and getting caught playing with them on their free time. Teachers don't like the idea of having phones in school because they are a distraction to school work or other students. Many kids that are allowed to have there phones at school don't really focus on class work or the lesson, instead they ignore and want to hurry and get their work done so they could play on their phones. Also, they could distract another classmate doing there work if they are playing on their phone during class.

On the other hand, phones can be useful when your at school by contacting parents or guardians when needed, remembering assignments by setting a note or reminder on their phones, or even by contacting a teacher when absent. They can use them during free time or lunch period to talk to friends, but when the bell rings for class they have to be turned off until allowed to get them back out.

I would rather be able to have phones at school so if I got sick, or if a event was canceled, and even just to see how so somebody is doing. With a chance of allowing phones at school could make my day easier and never forget my homework.

I would gladly appreciate you looking into a possibility of allowing phones at school.

Sincerely,
