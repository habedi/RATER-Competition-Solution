To the Principal:

In the society that we live in now, school systems block the cause of kids using cell phones during school hours. That effects not only students but parents. Why is it that students are not allowed to use cell phones during school hours? Is there a specific reason why, unless so, they shall be allowed.

Cell phones, a teenagers best friend at times. Now a days, schools policies have made it to the point where we can't use them publicly so what do we do - be sneaky. In many cases this can cause issues. If we get caught, the consequence is that we get out phone taken. Not only can the student refuse to give up his/her cell phone; but parents may come to the school with very unkind words.

Many things can be done to prevent this problem such as cell phones being allowed during lunch and other free times. The student body feels as though as long as they are not doing any class work then they should be able to spend their free time freely. It's doing no harm to them or anyone around them.

Statistics show that 65% of students feel safer when they have a cell phone with them. Another poll shows that 88% of parents feel safer when they can reach there kids at all times. Lets just get to the point- it all about safety. Say something happens in the school one day, students should have a right to tell there parents; ecspecially if it's endangering their health and general well-fare. You wouldn't want parents thinking that something going on with their kid/s and they don't even know what. That could cause a lot of 'damage' to the school.

I fully understand that students may become distracted if they know they can use their cell phones in school but that would decrease the amount of time every teacher has to take out to scold a student and confiscate his/her cell phone. Its to my knowledge that the student body accepts that in the classroom, phone must be away and off. That gives them more motivation to finish up what they have in class so they can use it during their free time.

I hope that what I have revealed to you has an effect on your decision. For any questions, comments, or concerns; Please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
