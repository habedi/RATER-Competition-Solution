Dear principle,

I must say that i have to agree with policy 1 because I believe that students should be aloud to bring cell phones to school. One reason why i think that students should be aloud to bring cell phones is because if they need to contact a parent at lunch for after school reasons. Another reason is there is no problem to have cell phones during break or during lunch times. If students get caught texting in class then you can take their phone away but if the student is just using it in the hall either put away in locker or taking it out when school is over and they are walking out of school.

If students are to obey this policy then you can take their phones away and they can have there parent or guardian pick it up. this policy should be the chosen one because students can have a limit to using there phone at school. they are not to be able to use them outside of free time during school and if they do there are consciences. this policy also states that as long the students phones are turned off during class then they are in no trouble.
