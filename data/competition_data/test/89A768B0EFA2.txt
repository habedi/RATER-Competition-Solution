Hi I'm Luke Bomberger. I'm a Seagoing Cowboy. My life changed when i joined the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join the program too! Why you may ask?

You get to help people all around the world. The Seagoing Coyboys take care of the horses, young cows, & mules that were shipped over seas. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, & more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations

Relief & Rehabilitation Administration).

For exaple, my friend Don Reist & I went to Europe to help. It was 1945, World War II was over it Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

You get to sight see when you have the time. You get to take once in a lifetime trips around the world. It's also fun abord the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals have been unloaded.

The cowboys and I played baseball & volleyball games. We also did; table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, & games to help pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy opens up the world to you.

So you see? Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. Even though it requires alot of work. When it comes down to it, you have lots of fun & help a lot of people. Thats all that really matters!
