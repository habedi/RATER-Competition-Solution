A teens I think is good idea if some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attent classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Because some student don't have time to go to the school.

For example i learned more in my house,because i can work after take my class and made more money for pay my bills. I have more time for madse something in my house or play soccer with my friends. And i have more time to leran more and watch video and take all my classes online is more better for me. And i can pass more time with my family and friends and them i can play video game with my cousin. And I need work for pay room so i think is more benefit take a classes online.

For begining with this prompt. I think is more better, because i have more time to study and pass all my classes. and i can study more time in my house. I can work more and made money before study. And i have more oppurtunity for my graduation. I think if you want take a online class is more better for you because you have more to me all you want to do. For example if i want go to the mall after take my class i can or I want to work many hours i can to.

In my conclusion i think is more better if some schools give the option if yuo want to learn in your house or school. because is more benefit for you.
