They should not take the electors college away because some people need it and more then 60 Percent of people had put there lifes work into that.

They need all of the support they can get in this fight for the world its there world there trying to fight and protect from getting kicked out of the system. They deserve a right to this and in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election if we didnt have the college. In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few voters away from a catastrophe if it dose not hold its self together in the elector college .

The electoral college is unfair,outdated,and irrational. The best arguments in our favor is mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

The first time a vote will not win the national popular vote. yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral vote, but that was the first time since 1888.

In 2012's election for example Obama recived 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percdent of the popular votes cast for him and romney.

The electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel. This is why we should keep or lose the college electoral for big changes and its like the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates- as we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states.
