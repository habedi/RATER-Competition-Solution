Hello I am a student at your school and i think that community service is great. Some of my friends don't want to do it, so i came up with a plan to help both sides get what they want. The kids that are out here cleaning up the streets are doing a wonderful job but we need more support. If the people that are saying the don't have enough time to do community service because of sports ,should help out kids in the neighborhood stay out of trouble. They could go on the field or in the gym and play after the practices are over. People who are in band could perform a concert for the people in the neighborhood .They could also raise money and build a new park and plant some new trees , the kids could help. I will help you and the staff to encourage other students to help the community but donating a little time for a very good cause. Not everyone agrees that this is the best way to help out but when they see how good the community looks after we are done with our hard work the will believe that it is possible for change if every one chips in. I think this plan will help or community and change how people treat our environment .

Hopefully real soon we see some changes in our community and it will get better. I think you should try and make every student do something to help us out , thank you for your time.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
