To The Editor,

Kids with a grade C average should not be able to participate in school sports. People with a grade C average will just have to work harder. That means putting in more hours of studying every night and managing to get good grades on work in class and doing well on homework, or at least doing your homework. That is okay. Grades are better than sports. Doing a sport like Cheer leading, Soccer, Tennis, or anything won't get you anywhere in life. Well of course if you are a football player you can make it to the NFL. But what if your not good enough to be in the NFL? At least you will have a good education to get enough money in life to raise a family, or at least just take care of yourself.

From looking at a grade C average kid's point of view it might look unfair, but from people with a grade B average or above, they probably find it fair. They work really hard every day and night to maintain there grades. When they go to college they can take classes in a sport and something else too, so if there Football, Cheer leading, Basketball, or Soccer career doesn't work out, then there other career will.

You can only do sports with a grade B average or above changes in a lot of schools, we will have a lot more "smarter" people. Maybe the kids will realize that school is a big part of there life, it will help there future. Now what if this doesn't change in schools? Well, people might not be as smart as other schools who do this. The grade C average people will think they don't have to work that hard and will slack off because they don't have to have grades above C' s, as long as they don't have a grades like D' s and F' s.

This may change many things at our school. Your kids, and my classmates will me more educated. Also parents with kids from other schools will recognize your educated kids with grade B averages and have there kids transfer to our school. Not only will we be making more money, we will also have more people for all the sports teams. We will have more players and a better team. This is why changing the school policy to students may only participate in sports if they have a grade B average or higher.
