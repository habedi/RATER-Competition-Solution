As technology advances, humans find themselves wondering whether it is helpful or if it hinders humanity. According to Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, computer software is now able to detect emotions in facial expressions. Although the software could help notify teachers when the students feel confused, this software could also make students feel insecure and violated. The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in the classroom.

Dr. Huang believes that his new software could inhance the classroom setting. It would "recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson," (paragraph 6). However, it is healthy for students to have human interactions with a teacher. Also, having the initiative to speak up if they do not understand something is part of becoming independent. School prepares kids for life beyond high school by giving them the freedom to speak up and to make their own decisions. Placing a Facial Action Coding System in the class would not help solve the need for students to learn how to live independently.

In paragraph two Dr. Huang states, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too." I strongly disagree with this statement. Being able to express ourselves and being able to interpret things in different ways, is in our human nature. If we, as a race, should expect to rely on a computer to detect our emotions, humans would become robotic. The beauty of human nature is being able to see through peoples' emotions and forming different connections. Taking away any room for interpretating peoples' feelings would also take away the mystery and joy in life.

Just as nobody can read thoughts, our feelings should also be kept private. By adding a computer system that detects emotions in every classroom, students would not have the privacy they deserve. They would never learn how to live independently and this system would not prepare the students for life beyond school. Finally, the need for human interaction is constant. Humans need to be able to communicate face-to-face and have the freedom to interpret things differently. This open communication is what creates bonds and friendships between people. Without it, humans would not be able to enjoy life.
