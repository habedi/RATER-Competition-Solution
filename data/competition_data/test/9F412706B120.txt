Is there a face is on Mars? I would say no, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact. There are shadows that can make it seem like a face ,but shadows can alter thing appearnces. April 5th, 1998, and April 8th 2001 have clearer images that can prove that prove that it is also not alien. Unlike the photos of the Viking 1 in 1976 ,which were older and were less clear. So the Face is not real because of, the later more clearer images prove that it is not, and shadows can alter one's apperance.

First off, the Face on the isn't a face it is a rock on Mars, that had shaows that made it look like face. People and imgaes can come about blurry ,and may looklike something else. Also pixels also can help make things seem like they are not what the they are. Like the picture in April 8th, 2001 pixels made it look clearer. A compasrion can be shared of the 1976 picture to the 2001 picture, "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"(10). There is comparaion toeach photo that was taken and as time went on it got clearer and showed less of a face. Which makes it more of reason it is not an ailean artifact.

Next, on April 5th ,1998 after the 1976 Viking picture of the face on Mars became a hit. NASA wanted to go take another picture ,because people keppsying it was made by aliens,it was difficult though. After NASA had gotten the photo though,it was more clear, which again proves that it is not an alien artifact. Even in the passage it states about it ,"Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tne times sharper than the origianl Viking photos"(7). After that it was on the web people realized that it is a land form not a alien structure. So it is a fact that it is not an alien artifact.

Finally, On april 8th ,2001, people still were blieving that alien made the landform. So NASA snapped another picture, in the passage it states "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view"(10). This mean they had gotten a good angle on the Face. And the picture was more clearer again. They had proven to the world that the Face was not alien. It was a landform.

My oppionent might state to me though that we did not see the real deal on screen just with a picture. They could of had edited it to make not alien. That is true but in 2001 they didn't have good editing system unlike we do today. So that image can not be really edited.

In conclusion, the Face is not alien the images of April 8th, 2001 and April 5th, 1998 can prove this. Also there are not editing system theat were really good to photo shop back then, and it had been proven many times by NASA that it is not.
