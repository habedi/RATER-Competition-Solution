Some schools are offering online learning as an option for students to attend class from home. There is an ongoing debate on whether doing online classes or doing traditional learning is most beneficial. There are those who agree that working in a classroom is most beneficial but this is not true. Although some may disagree, doing online classes are more beneficial than doing the traditional learning in a classroom.

There are many reasons as to why online classes are more beneficial. One reason is students can be more comfortable while they do work, meaning they get enough sleep so they can pay attention. Additionally, they dont have a specific time limit to do work at home vs when they are at school so they do not have to stress over getting it done in time as much. Furthermore, some students have lots of work around the house or have multiple jobs so having online classes means they can do their work when they can.

There are additional reasons as to why online classes are more beneficial. A reason being is, they are more willing to do work due to the flexibility of doing work online because some students have a busy life at home with chores and jobs, so they get their work done when they can. Additionally, they have access to the internet for specific questions, and if they can not find it on the internet, they will usually email or message and ask the teacher themselves. Finally, online classes are more beneficial because students who get sick do not have to worry about missing assignments and do not have to worry about attendance.

Although some may disagree, doing online classes are more beneficial than doing the traditional learning in a classroom. Online classes are most beneficial due to students; being more willing to do work, can do work whenever they possibly can if they have a busy schedule, and they do not have to worry about missing work and class if they get sick. Ultimately, online classes are more beneficial than classroom work for students due to the flexibility of the classes.
