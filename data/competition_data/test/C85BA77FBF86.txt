Should students create their own summer project or should teachers create the project ? one agrees with teachers creating the project by assigning each individual student to a project that best fits them and see which spot they have most difficulty in and have them do a project on that one so that way they can eventually master that subject. Another reason is because students often like to take the easy way out so they would pick the project that would seem very easy and that would prove that they actually understand if they do it on something that is fairly simply and easy. Also think its a great opportunity to get students on the right track for college because sometimes college professors give you projects over break and it is due when you return .

The teachers creating the project sounds like the more responsible idea because when in school students tend to try and take the easy way out and give there self a very simple project which wouldn't really show that they actually learned anything however, it will just show that they are capable of doing a task that isn't hard to do . From my personal experience a few years ago my teacher Mrs. Generic_Name told our class we were allowed to choose any project we wanted using the scientific method so i decided it was a great idea to do a tornado i put two soda bottles together duck tap it and put water inside so when you shake it up it creates something that looks like a tornado. Now that i look back at it i realize that wasnt a create project to do because it didnt really take any hard work or effort ; my teacher graded it and she wrote a note which she said " Please put forth or effort" i received a c on the project. This is why i think teachers should assign the project so the students that would take the easy way out wouldnt set their self up for failure.

One believes if the teacher assigning each individual student to a project that best fits them and see which spot they have most difficulty in and have them do a project on that specific one it can help students become better with school and pass more classes. A prime example would be if a student was having trouble learning about the great depression the teacher would create a project on that specific subject and basically allow the student to do research, take notes, and a summary in his/she own words and also create a ten question quiz for a student to take. Therefore when they return to school it will be the first project grade in the grade book so that way the students wouldnt think they have done it for no reason.

Teachers designing students summer projects will prepare them for college, Its a great opportunity to get students on the right track for college because sometimes college professors give you projects over break and it is due when you return . A personal experience for me is when my older sister Generic_Name had a project from her sociology class and it was due the third day back to class i asked her " Why do you have work its summer" and she replied " college is why different from grade school , we even have projects on winter break". Thats when i then realized college is a lot of work and one should prepare their selves for. Which is why i chose the teachers to create the project because it will help the students out on the long run.
