He tells us that venus shows signs of once having life and watter because of all the hills and mountains and valeeys and craters. and since venus was the second earth like planet it makes sense since earth is home to all these life forms and all these metal and materials. and the examples are scattered through out the article and are actually very fascinating and cool because its weird to think other plnets couldve helped life forms other then earth itself. this article was pretty fun and im so glad i got to read it and learn from it. but the thing about this is i learned so much more about venus and what it is like on there with the sulfur acid and the hot temperatures and the prssure on it and how a human would die instantly but how scientist are finding ways to look at the planet without anything getting destroyed or damage. life is so amazing if you rell just stop to look at it and have time to realize how lucky we are to have all these things next to us in our own life and what we will have in the after life in heaven with God himself and how everything we do will pay off and we'll have endless peace and hope forever.
