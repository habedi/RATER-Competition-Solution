It is a fun job to have.

you get to see the world.

You can have fun on the ship on the ride home after you delivered the cattle.

You will have many friends to ride with you so you will never have a bad time.

A reason for you to join the seagoing Cowboys is it is a very fun job.

If you had friends on the ship you could have fun all the time.

You could play all kinds of fun games with the people on board the ship.

After you drop off the cattle food and supplies what are you going to do.

Well all that space that the animals were in is now open for baseball game.
