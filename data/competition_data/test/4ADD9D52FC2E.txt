Cell phone policies are always an issue in schools around the U.S. In my opinion schools should ban cell phones. Me being a student myself I know exactly what students would do. Students would have the temptation of bringing their phones to classes which don't allow kids to have their phones, they would be a cause of distraction, and detract from a child's educational time.

Kids spend more time on their phones than studying. If phones were allowed in the school during free periods kids would be more likely to bring their phones to classes that aren't free periods. This would cause more kids to face consequences with the administration. If kids traded their phones for books kids would be more educated.

Phones are distracting and everyone knows that. If you were to allow students to have phones during the day it would cause more distractions within a day that don't occur already. Phones are always an issue and will always be an issue. As a student I need to practice what I preach because I am one of those kids who need to trade my phone for a book.

Besides being distracting the phones would also detract from someone's learning. Instead of concentrating on school work kids would be focused on when they would get to use their phones. It would most likely lower kids' grade point averages. It would be an even bigger issue for the country then. So why not stop it now.

Although it would be nice to have the privilege of having your phone during the day, I am against having your phone during the school. Many kids would object to my response but phones are tempting, distracting, and detracting.
