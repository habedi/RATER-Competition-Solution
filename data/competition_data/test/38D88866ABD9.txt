Dear Principal ;

I'm asking you to change the school policy. I think it unfair to not let children participate in Sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Sport is a wonderful activities for kids to do. At school or after school , it wrong not lets kids be in sports because of there grade at school.

Many students have as their grade. Letting kids enter sports with at least an grade C , encourages kids to keep their grades at least to a C. Witch better way to have kids play sports after school , than watching t. v or gaming video games. Kids would be better at school and will have more interest. Will spend their more time playing sports. Kids would get together and will get along more. Will be more friendly to each other. Behavior will decrease due to sports.

It will be a better environment for kids in School. For this reason I think you should change the policy for the participate in sports. Kids will try their best at school and will not lower their grades. School will be a better place for students. More people would get along and be more kind. Would this be the best for us ?

Sincerely,

Your student STUDENT_NAME
