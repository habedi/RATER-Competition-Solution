Have you ever had two tests, a project due and stayed up all night to finish work just to get up and do the same process again? If your answer to any of those were yes, you were probably a high school student. A solution to this tiring routine is distance learning. While some people are opposed to distance learning because they believe it changes the quality of education, distance learning can be extremely beneficial to students. Schools that offer distance learning are benefiting the students by keeping them safe, allowing students to have their own itinerary, and will help reduce student's stress.

The first reason distance learning will benefit students is safety. People have germs; when a bunch of people with germs get together, it brings a risk regarding public safety and health. If students stay home and attend classes online, it makes it harder to spread diseases, especially in situations where the diseases are airborne. One example of why this precaution would be good in today's world is the Corona virus. This virus can even be spread through air conditioning, by keeping students at home where they can continue to learn but stay safe is the best way to keep the health of the students intact.

Another reason that distance learning is the best option for students is they can work on their own time. When students can make their own itinerary, the quality of their work will improve. By allowing students to pace themselves can help with breaking down work and completing it all, without the stress of sitting in class and being assigned one thing after another all in a single class period. Every student has their own needs and way of learning, instead of lectures if students could get the material and learn it on their own, it would allow them time to focus on the things they don't know and get a more personalized education. Distance learning also provides students with learning in an environment school doesn't, an example is doing work on the patio on a nice day.

The last reason distance learning will improve the education of students is stress relief. There are so many different stresses students have to worry about, grades, clothes, other peoples opinions... All things that will not matter in ten years (except for the grades) however, these things can get distracting. By bringing the learning out of the classroom and into an environment where students can focus on the learning part of school, outside of school, students will be able to complete their work without all the extra. Creating a stress-free environment outside of school where students can balance school and life would be extremely beneficial to the overall school experience.

In conclusion, distance learning has many more pros than cons. The standard eight class periods everyday has been around forever, it is time for a change with new ideas. Giving students the opportunity to stay safe, pace themselves and reduce stress is something that needs to be at least an option for students everywhere.
