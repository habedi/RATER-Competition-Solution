Summer projects are something that students aren't looking forward too during the summer. Summer supposed to be a time of relaxation and fun. The idea of having to complete a project designed by their teacher isn't very exciting for students. Most students complete their projects during the first few weeks of the school year and not over the summer, when their supposed to be done. To prevent this and to have the students learn something new that they enjoy, summer projects should be student based. Summer projects for students should be student directed for the purpose of , different student interests , more participation during these projects and lastly for the over all enjoyment of the students.

Students different interests give them primary reason as to why they should be able to have student designed projects. When a teacher designs and assigns a project their are always two different responses from the students. The first response are the students who love the assignment and cant wait to get started on it and the other response from students are the ones who hate the assignment and it makes them want to go to sleep. Everyone has different interests and different passions and in order to enjoy a summer project it would help if the students were to choose what they were researching or doing.

Teachers love when most or all of their students complete their assignments. If students were able to choose their projects the participation rate would be higher. Speaking from experience most students including myself dont complete their summer assignments and or projects until school is in session. Most of them don't have time or just are simply not interested. This makes the participation rate roughly 20% maybe a little more or a little less. If students were able to design these projects the participation rates would increase and the students would be learning over the summer and better prepared for the teachers beginning of the year plans.

School is supposed to be about learning but it is also important that the students enjoy what they're learning. When students are given the option of choice it automatically brightens them up. It helps the student become more engaged and motivated about that theyre doing. That's very important especially when it comes to assignments over the summer and or assignments in general. Over the summer students tend to have no motivation to do anything related to schools work as it is our big vacation time. Again it is crucial that students enjoy what theyre learning.

In conclusion, it is important that students keep theyre minds fresh and continue to learn over break, because of this they should definitely have a choice in designing their projects. The more projects completed over the summer the better it is for the teacher and the student. If the projects are student based they can base their lesson plans for the beginning of the year and the students can make sure they chose a topic they enjoy and have it completed by the start of the new school year. Therefore , students should have the option of creating their own summer projects , this benefits everyone. When everyone benefits everyone is happy.
