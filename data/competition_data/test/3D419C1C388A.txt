Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure that students learn throughout summer break. Teachers should design these task so that the projects will actually help students retain and gain knowledge and there will also be exponentially more organization if a teacher were to create the projects. Some would say that students should design summer projects, but there is a great chance that the project the students make will not be focused on academics.

To initiate, teachers should design summer projects because it will allow students to retain and gain information. Schools that allow the students to decide on what they should learn and review over break come to the conclusion of students returning with very minimal knowledge. That leads to the teachers having to spend weeks or even days reviewing! To illustrate, when I was in seventh grade, the teachers decided give the students the freedom to choose what the summer projects should be. It became extremely chaotic and did not help whatsoever. We were forced into a multitude of weeks of spiral review because of that foolish decision. Also, teachers go to college specifically to learn how to educate students in the best way possible. Therefore, they have a lot more experience in lesson planning and teaching in general, so it should absolutely be teachers that create summer project that would be the most beneficial to us.

Furthermore, a teacher, that has far more expertise and credibility in educating, will have a greater sense of organization than a student would. Teachers easily spend hours of their days making plans and lessons for students, so they clearly already have the capability to make the summer projects a lot more thorough and precise with the learning material. Take a look at a teacher's desk. There will be a grand amount of binders, folders, notebooks, and so many other items they use to organize their work. All of their work is categorized to the smallest detail to help make the lessons they create be the most beneficial possible. Now take a look at an average student that has a singular binder with papers shoved everywhere. I can almost guarantee you they will then be searching, for what feels like an eternity, to find an assignment somewhere in the midst of the labyrinth of crumpled papers. This is exactly why a teacher should be the one who designs summer projects.

However, there are people who fully believe that summer projects should be student-designed, but that could not be any farther from the truth. If a student were to create their own summer assignments, then there will most likely be no focus towards academics. The overwhelming majority of students would take the easy way and make their projects be as minimal as possible, so that they could go back to what they wanted to do. Once again, students would come back from break not knowing any more than what they did before. If a teacher designs it, they could have the project spread out through the break to make it not as cumbersome. Then the students would retain the information from the projects rather than them rushing to complete it all at once just to get it over with.

In conclusion, teachers should design these tasks so that the projects help students keep the information that they gain, teachers are also a lot more organized because of the experience they have, and the educators would be capable of making the summer projects a lot more academic than the students.Â
