First of all, if i were to inform citizens everywhere about the advantages of car usages, then i'll say this. we find ourselves to go to many different locations by car each day, and what i mean by this is that it is an advantage. while there are many countries who claims that cars are an advantage to us, there are a certain few places and citizens who want to make a change to this. By changing, they mean getting rid of or forbidding the use of cars. to many people, the first step to this is to forbid the uses of street parking, driveways, and home garages.

Even though this makes a bit of sense, i believe that a good reason for doing this would be because of the harmful fumes that cars release that pollute the air that we ourselves breathe in. there is also proof for this as well, for example, It's said that in Beijing, China, is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. this is a shocking fact. although we recieve this devastating news, i believe that we can make a no-polluting world by not using our automobiles for the time being, i can say that although this might not permenantely make the air cleaner, but we can if we just prevent ourselves from using our cars.

Next comes this, we are also aware on how in Bogota, Colombia, that there is little use for cars, since they are only permitting the transport of buses and taxis. however if a violater is caught driving his own vehicle, that person will recieve a $25 fine. there are even a number of people who have claimed that it's a great way to take away stress and lower air pollution. and if this keeps up at an average pace in the next few years, Bogota, Colombia will be confirmed as a clean and non-polluting place.

Then comes a known fact of where people are starting to least often drive cars over the past few years, and this has been proven true since many citizens are realizing that it has to be the fact alone on that people are less likely to get their licenses or that they may be dealing with a bit of money trouble, and that the unemployed are less likely to work any longer.

Lastly, as it comes all down to these facts, i still believe that we may one day drive our automobiles without doing anything harmful to our enviornment, and at the same time, our automobiles are being useful every single day, since it is another way of getting around to places in where we need to be. such as jobs, going to school, and many more. it may be difficult to believe my opinion on this, but it will get much more simplier as it goes on to progress itself.
