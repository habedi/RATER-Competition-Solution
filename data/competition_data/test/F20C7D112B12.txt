Generic_School is a school with about one thousand kids or more its going to be verry hard to asssigned a after school activity to all the students especialy like me. After school I hav to go a pick up my little sister and nobody els can and I know tat there re other people in the school that also have things to do after school.

One way we can make it so at least a resoable amunt of people stay afterschool is tuters for kids and also they can makes new clubs. To make a new club a student has to have at least six students that want to join the club but there also has to be one adult supervising the students. When the club starts it is going to have a place to meet and a scedual or els all the other clubs might want to go to the computer lab but only one can.

When you create a club it has to go into a catigory science, sports, office, or just play. When someone desides to create a new club before evrything a club thats in the office catagory has to deside what catagory it goes into and if its apropriet of they need equipment and all that stuff they also choose where the club will be lead. ss but all in all do not agree with the polacy of all students need to have a after school club it wll be to much work and students have things to do they need a break sand they also ave homework for all of therw classes so I think they shouldnt have to do afterschool activitiesÂ
