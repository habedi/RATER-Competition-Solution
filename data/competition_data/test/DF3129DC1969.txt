Phones and driving

I believe that despite the good that comes out of phones, they also have some serious cons when it comes to driving. 11 teens each day die due to using their phone. Not only are you risking your own life while operating a vehicle while texting, you're also putting other people's lives in danger. Using your phone while driving is a distraction no matter what the situation is. You also never know if the person in front of you could suddenly stop so having your phone out could lead to an unnecessary crash. There are a few reasons why cell phones shouldnt be used while driving. There are just so many dangerous things that could happen that are associated with the use of a cell phone and driving.

Driving decreases the amount of attention you have on the road which increases the amount of crashes. If you are driving 60m/h your car is moving 16 meters per second, so just a few seconds that you dedicate looking at your phone could result in a serious crash. Just reaching for an object like your phone is just as dangerous. The act of a conversation is also still a distraction. The act of a conversation creates a depth of though which takes away from the attention you should have on the road.

Luckily today we have things like apple carplay which you can use for urgent situations which reduces the amount of accidents. Over all, phones should not be used while operating a vehicle and if the situation is so urgent then it's safer to just pull over and take care of the situation. Doing that will reduce the amount of crashes each year. If we learn to prioritize the amount of things done while in a vehicle then it will save so many lives. We all need to understand the real dangers we put ourselves through along with other people while using our phones or any sort of technology while operating a vehicle. Technology has a lot of pros but many cons when it comes to driving with another distraction.
