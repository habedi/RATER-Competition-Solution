Dear principal,

If you are planning to make them work , make them work in groups of at least five or ore students. For example, if one student has a job of carrying heavy boxes it would take to long for one person to complete it. Instead of having them work by themselves let them have fun and enjoy the time with their friends while they work.

You should have some students be able to choose if they would like to attend community service. For example, if students become ill they can infect other people to become ill as well. Some students might have plans on the day the have to attend community service. Canceling you plans with your friends or family will be a hassle.

If some students wish to attend community service, give them a reward for doing so. For example, have a party, or take them to a buffet for their job well done. Or, if they wouldn't want to do those things take them to an amusement park.

You should let students decide whether they would like to attend community service for their friends or just the reward of have a good time. If you would like to do something else besides community service, ask the students if they want to or not.
