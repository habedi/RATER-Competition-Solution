No one likes summer projects, it just interferes with the whole point of summer which is to have fun and forget about school. But imagine having to come up with your own project, than having to complete the project that you already made by the end of the summer, doesnt that sound like so much work. Summer Projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to grade for the teachers, you would be able to work with your peers in your class, and it would be less work to complete for students.

If everyone were to come up with their own project it would be difficult on the teachers end because they would have to grade everyones project. Each kid would have a completely different project from each other, which would cause confusion and take up too much of the teachers time. In Generic_School one year they actually tried to experiment if kids would be more productive if they were to make their own project and it turns out that students were emailing my teacher like seven times a day asking questions about each of their projects just for them to fail that exact project. That is when they realized that the student-designed project was not the smartest thing to come up with.

With everyone having pretty much the same summer project it would give students the chance to work in groups with their peers. Working in groups could help build social skills, it could better your leadership skills, and it could make you more open minded on certain topics and ideas. Working in groups could also increase your chances of getting a good grade because you would of other students working on it aswell and profreading it which would increase the chances of your project getting a good grade. I noticed everytime I would work in groups for certain assignments that my chancing of getting a passing grade was higher because I had other people helping me with the assignment and making sure it was done to the best of my ability.

Summer is all about having fun and enjoying your summer without interuptions. Summer projects defeat the whole purpose of having a summer break because you still are requiered to finish up assignments while trying to have fun on vacation, So having the least amount of work would be beneficial to the students and teacher because they coud spend more time enjoying their summer instead of focusing on work. It woud be easier for the student to complete and easier for the teacher to grade through. If a students feels as if an assignment is too much for them to complete some might get lazy to the point where they will not even want to complete the assignment because their is no point in doin an assignment the will not complete.

However having students design their own projects would be a great idea because it would force them to think creatively, and wisely. It would make students have to think outside the box in order for them to earn the grade they deserve, it would make them strive for the grade they want. Students work hard for the things that they believe in, and spend time doing so why not have them assign their own projects and complete them, it also would be easier for them to complete since they made the project themselves.

As you can see having teacher-designed summer projects would have students working more productively, would keep teachers from doing too much when it comes to grading and it would be less work to complete on the students. So next time you see your teacher make sure to appreciate them for not over loading you with work over the summer and minimizing the asingments to the best of their abilites.
