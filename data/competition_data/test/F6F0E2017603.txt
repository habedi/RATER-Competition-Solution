Dear Principal

I think that making us do community service is not right because some of us have other thing to do in there life i mean who would want to clean up on a Saturday that would not be fair some kids do even like helping out any way. but maybe I'm wrong some people maybe help out be all I'm saying is don't make us do it because may some of us already have some thing to do like go to work for college money or study for a big test for math all. I know we do have to give back to kids help kids in need it mite be a good ideas but thing about the kids how have to watch there lil brother or sister or got a big game coming up a head for football or some thing just lets us sign up and don't make us do it. I don't know its all up to you but just thing about the kids how go to the high school will you.\ that all

Your Trustily, student
