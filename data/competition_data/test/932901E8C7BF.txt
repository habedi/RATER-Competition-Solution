Space is always going to be a mystery to us. We will never be able to explore all of our universe. However, we can stil hold hope that maybe there are other life forms out in space. So when "The Face" was found on Mars in the region Cydonia, many people were shocked, especially the public! Many people think that "The Face" is real, although the images resemble landforms here on Earth, the images show it is a landform, and scientists have checked the image and conclude that it is just another landform. This is why the face on Mars is just a natural landform.

Have you ever found a small object around your house and wondered; What is this thing? So you compare it to other household objects and find that it resembles something you have. This is exactly what scientists have done with "The Face". They weren't sure what it was exactly, but after careful evaluation, they found it looks just like a butte or a mesa- landforms that are found in the American West. This is why "The Face" is just a landform, because it is exactly like a bunch of landforms found lots of places. In the text it says, "'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'" This statement shows how the Face is a replica of landforms on Earth, and how it is nothing more than that. These reasons show how the Face is nothing more than a ordinary, dull landform found on Mars.

Imagine this. You are about to look through a microscope to observe a piece of grass. Now without the microscope, you see an ordinary, green weed. However, when you take a look at the grass with a microscope, you can see all of the cells, and pigments, and structures that make the grass appear the way it does. Scientists have taken these exact steps in order to classify the Face for what it is, which is a landform. The images show the face is just a natural landform. Without a careful evaluation, the image looks like a real face. Likewise, when scientists went and examined the Face with a careful observation, they found that the shadows, and angles, and structures of the landform all made it appear as a face. In the passage it states, "The caption noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'" This piece from the article stands to show that images prove the Face is a landform. Agree or disagree with me, the proof is in the pudding.

I know many people who want to point out others flaws, yet are blind to their own. I know any people who strut around boasting how wise, glorious, and flat-out amazing they are, but have nothing to show for all of their talk. I am sure you know atleast one person like this: we all do. However, when a rocket scientist tells you a picture of a Face is a landform, and has proof to back it up, chances are you will agree with them because you know they are wise and capable of finding the right answer. This is why the Face is just a landform, not only can scientists walk the walk, but they can talk the talk! They have evidence that shows the Face is a landform, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument afterall." Stements like this can be believed becasue they are coming from intelligent people who know what they are talking about.

Whereas I know that the Face is just a landform, many people think "the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists." While I can agree that a huge discovery like this might want to be kept a secret for a while in order to figure out what the next step would be, why would you not trust somebody who has an enormous amount of intelligence? Are you a rocket scientist? No. So why doubt one when they tell you that they have examined the Face and found it is nothing more than a landform?

The Face on Mars is a natural landform. Scientists have compareed it to other landforms on Earth, checked the images which show it is a landform, and scientists all agree that it is, in fact, a natural landform. Many people want to keep their hope alive by suggesting NASA wants to keep the actual evidence a secret, but at the end of the day, who know more? You or a Rocket Scientist? I think we both know the answer. Now, we might find aliens in the future, but for now we are yet to have any company in Space.
