Why should summer be about learning if that is the purpose of school? Students go to school for most of the year and than they get a break, but are forced to do a project on a matter they may or may not like. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will have a lack of motivation if it's on a subject they don't like, they can pick their own project ideas with in reason of the school,and students can be learn to think independently from there teachers and make their own decisions

Students will lack the motivation to do a project if it's not on a subjects like because they believe that the subject as no value or purpose for them. For example,a student gets a list of project ideas they must choose from,but they don't like any of the ideas on the list; they still have pick a subject even though they don't find any value. The student will ignore the project because they think the idea is as no value or purpose to what they want to do in life. The subject on which the project is on was on value or purpose to the student because it was nothing to do on what they value or purpose in their education. Another example is,a student does a project on what a teacher thinks is a valuable lesson that they should learn about, but the student thinks the opposite but is told to find reasons on why the lesson is valuable. If a student was to pick their own subject on the project they would have more motivation because it has more value and purpose than on something that their teacher thinks is valuable and purposeful to them. Students would find better motivation to do the project now that they can do it now what they if valuable and purposeful. This shows that students will lack motivation to do a project if it was teacher-designed because the subjects that teacher pick have no value or purpose to a students education,and that students-designed will give a student more motivation to do something that they find valuable and purposeful than on a subject that can't express themselves on.

Students can pick their own project ideas instead of the teachers ideas because students may have some better ideas than the teachers do. For example, a student wants to do a project on the important's of sleep in teens, but that isn't in the teachers list of ideas; it limits the students imagination and creativity; the teacher could have lost out on the opportunity to read or hear about a good subject. This limits the students imagination and creativity by limiting them to project ideas that have been over and over again and their creativity with old subjects and putting it into more modern or in a different way of approaching that same idea. If the students were to stick with the same project ideas and never use their imagination and creativity and would never learn different ways to approach on a topic that many people have seen, but never in a different way. This shows that students picking their own project ideas is a way to use their imagination and creativity and approach new or same ideas just differently is better than a teacher-design because teacher can get better topics from their students and use them for new students to come and not use the same ideas over and over again. The student and the teacher are two different groups,so what the teacher thinks is a good project idea is not the same for a student because they think differently.

If summer projects were teacher-designed than it doesn't allow the student to think of these ideas them themselves. The students are relying on the teachers to pick the ideas, so they will never have to think for themselves, but if the the projects were student-designed that would allow the students to think for themselves and make their own decisions. For example, teachers allow the students to chose ideas and teach them to be independent from them and suffer the conquensens if they don't chose a subject. The students learn the independence from teachers because they won't always have a teacher to depend on when they are out of school. This shows that being independent from the teacher is important because it teaches students to rely on themselves later in life.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students will have a lack of motivation if it's on a subject they don't like, they can pick their own project ideas with in reason of the school,and students can be learn to think independently from there teachers and make their own decisions. Students learn to use and expand their imagination and creativity if they can think for themselves and it also teaches them to be independent from teachers because the won't always have them in the future.
