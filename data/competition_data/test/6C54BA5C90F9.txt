wonts to do policy 1 because the students must have there phone incase of emergency but students .Must have there phones cut off unless they really have to use it they can mess with it doing lunch hour but that's it because phones will throw off the students focus from learning the student can be texting. Are calling someone but they don't need that because they need to learn about what's going on because in the long run it will catch them and mest them up in life all because of a cell phone that's why it is important to cut your cell phones off on class but they still will have time. To play with there phones later but education comes first before a phone a phone will not help u get into college are make it in to any kind of high pay jobs for example like a doctor are a police firefighter are a lawyer. Are u can own your own place like car place and that. Is your phone must be turned off and put please don't have your phone out and that is why we are going with policy 1 which allows students to bring phones to school and use them doing lunch hour as long as there cut off doing class periods.
