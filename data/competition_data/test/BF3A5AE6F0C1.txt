Summer break, the most favored break out of them all, mainly because, it is the most extensive break of the school year, and there are a lot of activities to do, and places to see over the long summer break which everyone enjoys. Summer break is also a good way to forget about all the stressful things that happened during the school year, like having a lot of homework, and not being able to complete it on time, and other things. Over summer though, there is no homework, so nobody has to worry or stress about having to do it. However, some schools actually do give out homework over summer in the form of projects, and the reason for this is so students can continue learning even over their summer break, but should these projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Well, most projects during the school year are teacher designed already, but over summer they should probably be student-designed projects and the reason why is because, students can actually do something they are interested in for the project and not something that they most likely do not want to do.

First of all, summer projects are a good way of ensuring that the students do learn something, but a student-designed project would ensure that the student would learn something that they would actually be interested in, too many times in school students are pushed to do something, and learn something, that they dont have any interest in. If the projects were student-designed, students might even want to do them over the summer. For example, if a student had to do a summer project that was a student-designed project for history class, and this student was heavily passionate about taking photos, they could do a picture collage of all the historical sites they visited over the summer, the student does what they are passionate about like taking photos, and the teacher gets his historical project or a project of any subject for that matter. Student-designed projects offer more choices on how to do the project than teacher-designed projects, they also offer more freedom and this is good because then the students will enjoy the project and get a good grade out of it rather than doing something they consider as "boring" or "not fun", and most importantly they will learn things during their break which is the whole purpose of summer projects whether they are student-designed or teacher-designed.

Secondly, Though some may argue that with teacher-designedÂ projects, students will learn more and will actually do their project, it can also be argued that the students will learn either way, with any method, in fact students might even retain the things they learned better with the student-designed projects, than with the teacher designed-projects because they did something they were actually interested in. Also, since they are doing something that they want and not something that they need to do for the project, the student-designed projects are more likely to have students successfully complete them rather than the teacher-designed projects, though in both cases they might have the same amount of students who actually complete them, since the students know that it is for a grade. Another benefit of the student-designed option, is that they are less stressful since the students get a say in their projects, and they will have more options to chose from with what they want to do for that specific project. Student-designed projects are beneficial to both the student, and the teacher, and while the same can be said about teacher-desgined projects, the students would memorize and maybe even learn more things with student-designed projects, and it could also be a more fun and less stressful way of doing a project and learning.

In conclusion, I stand by my opinion that students that have projects over summer break, should have student-designed projects rather than teacher-desgined projects because, the students can learn something they want to learn, in contrast to learning things that they arent interested in, and though most of that information is vital and nessecary to the student's future lives, there are better ways to ensure they learn those nessecary skills, and student-designed projects are one of those ways. I believe that those student-designed projects will lead to students achiving a better grade in class, learning the vital school information, and learn something that they desire to learn.
