Dear , Principal

Some student like doing community services for there community and some students think its a waste of time i' m going to try to persuade you to encourage all students to at least 100 community hours .

Student should be encouraged to take community hours because instead of them going home and just start watching t. v or play video games like 95% of the students do when they home and do that for the rest of day they can be out helping the community they can go to a school and tutor kids or go help clean up the local park or at least help with something.

Another reason why students should be encouraged to participate in community services because instead of the 10% out students out there are doing drugs and ruining the community they can be helping it by help clean up the litter they find in the street and to help stop polluting the water sources they have and try to get a petition to get a car pool lane on the highway to help stop air pollution.

My 3rd & final reason that student should be encourage to do community service hours because they may think that because you help the community you might get a reward of money or something that wont matter because the most best important reward that you know you helped your community become a better place to learn , keep safe and live.

In conclusion these where my main reasons why all students in school should be encouraged to do community services.
