Some students despise being in class all day long and are always complaining about coming to school. As technology is getting better everyday, an opportunity has come where students can be taught at the comfort of their own home. Teaching online has become a new way for students to stay focused and on track while staying at home. Either through video call or online course learning, it is a easy way for teachers to get the information we need to us, and students to able to comprehend the information easily. Distance learning is a new and easy way for students to learn because they will be able to be in a comfortable learning environment; furthermore, the students would also always be on time and ready to work because of how advanced technology has become.

Students will be able to be in a comfortable working environment; as a result, they will be focused and on track with all of their work. School can be very fast paced and hectic getting to all the classes on time and ready to learn. The hallways are crowded and loud, and the very next minute you could be taking a very important test. Some students believe that it is very difficult to be running around the school and trying to focus in class. Being at home in a quiet place before taking an important test, or just learning information, is far better than being in a crowded area and trying to focus on your work.

With technology becoming more advanced, getting to these classes would be very fast and students will always have access to it. Students would also be on time to these classes because they won't have to leave their own home. Teachers would also find it very beneficial because it is a lot of one on one time with the student. Teachers and students would always be working together and the students will have the best opportunity to learn without any interruptions. Aside from technology, another reason why online school would be beneficial is that students skip meals during the day at school because they may not have time or may not want to pack a lunch. With online courses, students can eat healthy meals and exercise in their free time which will lead to a healthy lifestyle for the students.

Although there are many benefits to online classes, many people are skeptical about this. People believe that students will get distracted in their own home by video games, YouTube, or the internet. This may be true because many high school students get distracted easily but this could be where parental ad vision comes to help. Parents could set boundaries on when to use video games and the internet. This would help the students by not being tempted to distractions and the students would focus on school. Another reason why people appose distance learning is that students won't get the face to face talking ability with teachers. This could be solved by video chat and one on one help by the programs that can be run with the new technology.

Online courses is a new way for students to learn and stay focused. Students will be in a better learning environment and they will be on time and ready to learn everyday with new technology. Students aren't the only ones benefiting, teachers will also have time to help the students one on one which will be the best opportunity to learn. Online courses should become a learning tool because the benefits are too great to pass up on.
