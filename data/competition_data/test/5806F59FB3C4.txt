We live in an age of technology where one could not go a single minute without being influenced or even witnessing tech. Going off of that, technology is used more and more in the educational system, with classes using computers and i-pads for everyday acivities. The Facial Action Coding System would be a perfect addition to the educational sytem and could even make a huge impact on average people's everyday lives.

Technology in schools is a wonderful tool, offering millions if not billions of different sources and programs online with the click of a button. When used properly, students can grandly enhance their learning skills with the use of technology. However not every program, resource, or tool works for every single student, which is where the Facial Action Coding System would come in. Using this device, teachers can potentially get feedback on whether student's are enjoying what they are doing, what one could do to make a student's learning experience better, and with this device a teacher could even tell if their class is confused or bored. Since emotional expression are so important in a classroom, a teacher could potentially even modify the lesson plan based off of the overall moof of the class.

This invention is groundbreaking on it's own, and bringing it into the educational system with it's proper use and encorporation, could be of tremendous help to the United States educational system.
