You tell that student in school maybe want to use there phone for lunch period and free time. Maybe some school do not have that policy, that student may not have phones at school at all. To convincing you the principal I believe that policy 1 is great. Why because in some school do not allowing student to use they phone for lunch and free period. I believe my opposite that student may need phone all time and learn that, you can bring phone to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. Why you show them that not all school allow student to have phone.

I do support the policy 1, but with you the principal do not agree in this policy you may want to get policy 2. That said, do not allow student to have phones at school at all, because the way they act or that they to much texting and talking, with like. I feel the choice is policy number 1 because, I want all student to be free for a while and have fun with there phone. They may want to playing games in there phone and chart for a period of time, in lunch or free time.

Therefore i feel for a remain you that some school do not allow phone, but if you want pick that student may use phone for lunch and free times but in class there no phone at all. I really agree on policy 1, i really like it a lot and I also may want to reconsidering policy 1. Thank you for listening to response and may you choice the right one, in your conniving
