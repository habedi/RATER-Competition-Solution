Using dirverless cars can be very dangrous in the world and I do not think they would be a very good idea to have around, they could have things wrong with them in many differnet ways, cars need someone to control them. They are for transportation, they are made for someone to drive them and making them driverless is not the best thing to do.

Driverless cars could always have its bad things so say youre driving on the street and there are people walking on the sidewalk, maybe the car just starts to swerve and drives into the people. Would that be the peoples fault that are in the car or the people who made the cars fault, who knows because its really not the people fault that are in the car, but its not really the makers fault either.

The driverles car could always just have a malfunction, maybe say you are on the highway going about 60 and all of the sudden youre accelerating and end up going 90 then when to comes to stop it doesnt. It crashes and makes a big wreck well the people in the car are now hurt and we just want people safe, in the article it says "most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe" the best way to do this is to make sure we do not end up with driverless cars.

Drverless cars wouldnt be so bad maybe if it was only like the parking and backing up, maybe it could come in help with the people who are not very good a parking and things, but they should not be totally driverless. Lets say you get pulled over because of the car going to fast, now would that be the people in the cars fault and would that be a liability for them or the makers of the car. Well does the car just know when its going to fast or to slow and how.

I do not think that driverless cars would be a good idea, it can cause people to get hurt and cause many things to go wrong. To many liability issues that would be put apon the person in the car, even though they would have nothing to do with what the car is even doing how fast its going and where its going.
