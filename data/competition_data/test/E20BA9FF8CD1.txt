Dear Principal;

I understand that you want students to have good grades. I think that if you cut them off from activities that take up time, they will have more time to study and less time to worry. Instead of worrying about the play production or 'the next big game' they would start worrying about the test next week or a project due in two days. Eliminating resources is a good idea and will get students' grades up to at least a grade B average.

If you limit student's time on studying, they may not do as well as they should. When you give them more time to think about school and less about other things that are happening, they will give more thought on their school work. When you eliminate people's options, they make the best out of what's happening so they fill their time with work, therefore getting their homework done. I understand your concern for student's grades and that if their grade is not acceptable, they will not get good jobs and get into good colleges.

A student's grade can affect what they do in the future. If they get very good grades, like A' s, then they will become very successful. If they get bad or unacceptable grades, like C' s and D' s, they might have a negative attitude for certain things, thinking that they won't be able to do it or that they might just fail so not even try. I think that if students get their grade up to a B, they will become optimistic about things, knowing they can do it and that they will move on and do productive things. If they get good grades in middle school, that leads on to high school, college, and determination for their future.

I know that these students may not be trying their best or their hardest, but if you cut them off from what they love, they may understand that bad graders equals no sports or something they enjoy. When they get grades that are acceptable, they may be able to join the soccer team again or get back in the play. I know that if you give them time, they will improve and they will make a good plan for their future. Thank you for your concern.
