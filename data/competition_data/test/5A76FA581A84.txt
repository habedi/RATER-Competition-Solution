Have you ever wondered how it would be like to travel the world? Then become a Seagoing Cowboy its invigerating to do. You travel by boat to distant lands and drop animals to those places. My crew would play games on return trips in the empty space on boats. We would play games like vollyball, baseball, table tennis Tournaments, and all sorts there. These are just some of my reasons to join now!

I also got to see alot of things on th trips I went on, nine to be exact. On a trip to China I got to see the great and Marvelous Panama canal! Venice a beatifull city with steets of water was one of my stops. These are sights some only wish on going and wouldn't imagine anyone passing that up! Thats why I'm here, to tell you to join now it changed my mind and it will change yours to. I wish you could see what I saw on my trips, its better than any picture you will ever see of it.

In my conclusion I would like to say it's not without its risks. I almost fell off the ship once but some metal caught me and I wassafe. You also attend the animals on board the ship and clean the Stalls or else it would stink bad. Other than that you have that feeling in you that you made a right choice. You would to if you joined us ,and become a Seagoing Cowboy today. You will never regret joining trust me from experience.
