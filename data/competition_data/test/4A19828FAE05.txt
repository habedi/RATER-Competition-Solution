The popular saying goes, "If you don't use it, you lose it." This phrase commonly refers to knowledge retained in the brain, and how if left out of practice, the human mind could let go of key information like mathematic equations, scientific formulas, and when and where to use a semicolon. Fortunately, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projects should not be teacher-designed, but student-designed because student-designed projects encourage creativity, students will be more likely to do projects that they designed, and while some will say that teacher-designed projects would more accurately reflect what will be in store for those students when they return, a rubric for the project would cover everything nicely.

Creativity is arguably the most important cognitive skill a student could learn. After I had returned from my summer break, I had difficulty thinking of creative solutions to problems. I couldn't picture and create something I was truly proud of, and it took an extended period of time for my creativity to be reignited. While some students have summer jobs, a school-assigned, student-designed project over the summer would keep them confident about their education and creative for their classes. Projects designed and developed by students would keep their creative juices flowing over the summer, keeping students' minds awake and prepared for the return of school in the fall.

Students are more likely going to do projects they design because it is their own goal, not one set by another person. Over several summer breaks, students are assigned summer reading lists that are rarely completed by them. This is because, out of disinterest, students do not want to do it. You are the one that sets your New Year's resolutions, not other people, because you know how you can improve. The same reasoning could be used in this scenario. Students, when it's their idea and design, will be more likely to put more time and effort into a project more than a teacher-designed one.

Teacher-designed projects would offer the same amount of preparation for the next school year as a student-designed project with a comprehensible rubric. With a rubric, students can still be inspired by learning more about topics that will be learned when they return. Wide guidelines that still keep students on track, students will thrive creatively over the summer.

Summer projects should not be teacher-designed, but student-designed because student-designed projects encourage creativity and students will be more likely to do projects that they designed. Inspiring students with projects they design would be ideal for the next school year.
