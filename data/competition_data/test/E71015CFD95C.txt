Dear principle,

I like the idea of community service. It could benefit us in many ways such as getting into better high schools and job reference. Though i don't think it should be a requirement because people have many things to do like sports and daily tasks. It also depends on how many hours you must do because that could also affect my decision. It would be nice to have everyone do community hours if it was possible but sometimes you just cannot. Such as getting a ride there or where to go. Those are the few problems that come along.

I think it should be mandatory at a short amount of time because then people would try to do it and not really affect their lives much. It is possible to do this but some will not because they think it doesn't really matter. There should also be consequences if you don't do them otherwise people won't do them. Like if you didn't do your hours you could not participate in a event or they would not be able to go to the next grade level.

We should increase the hours of community service every year. At first we should have two hours then three and we build off of that. We could also do it by grade level such as 6th grade three hours, 7th grade 5 hours, and 8th grade 8 hours. That is a reasonable way to do this because this way they get accustomed to the new rule.
