Phones and Driving

Cellphones are a big part of the modern world today. Everywhere you look there are people using their cellphone, but one place no one should never be using their phone in their vehicle. Driving while using a cellphone is very dangerous. If someone has received a text while driving they should ignore it until they get to their destination, or a accident could occur.

When someone is driving their phone should either be in their console or in the driver side door, and it should be on silent. There should only be one exception to use a phone while driving, and that is if someone needs to use their GPS. Then it should be in a secure place where they can hear the directions and know where to go.

Texting while driving can be very dangerous, it can cause accidents and they may be fatal. No text call should be so important that it cost someone their life. Phones are very good to have just not in the car.
