dear Principal from: Student

I am going to tell you the negative and positive of the negative changing the policy to from C average to B.

Mostly some students get between C and B or lower. Some A' s students don't really play sports they do other extracurricular activities such as play instrument and etc.

half of B' s students half of them do sports. For some students that are good at sports but get C or lower won't we able so they are going to play outside of school and our school is not going to win trophy' s or be known good at sports. So some students might move to another school and other new students that are good but not their grades aren't going to come to this school.

The good thing about changing the policy is the students who get a C or lower are going to be working hard to play in a sport. It is good for the school because the will play the sport and the school will known as a smart school. New students will transfer here and students will be successful for the future.
