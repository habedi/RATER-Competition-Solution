In the text is states,As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! Second of all, ladforms aren't hard to miss. For example, in the text they explain that it was hard to take a picture because of cloud coverage. Just becasue the clouds coverd it doesn't mean that the clouds will clear, and i'm sure you could have seen it just not all of it. Lastly, When the picture was taken they said that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of the 43 meters per pixel in the picture taken in 1976. Just becasue the meters per pixel is smaller doesn't indicatethat the landform is small. Seeing it on picture is way different then seeing it up close.
