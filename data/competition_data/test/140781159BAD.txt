I think it is a good idea for all of the 8th graders to take a community service for once in a while. it can help us to do better in life, no just for us but for other people. we can pick out of all different kinds of community services. we can try littering its a helpful decision not just for use but for others. It can prevent others from getting all kinds of sickness, and all so it can be a better place for every human on earth.

We can prove to other people that community service doesn't take a lot of time. They can try something short of time but they can still help out some way. There is a lot of other kinds of community services that don't take a lot of time but still they can be fun. One of them can be planting trees, flowers, anything you would like to plant and it can take about 10 to 20 minutes and you still can have lots fun doing it. Once you start you'll be liking it and be wanting to join other activities. Its fun you can just find something you like and you'll enjoy doing it.

You can try asking them to see what they like to do or what they do best , once you know what they like to do you can find different community services they can enjoy and at the same time having fun doing it. If people think they don't have time or that it takes a lot of there time, you can try showing them short but fun activities that they can enjoy. Instead of them being stuck at home watching TV the can try and go do some other activities that they know they will like and enjoy doing them.

If there good doing sports, they can teach young ones how to play. these can be some of the community services that they can try out and see if they like them cooking , planting, like animals, help old people ,like to cure animals that have been hurt, helping old people getting there groceries, there is a variety of stuff they can try and then see if they like it. if they like any one these or different one they can try doing it once in a while and they can get use to doing it and they can have fun doing them. And it can help us do a better life for little ones when they get big they wont have the variety of sickness that we have. It can be a better world for us and for all. we can try cleaning up litter it can prevent all this damage we are doing to are world and buy helping with no littering it can be the best for us and for all.

we can try spreading the word with others not just about not littering but about communty services they can have fun doing it and they can enjoy it.
