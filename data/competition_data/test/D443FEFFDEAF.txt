Imagine having a dark cloud always forming over you even in happy situations. For most students, this cloud is formed over the whole summer break. This is because teacher are now creating projects for students to complete over this time and ruins the students relaxation and fun. Though on paper is makes sense to give students work so they won't forget, not letting the student have a say in how may even ruin their summer break experience. But, letting a student design their own project is a great idea because it can be personalized, the student will remember, and the project will be very effective.

PersonalizingÂ has now become one of the most popular characteristics in modern culture. There are now personalized cars, shoes, clothing, and many more. With this new characteristic coming into play, is it possible for schoolwork to be personalized as well? The answer is yes because if the student designs their own project then they would be able to pick the type of project right for them. An example of this would be that one student loves to read books, so they decide to create a project based around books they read over the summer. A project would be different for another student who loves to play outside and is not a fan of reading, this student would be more enthusiastic about creating a project based around the different wildlife they have seen over the summer. With student customization in a school project, students would want to engage in their project fully over the summer because they designed a project that fits their own interests and be unique.

One problem that goes into summer projects is that most students will forget about it until the last few weeks of break. But if a student were to design their own project to do over the summer than the project would be harder for them to forget about. This is because if a student were to spend a few weeks thinking about possible ideas and designing the project. The project would be stuck in their mind like glue. It is proven by psychologists that if you think about something or do something over and over again it will be harder to forget and this would be the same if it were a project. Since that student were to think about that project while designing it for a long time, when summer hits the idea of finishing that project would never leave the students mind. Having the student design their own project is beneficial because the student would be able to remember the project over break.

One argument that people do bring up with student-designed projects is that the student will create a project that is going to be easy to finish. While is this a good point, however, this problem would be easily fixed by the teacher having to approve of each student's project idea. If that teacher were to think that the project is easy than all she would have to do is tell that student what the project would need more of. This technique is different than the teacher-designed projects because although the teacher may ask for greater rigor in a project before approval, that project is still solely designed by the student and the student would decide how to make a project rigorous for her approval. This approval technique is very effective because it not only allows for the student to create their own project, but the teacher is also able to make sure that the student creates a project that is effective.

With these ideas in mind, the idea of having the student design their own summer project sound incredible. Every project would be personalized to the students interests and style, the student would not forget about the project, and the little teacher involvement would still create an effective project. Over summer break every student is given the choice to do whatever they want instead of school and this should also be applied with work. With a student-designed project, expect exquisite work that shows off a students personality, well thought out work, and effective learning from each student.
