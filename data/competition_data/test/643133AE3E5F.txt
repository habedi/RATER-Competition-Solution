Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think we should have to do community service through out the year starting in the 6th grade. It can help you with a better chance to give back to the community that has given to you in the past. It can also teach us to be more generous to the people around you.

So If I may say, this can be a great way for students to be nice, and show there Christianity to other people. Over all cause we come form Christian family's, and from a private Christian school, that has taught us to be nice and generous to the people around us.

For the younger kids, some don't understand what it means to give back to the people around you and be generous. Such as going along the highway and picking up garbage, or going to some elderly persons house and offering to rake the leaves or take the weeds out of there garden. It can be hard for them, but they can still do little things of community service. Such as going to a nursing home and singing to the elderly, or even just talking with them. They can make cards for people that they know that are in the hospital right now are in the hospital right now or are going through a hard time. They might just make their day. So i hope you take this to consideration and think about these things have been addressed to you, and make the school even more happier with you decision. Thank you.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
