Dear, STUDENT_NAME

well, i think all students should be able to perform community service. Because people as individuals should care about their community. Kids are a big part in community service; they can tell their friends in their neighborhood to join there community service and to stop littering. in my opinion everybody of all ages should be apart of their community services around town.

First, students in our school can start helping the community by beginning a school wide service to clean up their community. So you should tell your kids to ''go outside and find a community service to join to help our environment and community a better place to be''. If you are a kid you should go and convince your friends to join a community service and start recycling.

Secondly, America as an individual should stop littering. Littering has cause air pollution and that's why you need to stop litter now.

Also air pollution has gotten many people sick. So just start now when you get done with a snack and your outside find a dumpster or run home and throw your trash away. Because your trash on the ground can cause pollution.

However, I hope that you tell your friends to join your local community service club or just start your own with all of your friends in it. And then your friends can pass it on to their friends and so on. But when you talk to your friends makes sure you tell them the reasons why they would want to join your group.

Finally, community service is a big part of our environment and so are you. And you can start by helping the streets get clean and pick up trash from around your neighborhood or at school. But it is up to us to make a difference in our world
