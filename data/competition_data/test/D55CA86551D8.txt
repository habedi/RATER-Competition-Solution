Dear principle,

I think that it would help if every student helped out by doing some type of community service whether it be tutoring at a local elementary school, or picking up litter, or just going by a retirement center and just talking to some of the lonely elders that live there. But I do not think it is a good idea to force them to do it because when you help someone or something like your community it's supposed to be out of the goodness of your heart, not because you have too.

I think that if you do force them to do it then you should only do it once or twice to try to motivate them to help other's or so that maybe they realize that it's not that bad just to do a little bit here and there to help out other's in a nice and helping way. I think that the best way to approach this matter is to create a club or committee that does community service and helps people realize that it is important to do community service to help out your community.

Those are just a few reasons why I think that your students should not have to be forced to do community service. Although students do have a lot of time to waist, I do believe that there should be a community wide program developed to try to influence more people to get involved in community service, not just students. I believe that if you can get one community very strong in community service that it might spread like a virus to surrounding areas and make a huge difference in not only your community, but others too.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
