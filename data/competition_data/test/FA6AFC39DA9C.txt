I have been to tons of places around the world. I would want lots of people to be a Seagoing Cowboy. I got to visit Europe and China. Then we would go help others after wars. I would help by giving food supply and animals to people who needed them. You could do the same too.

However, we got to see the Acropolis in Greece. Our crew also got to go on a Gondola ride in Venice to Italy. Then we went to a castle in Crete and to Panama Conal. The crew would help animals that we would bring on the ship to send to other countries. We would spend the rest of our time playing fun games together.

When I got to help people I also got to see that part of the country. I have made nine trips. More than any of other Seagoing Cowboy. You could probably go on more trips. We had to have 335 horses and food to take to Greece. Before that, we had to report to New Orleans.

When I turned 18 I could've been drafted to military but when they learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip they didn't make me. I was already helping other people out there. We helped people by recovering their food supplies, animals, and more. So you should benefit others and join us. It would help us and other people out there.

If you enter the Seagoing Cowboys you could sight all the countries in the world. You would also get to help others that have been hurt, and raise animals to give to others. This is a great way of helping other people with out anything. You would also get to explore other parts of the world. This is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
