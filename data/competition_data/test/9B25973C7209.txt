Studies show that 96% of students that participate in extracurricular activities report a better school experience, than those that do not partake in extracurricular programs. "Those students are less stressed, and less likely to suffer from depression," says the Virginia Health Organization, "than the students that are inactive, regarding participation in after school programs." Partaking in these programs is vital to the well-being and growth of students! Students should participate in extracurricular activities because they are beneficial to mental health, focus, and one's college application.

First, extracurricular activities benefit mental health. A study, conducted by Harvard students, focused on the benefits and effects of extracurricular activity on pupils. In the study, they signed up students who felt overwhelmed, stressed, and depressed, due to school. They put them on sports teams, debate clubs, anything they had available that the student reported being interested in. Then they scheduled therapy sessions with each participant. What they saw was an increase in general happiness, and a decrease in the students' stress. Professional psychologist Jane Woods says, "Patients who are active and participate in more school activities rarely suffer from depression. Students who are active in school appear to have much more extroverted and social personalities. Being social reduces risk of feeling alone and improves mental stability." A girl, who explains that she used to be introverted and kept to herself, now says that, "After I joined the soccer team I felt free. I talked to people, and have since opened up. I do travel soccer now, and I have left my problems behind me." Students should join extracurricular activities because it is freeing and rewarding towards mental health.

Second, getting involved in extracurricular programs can improve focus. "I used to not be able to listen in class," explains high school student, Generic_Name, "but now that my friends have invited me to join the debate team, I am always aware of what's happening in the classroom!" Generic_Name' grades went from C's and D's, to A's and B's in the matter of a month simply because, he joined debate club. A study done by Yale predicted that extracurricular activity would decrease focus, but what they found was very different. In fact, all of the students they interviewed and monitored saw an increase in grades after signing up for an after school activity. Those students additionally reported better focus in the classroom just like Generic_Name. Famous psychologist Emma Roberts wrote in a study that, "Extracurricular activity improves the brains ability to focus on more than one thing at once, resulting in a better ability to focus on one thing." Brain scans conducted on students before and after a week participating in after school activities, demonstrate the differences. Before participation, the brain scans showed less activity in the frontal lobe, and instead random activity in other areas in the brain, which indicated they were less focused. After participation however, activity in the frontal lobe spiked, and random activity in other unneeded areas, had almost completely stopped. Science only proves that extracurricular activities improve a students focus.

Finally, extracurricular activity looks good on a college application. 80% of colleges around the US reported that students with extracurricular programs listed on their application form, were more likely to get accepted than those without. Professional school applicant reviewer, Scott Berry, agrees, stating, "We look for participation in after school activity. It demonstrates a well driven individual with multiple abilities." A student who wasn't accepted into her dream school says, "I had great grades, but I just hadn't participated as much as other students, and those students were accepted over me." Having more participation will increase your chances of getting into a good college because, it's what they're looking for.

However, some say that it will only give students more stress because, they'll just have more to do. This is blatantly untrue, as demonstrated by a small school in Japan, that makes every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity. "As opposed to other schools in the area," states the principal, "Our students are happier, and report having less stress." A student who was recently transferred to that small school from another school says, "In my other school there were so many of my friends that were tired all the time, and we were all stressed out. In this school our extracurricular activities provide as an escape, or a release, from that stress."

In conclusion, participation in extracurricular activities is beneficial to mental health, focus, and college applications. Students are too stressed and after school activities could provide as a release. Our students would suffer from less mental health issues such as depression if we integrated this school rule. Students would be more focused and grades would improve. In addition, students would get accepted into better colleges which can only look better for our school. This is an incredible opportunity many miss out on, but we don't have to. I hope that our school establishes that every student join an extracurricular activity.
