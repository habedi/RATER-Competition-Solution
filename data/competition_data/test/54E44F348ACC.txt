It was the year 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was searching for a suitable landing site on a region in Mars called Cydonia for a twin spacecraft, Viking 2. While doing so a strange face appeared, (yes I said face) on Mars mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab had their jaws dropped in the image being displayed in front of them, but the excitment was short lived until scientist quickly pointed out it was just another Martian mesa of which was pretty common in the area.

Then a couple days after NASA reveiled the face on Mars hoping to spark up some attention toward the Red Planet. Did they get quick results! The face was admired by many, but this started theories that aliens on Mars created the wierd sensation.

When the Viking took the picture it wasn't as clear so on April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor went to Cydonia to take a sharper picture to display towards anxious web surfers, once taken the image appeared on the web site revealing unfortunantly a natural landform. Any conspirest in the audience can solemly agree there wasn't a alien monument after all.
