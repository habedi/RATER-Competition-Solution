Dear Principal of my school,

I believe that all of the students of our school should be required to perform community service. Some of my friends clean up litter and tutor elementary school children. Some of my friends don't think it is a good idea to do this because they are too busy doing other things that take up their valuable time. If you make community service mandatory, then my friends will have something good to do in their free time and in turn help the community our school is in.

My peers think community service is a boring chore to do. It does not have to be a chore. There are plenty of different things that they can do. They can perform music for the seniors at a senior center. The seniors would like that. They can do a park clean up for our parks which people just throw their garbage in. They can also help with renovating some of these buildings that need help. They can also get service hours by helping out at our school or different schools by doing various jobs around the building like helping out another teacher. If they want, they can visit a preschool and read to the children there as well as helping out the teachers there too.

By doing this, the students of our school could do something productive with their free time instead of playing video games or watching television. They can get a group of their friends together to do the community service with them. Then, they could hang out and work at the same time. If you make this required, then the community can be more beautiful than what it already is. Thank you.

From,
