I do agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because to grow up you should try new activities or new objectives that help you move on in life.

Example 1, a pottery class, a class where you can mold clay and make what the teacher ask you to make, can help you make new friends,be more focused depending on what your doing when making, shaping, talking about it with people who might enjoy that class with you, therefore will help you grow and move on in life.

Example 2, a wrestling class, a class or sport is when two people wrestle it out and whoever taps out loses, can make you stronger faster and better at making up strategies that can influence on what you wanna do when your grown up, therefore will help you grow and move on in life.

Example 3, a recycle class, a class where you pick up trash in parks,sidewalks,your school can help you by making you feel good to do very generous things,plus your helping out the planet making you wanna do more good deeds,and lead down a good road,therefore will help you grow and move on in life.

Why students should participate is because you are taking a healthy risk and can benefit you in many ways depending on all of the activities like soccer can help with entertainment and boredom and like volleyball can help with strateging and self asteem, common theme in all of these is having to learn from them and find solutions to problems and can help you find new interest later in life, that is why i agree with the principle.
