Will you join UNRRA?Luke bomberger help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more after World War 2. You can help these countries,and get them back on there feet. It would look so much nicer and cleaner. It would be a ludicrous idea not to join,you can help so much people. Trust me you'll be as happy as a kid in a candy store if u do this

I help on my aunts Katie's farm as a boy ,and it had prepared me for hard work. On the ship you had to do a lot of things .Like:water the animals,feed the animals. They had to clean the animals stals. It might sound bad,but it's not .It might seem boring as a brick ,but I promis it isnt.

Luke had watch duty when he was coming back from talking to the captian he sliped on the ladder on his back side. That had to hurt. He had broke his ribs. He about fell over borad in the dark Alantic Ocean. He found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Some of their games they played were baseball and vollyball. They also played :tabel tennis ,fencing,boxing,and more.

On all these details about the boat,and animals I hope you have decided to join the UNRRA.You dont have to be audacious to join. I know for sure you'll be exubrant when you join. So dont be scared just go for it. So, will you join the UNRRA?
