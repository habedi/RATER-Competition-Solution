The challege of exploring Venus is not a great idea. Studying Venus is a worthy because it's closes to our planet to earth in terms of density and size. While Venus is simple see from the distant but safe vantage poin of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

Venus is not a great planet to explore. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun". This shows that Venus is not a safe planet to explore.

The scientists are been send to study Venus. The conditions on surface Venus allow scientists to float above the roiling Venusian landscape. The temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,but the air pressure would be close to that of the sea level on Earth."However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering atandard forms of photography and videography ineffective.
