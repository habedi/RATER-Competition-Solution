I Think Policy 1 Is Good I Think Less Kid Would Get In Trouble, Because I Mean Kid Love There Cell Phone They Love To Text, Kids Should Only Use There Cell Phone During Lunch And When We Have Free Time, Or Though Passing Period. I Think That The

Kid Will Be Happy Because A lot Of Kid Want to Use They Cell Phone During

School Time To, So if This Policy Is Approve By The Principal

A lot Of Kids Will Now Love To Coming To School And They Won't

Get In As Much

Trouble

Like Before They Did.

Let's See Policy 2 Is Not Fun At All Because I Mean Kids Will Get in A lot of Trouble because

They Can Try To not Get Caught With it, And The Teacher See The Phone Out They Would Have To Sent Him Or Her to The office they Get In Trouble, And There Phone Is Taken Away, I Think that Wont Be Fun At All, Lets Hope That The Principal Said Yes To This!
