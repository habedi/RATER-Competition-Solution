The tremendous advancement in technology over the last couple decades has sponsered the growth of several new features. One such widely used feature is distance learning, the act of students undergoing classes remotely via online or video conferencing. This remote learning can be very advantageous to certain students who may not have enough time to undergo a specific class at school. However, traditional, hands on schooling is still much more benefical to students than distance learning, both in terms of academic advancement and developmental advancement.

Certain classes require hands on interactions to truly enable children to learn course material properly, and distance learning simply cannot provide these interactions. For example, a traditional science syllabus is wrought with expiraments, and by partipicating in these activites, students can witness what they are learning in the real world. As a result, students are able to better retain the information they were taught. For example, a standard biology class might involve learning about bacteria and bacterial growth. A student taking this course online will still recieve the information being taught in a traditional biology class, perhaps through a video lecture or an online reading. However, the students learning at school may be able to supplement the information that they have learned with a lab expirament that involves measuring the growth and properties of certain bacterial species. Thus, although both traditional learning and distance learning may provide the same overall course material, traditional learning offers more chances for students to better understand the content that they are presented with. Similarly, many english classes hold socratic seminars, activities where the class partipicates in a discussion revolving around a specific text. This type of activity results in students having a better understanding of the text, as they are subjected to the differing opinions of others. A student taking English online would most likely not have the opportunity to participate in a class wide socratic seminar, and they would thus understand the text they are engaged with less than a traditionally school student. These beneficial hands on activities are not limited to science and english courses. Many different classes rely on unique forms of interaction based activities, and students learning remotely would be placed at a great disadvantage by not being able to partpicate in these events.

Along with limiting the academic potential of students, distance learning also hinders the developmental growth of students. Tradtional schooling is a time in a person's life where they learn to interact with others and how to handle differing opinions. For example, partner projects present students with an opportunity to react to criticism and feedback. These learning experiences are things that students can use to succeed throughout their life. A student learning online would not be subjected to the same activities, and would thus be worse off than his or her fellow traditional students.

Distance learning is a new development that can be very beneficial when used in specific situations. For example, I needed to take physical education online two years because of certain course requirments and distance learning enabled me to complete these requirements. However, distance learning should not be something that is seen as a substitute to traditional, hands on learning. Although I was presented with the same information in my online class that other students who were taking physical education at school were subjected to, I am certain that their class enabled them to retain the information better. My online course syllabus did not include group oriented activities that I know that as a result, I could not learn the information to the best of my ability.Â
