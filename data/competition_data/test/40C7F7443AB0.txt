How would you like a free trip to Europe? Well, you can; for free. All you have to do is sign up and you'll be able to go on a free trip on a cattle boat! Some benefits of this journey consist of seeing amazing places and landmarks, spending time with your friends, and most importantly, helping others who are in need.

On your way to the amazing country of Europe, you will be able to see some of the greatest places in the world. You might see the Acropolis in Greece, take a ride in the water filled streets of Venice, see the Iefle Tower, and more! At some parts of your journey, you will be able to get off of your boat, and buy a souvenier so you can cherish your memories in Europe.

In your free time, after all of the animals are shipped off, you can have some fun and memborable time with your friends on board. Some things that my friends and I liked to do in our spare time are things like table-tennis tournements, fencing, boxing, and other great games. If you aren't the active or sportslike person, you can do other worthwhile things like reading, sleeping, and whittling.

My fondest memories of my journeys were the parts where I was able to help people. It was such a great feeling to be able to help people who can't do everything all by themselves. You sometimes even get to meet great and amazing people while you are caring for the others. Some of the friends even become some of your best long time friends. The people you are helping usually are kind to you and show gratitude and gratefulness towards you. The best part of this, is that it makes God happy.

The time you spend on the cattle boat might be the best time of your life. You get to see great places, spend time with your friends, and help people in need. You will always remember your time with the people. The journey might be one of your greatest memories.
