Dear Principal,

Most of the students don't want you to change the policy of playing sports to a grade B average because there probably wont be many students in sports anymore and then we wont be able to have any sports because there is not enough kids for a football, basketball or volleyball teams and others because you have to have to have a certain amount of kids on a team to be able to play other schools.

Most students wouldn't like this idea because they wont be able to play sports because there grades are a C average or lower. If the rules got changed to a C average or higher then there wouldn't be as many students complaining about the change because most students don't get lower then a C average. I personally think we should change the rule to a B average. We should keep it the same or move the rules to a C average.

Most schools have a rule of that kids cant be failing any classes or getting into trouble like fights, detentions exc. I don't think we should change the rules at all because its hard enough for kids to keep there grades up where they are now because some kids are really struggling with them because maybe they don't get the subject that they're struggling in. Maybe in high school the principal can raise the average up to a C so kids can get better and be more independent and they can get into a good college or get a scholarship to a college that they really wanted but they couldn't afford it.

I have never heard of a school that has rules for playing sports to be at a B average I've only heard of schools having a policy of not failing any classes and not getting into trouble all the time. Most kids like to play sports and this would really bring them down because they probably wouldn't be able to play anymore because of there grades.

I hope you actually take in all this and see what it would do to other kids and show how it would effect the sports at school because there wouldn't be as many kids playing anymore. Most kids would stand up for what they believe in, and that's what I'm doing right now.

Sincerely,

The Students
