My claim will be going against this because nobody knows how a person is feeling. Anyone can put a smile on their face just to get through the day and be feeling so much or simply going through alot but only someone whom is close to that person can probably detect their emotions and by their facial expressions on how theyre feeling. So when in the passage it stated faces dont lie these muscle clues are sometimes used when spotted when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful I disagreed. How would they know that if they just met them and are simply having a conversation maybe even if the celebrity or politician is or isnt being honest the subject may have made them feel uncomfortable or upset them but to say theyre not being truthful isnt the case because you dont know them enough to say how their feeling, or if their being dishonest based on the other peoples faces you've" studied". Since everyone is different we act differently we look differently we react differently so to say something like studies have shown that if the corners of your lips arent going upward when talking to someone theyre being dishonest is obsered. This isnt meant to offend the experts in faciacl mucles just my beliefs
