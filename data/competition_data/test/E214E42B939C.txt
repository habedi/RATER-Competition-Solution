Letter to the principal,

As a student I know how difficult it is to keep your grades up and do extracurricular activities.

Students should be able to manage their time wisely.

It is their responsibility to spend enough time studying for tests and completing their homework.

However, if students weren't allowed to take part in sports because they had a C in a certain subject it might take their mind off of the work.

It could make them think more about how upset they are because they can't participate in sports.

I don't think that making students have a B grade average is very fair because some people complete all of their assignments and do what is asked of them, but they don't take tests well so therefore their grades are affected.

Students should have at least a C grade average because it is probably something more realistic to achieve for students that participate in sports.

The school policy could also be changed and maybe if children got a B grade average or above they could be rewarded instead of being punished for not achieving that goal.

Also I think that if many of the students have a C grade average the staff at the school should make sure that their students have completed their assignments.

Also, students should ask their teachers about topics they are struggling on so they have a better understanding of it.

Overall, taking sports away from students is unfair and just distracts them even more.

If students are given an award for their hard work I think they will strive more to achieve that goal.

Punishing people may get them to realize they need to manage their time more wisely, but it won't help them do better in school.

I also believe that sports is a way for people to take away the stress of school and other things.

Sports in a way are like therapy, and if you take that away it won't help them it will only hurt them.
