Dear principal

I think the idea of community service is great. It will make out neighborhood a better place. Cleaning the litter would be great since it would make the place look better and keep the it from going into the drains which could cause allot of problems in the future. Tutoring elementary children would also would be great since it could help out in the future in making good grades and be better in there test. This would probably even make other people in the community have an urge to help and soon making our neighborhood almost perfect.

You should also have the idea of planting trees since they are very important to us and also would look good on the neighborhood .Then again that's just one of my ideas i came up. Also you should ask people around the community if someone is willing to patrol the community at night to keep on a eye for thieves which would make people sleep more calmly knowing someone keeping an eye out. So i hope you think about and hopefully make all of this be possible.
