I think that is a great idea, because some people do not have time, for go to school every day, and could take differents classes by online can help a lot of people. In other hand , is a good reason for the people still studied, and is not an excuse for say that they do not have time.

The people can recive the classes after, that work. Students can have more time for learn and they can choose when they want recive the classes they can organize their time. Also, it is a good idea for help people that even finished high school , they can be more focus on the differents classes and give the best of them.

Take classes by online it is a wonderful idea, because is something that can be avaliable for all people any time and in the cold days when is to difficult go outside students always will take the classes and they does not miss anything . This also, help to the studesnts to recive classes every day .

I am, completely agree with can take that classes online or video conferencing is a big benefict for students in addiction people that maybe never studied in their lives can take this classes and learn a lot, because some people have to work all day, and do not can in to a school that is a very big tool that can help their.

A lot of people can be agree and can support this great idea. Also, students that want lo learn a languaje or need support in a class can choose the class most need it . and can take and extra time to learn because they gonna take the clases in home and do not miss time taking a bus or driving a car.

Even people that is in school sometimes have to walk and it is so difficult , because sometimes is snowing or raining, and they miss more time and mometimes miss all day of classes . every minute counts and that is another one great reason to support it , because people can have more time.

Seconds can make a big difference, in their lives people can finished their goals and get a diploma for can have a better jod and still helping their families.

In addiction some people can get more adtitude and concentration, for each class they can take it in the living room, dinning room or just sit in the sofa, in the kitchen or bed, every place, where they want and fell more confortable, and if you fell confortable you can give the best you can.

I think that some people work better and get more concentration , when they are alone, because you do not talk with other people you work in your own. people do not can take answer from another people if are taking a online class, so it is another reason that a lot , because you have to doing your work. and you have to be concentrate and pay attention.

people also can take the classes in the wekends . the sudents that are taking classes by online can have the choice if they want to take and extra class or get support . I think that all people ,deserve can have the opportunity that can still studied. all people should have the same opportunity , It is also a good idea, because all people can get that clases and be better proffesionaly, and good citizens and help the world be the change that de world need it, because some people that are so itelligent do not have opportunity to get a good aducation even assist to high school and how i said before . I think that are the people is equal ,and deserve the same opportunities, that others have.

Some people, can be so proud know that can retake school or begging . thats will be a big hope for the people that is not study but they want to. It is a lot of reasons for can say that take classes by online or video conferencing is like the best idea that someone can have .

In other words take online classes is a great tool for that everyone can have acces to study. and get the same opportunities, that everyone deserve. and also help to learn more people can use their time apropiately. and can have acces to each class that they need it everyone can and can work and after take the classes .

I am completely agree that is something that effectively , help a lot of people that need it and people that also, want to be better , be prefessionals and good citizens. and be a change in the world.
