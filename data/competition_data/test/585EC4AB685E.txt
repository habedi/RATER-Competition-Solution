" All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car..." Now and days alot of countries are limiting car usage to go into a day of free car day, which basically means that no one is allowed to drive their motor running cars for a day. IfÂ  they disobey the law they will be charge a fine. Its like a when a police officer stops you for passing a red light or for speeding on a no speeding zone. Still these countries are getting advantages over these days because there will be less smog, less traffic, and more people buying bicycles rather than a expensive car.

" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog." one of the advantages for limiting car use is there will be less smog to deal with in the air. this can harm not only us but our environment we live in, which is the air we breath. In france they decide to do a car ban day. The result of this event was that the " Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions". If someone was brave enough to drive a car than they will be fined 22-euro which is $31.

" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters, people had their cars impounded for thier reaction to the fine". Less traffic was on the streets due this ban of cars, which allowed the people with bicycles to go on the streets and ride them. In Bogota,Colombia they also did this ban but they gained more advantages over limiting car usage, only buses and taxis were permitted to drive on the streets. their goal was to promote alternative transportation. Due to this event, parks and sports centers were packed throughout the city, and pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks for the skateboards and bikes.

" What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownerships per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn said Micheal Sivak". As a result of car ban people have stop buying cars which is atrocius for car companies but at the same time there is a up side to this also and is that people will now walk or ride bicycles to get to where they need. Which also leads to people being more atlethic and less people being obese or overweight.

These countries are gaining alot because of these car ban which is good for removing these dark clouds in the air, less traffic, and people riding bicycles rather than cars. Its obviusly that some people think that this rule is selfish or not needed but its helps more than you think it does. And some people are just mad because of what they are getting charged or fine for driving in the streets even though you can't due to the law.
