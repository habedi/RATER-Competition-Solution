Have you ever considered online school? Some schools are offering an online option for students via video conference or online course. Online school has many benefits allowing students to learn disregarding the weather, allows students and staff to have more learning and free time, and students can re watch the video classes allowing the students to go at their own pace or if they do not completely understand the material.

Some argue that online school would make it harder to ask teachers questions but, teachers and students would have more free time and learning time due to not having to take the bus or any transportation. Furthermore, if you were to subtract the time it takes to get to school and back and the time it takes to walk to classes you would have more time to ask questions and have more potential learning time with the teachers. This is important because it allows students to take more time learning and ask more question and classes would be less rushed.

Another benefit of online school is the fact that students can learn disregarding the weather or if they are sick. For example if a student is sick they can still attend class from home and not miss a day of school. Another example if there is a snow day the entire county can still learn and not be held behind due to weather.

Another benefit of online classes would be that it allows students to re watch video lessons and fully understand the lessons. Some students may have trouble fully understanding the material at fast paces but, online classes would allow the student to re watch the material and can spend extra time on certain subjects that they have difficulty in. For example if a student has trouble in math because they need more time or has forgotten the material they can review the class again.

In conclusion online school and courses has many benefits and could improve learning and allow students to fully understand material and provides more time for learning and questions. Online school also allows students to learn on snow days prevents students and staff from falling behind on material. I advise students to propose the idea of online school or have a discussion with your school administrators because online school and courses holds many benefits.
