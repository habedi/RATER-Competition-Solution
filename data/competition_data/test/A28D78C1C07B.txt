The technology in the story they are talking about is a face reader. It till you how happy mad sed evey thing . The thing that gets me is why do we need something like that is not worth the money to spend .Why do you need something that would till you how you feel dont you know how you feel .

Why would you what something so every one eles could till how you feel i dont see were it would do any good any were its just a wast of time to .but on the other hand some people would just like to have one to till them how they feel that day and to see how others feel .

But as i see it i do not see a reason for or how it could help at all but thats just my openen over it but theres people out there thta would send the money on it and one thing i would like to know is how they could till how a painting is feeling .
