The face on Mars is just a natural landform. When they took the picture it first looked like a face. Many people wondered if it was an alien made landform. It ended up being just a plain old landform on the red planet.

Many people at first were freaked out or amazed of at the face on the red planet. The story and face appeared in movies, radio talk shows, the web, social media, and magazines. But after they sent out more ships to take pictures of the land form they got a better shot. The picture looked like a natural landform. In the article it says in there "...a natural landform." The scientist at NASA also figured out that it was cloudy on the red planet when they took the picture. "The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was April '98- a cloudy time of year on the red planet."Some of the cloud or mist could of been right over the landform when the picture was taken.

The Martian looks like a butte or mesa that is around the American West. "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivanlent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plains of Idaho," says Garvin."

As you can tell from the evidence provided the Face on Mars is not really a face. It is just a landform on the red planet. It was cloudy the day they took it. They got better pictures and investigated it. The picture actully is quite close to the Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plains of Idaho.
