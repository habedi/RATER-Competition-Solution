The author supports the claim very well. The author says many ways how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. For example, paragraph 5 states "NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. imagine a blimp-like veichle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet planes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a veichle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."

It also states in paragraph 5, "But the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."

It finally states in paragraph 8, "Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."
