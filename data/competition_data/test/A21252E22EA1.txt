The face on Cydonia isn't made by aliens because there is no life on Cydonia, the Jet Propulsion Lap were happy, and the face is equivalent tolandformin the American West.

Cydonia has no life living there. It became main priority to NASA in September of 1997. This Red planet became the priority because they have captured a photo of what looked like a face. Although int he passage scientist state that they thought it was just anouther Martian mesa.

Back at the controllers Jet Propulsion Lab the passage says that the face apeared on there monitors. It was a sensationto the lap and the scientist even thought it was shortly lived. Common around Cydonia they thought it was just anouther Martian mesa. After afewdays NASA unveiled the image of the face to the puplics eye.

The picture of the face on Cydonia shows that it was/is equivalent to a buttle or mesa. Jim Garvin said " It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."At one point Garvin also said the dome takes the form of an isolated mesa, almost the same height as the face. If there was aliens on the Red planet you could see them. A picture taken was able to be as clear as possble.

I see where people would think the face was made by aliens. Yes, we don't know if there really is life on Mars. Some scientist belive the face was an alien artifact. Skepticals said perhaps alien markings were hiddenby a haze. But, there will not be life on Mars until NASA says so.

There isnt life on Mars. If you have proof then show NASA if they belive it then isuppose there is life being lived on Mars.
