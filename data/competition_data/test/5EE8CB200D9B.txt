Does your principal want you to do at least one extracurricular activity? Well I'm here to tell you that it is a great idea. Many people that is in a extracurricular activity love it. Being in a extracurricular activity has many benefits to it. Some of the benefits are the new friends, the college application, and it is enjoyable.

Making new friends can be very difficult for many people. But there are other people that make new friends because of the extracurricular activities. Being in a extracurricular activity can make getting new friends much easier. You can share and bond over the experiences you might have had. Being able to have the same interests as your team can be a great conversation starter.

Some of the extracurricular activities can look great on a college application. Any sports activity can defiantly help with getting into a great college. The team building you do in the activity will look good on your permanent record. And there are colleges that now look at how you behave with other people and how good you work with them. Being in at least one extracurricular activity can prove that you can behave around other people.

Being in a extracurricular activity can be an enjoyable experience. Some people might think that being in an extracurricular activity can be a waste of time. But for other people, the new people that you meet and the activities you get to do can make their time there worth it. The fun games, the people, and the new things you learn can be a great experience. And even if you aren't good at any of the activities, there are people there that will help you through it.

I defiantly agree with the principle making students being in any extracurricular activity. Even though there are people who might disagree with the idea. I think it is a great way for the students to get out of their comfort zone and start making new friends. The activities they have can guarantee an enjoyable experience. And when they start looking a colleges in the future, they can get in thanks to great behavior they displayed.
