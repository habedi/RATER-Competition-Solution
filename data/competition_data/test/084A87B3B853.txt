Dear, principle

I feel that phones should be aloud. Because you never know there could be an emergency or some students just get bored during free time its good that they not bring them out in class but what about lunch connections. There is plenty of time during the day for some students to have out there cell phones. I get that there bad and they take away the attention from the teacher but what about the rest of the day when there is nothing to do or your at lunch even cell phones are not always bad. Some teachers use cell phones during the day why cant students? There would probably be better behavior and less talking during lunch or class because of cell phones. I also think your son has a cell phone out during the day most students do but we have to hide it and we don't want to have to. We should just be aloud to have cell phones i mean its also less stress on the teachers because they don't have to worry about it because we are aloud to have them . Without cell phones most students would be lost or anti social. They also wont use them in class only in free time but also teachers shouldn't be able to use there cell phones if the students cant during class because that is not fair to us. Just because there an adult does not mean there special at all. I also think that there would be less delinquent acts from students at school if you let them use there cell

Love Your Student,
