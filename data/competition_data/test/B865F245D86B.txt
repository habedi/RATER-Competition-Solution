Dear Principal,

I am currently an eight grade student attending your school.

Some of my friends and I are currently working community services hours and enjoy doing them.

Many other schools require an amount of service hours to graduate.

I think that community service hours should be a required thing in order to graduate.

Some of my friends agree with this, but many of them don't.

The argument is that we, as teenagers, should be required to do service hours to graduate.

Many teens do not agree with this because they say they have busy schedules and do not have enough time to work service hours and want more time to hang out with friends.

Well, I do not agree with this.

I think that service hours are very important because it teaches teens to be more responsible and helps them find out where their interest are in life and what they enjoy doing.

This will also help them pick out high school electives.

Also, it is very important that teens help around the community, because it helps them grew more responsible and mature.

Community service can put teens in positions were they have to talk to adults to find out what they have to do, if they are doing it right, and if it is being done well.

This will help teens take constructive criticism from a boss, which will prepare them for a job.

The other argument is not having enough time for friends because they play sports or involved in other activities.

Well, if they are on a sports team then they are hanging out with their friends while at practices and games.

Also, you can do service hours with your friends.

They can plan a time when they all have a free night and do service hours in order to finish them for school.

After they are done with them they can then hang out.

Services hours are can be very fun if you are doing them with your friends.

If they do them with friends then they have the chance to hang out and help out the community.

I strongly think that our school should have a required amount of service hours that they have to finish before graduating.

I believe that service hours help prepare you for the future and find where your interest are and what you enjoy doing.

You are also helping your community by having your students do service hours.

The students can do them with friends and they can have fun while doing them.

This will also help the community grew and make your students more responsible and mature.

Sincerely,
