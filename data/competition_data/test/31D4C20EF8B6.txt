Cars have upgraded so such more over the years, but as the cars increasingly upgraded they also cost more which decreases people from getting cars! 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars, 57 percent sold a car to move here. In diffrent countries cars could be lower price cars, but not just the price of cars other things too!"Passengers cas are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States". If you leave the United States and transport to Europe, things would be cheaper!

Even cars have a diffrent looks in diffrent places! In New York the suburbs looked more vauban-like in the 1950s! Some countries even get upgraded things later then other countries!

But having a car should be a good thing nomatter how it looks or how it feels its better than walking we should be happy for having the upgraded things that makes life so much easier but if you had the oppratunity to get any car you could choose wisly drive save and fallow the laws!       Â
