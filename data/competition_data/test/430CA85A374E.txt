The Seagoing Cowboys help many people after Worl War 2. Contries were left in ruins and need supplies such as food and clothing. Luke Bomberger joined after his high shool graduation. He crossed the Alantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy was the best thing that ever happened to him. That could be the same for you!

Yes,you'd be helping people and their ruined countries,but you'd be on an adventure! Luke went to Europe,Greece,China,and other exotic places. He toured castles and took fun rides on rivers or canals. He got to interact with animals to and from the places he went to. He also ofcourse got to interact with the people of these far away lands.

Now it's not just a bunch of fun and games. You have to do a lot of work. You would have many farm animals to take care of. Horses,cows,pigs,and goats. They need to be groomed,fed,watered,and watched over. Sometimes you'd have to stay up all night to watch over the animals.

I'm not saying you won't have any time to yourself on the boat. when you go to pick up the animals you can read,play baseball,or tennis in a lower deck or you could take long cat naps.

My point is you would be doing a good deedfor many people. You'd be serveing your country. You'd also have a gran adventure and have fun!
