Limiting the car usage can have multi advantages for everysingle citizen. reducing car usage can help citizens to live a better life,which mean it can make them happier,healthier and more sociable. for example heidrun walter says "when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way."this  show the effects of limiting the car usage." after days of near-record pollution,paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.''goverments are now being concius on how cars can affect us todays but, more in a future about pollution. ''the smog rivaled beijing,china, which is know as one of the most polluted cities in the world.'' the cause for this problem are cars. in beijing,china, citizens and tourist are having problems to breath and the smog is causin health problems too.''its a good opportunity to take aways stress and lower the air pollution,''in bogota colombia another citizen name carlos arturo  talk about how the reduce of car usage have taken ways the stressand helps to lower the air pollution which is going to help our kids ain a future to have a better life. another important fact is that is car usage is that citizens would have to walk or exercise by using bicycle or other methods to move around the citie which the effect could be everybody having  healthier lifeand have a better social life wich in some cases helps the person to be able to be themselves.

i think people should be concius and start reducing their car usage becasue is only for theis benefit but for other or even something more importantr their families. car companies are going to be affected by this change. but their going to be more affective in a future when they see what they have done. not only for the human race but for theis loved members. so i think the advantages of limiting tha car usage is good in many ways but their still one factor is going to bother people like going to some places really far away to see some of theirs family members.
