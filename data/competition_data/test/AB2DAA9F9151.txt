I disagree with the principal because, not everyone wants to do an extracurricular activity such as sports or clubs. firstly, if your disabled in any kind of way you will feel left out because you don't have as many options as the other kids without disabilities because if you were born without a limb you most likely wouldn't be in the sporting scene any time soon. the truth is the coaches will usually pay more attention to a strong person with all limbs and no disablilities rather than a kid walking on one leg trying to try out for the sport. which is very discriminative of the kids like that so, this soon to be plan should be cancellled before it ever cpomes to action it will cause so much sadness and despair thats not really worth it.

Secondly, mentally being prepared for having to do all of that stuff, it could really wreck your mental state trying to do better and better but then your club or sports team looks down upon you for not being able to compete with them. so if the principal does go through with this plan he will have to hire more guidance councelors to help all the kids be in better mental state which he didn't say he would do. im thinking this will just wreck more kids physdically and mentally by being exausted all the time with even more school work than before because now you have an extra class or sport to worry about and on top of that its mandatory. if i was in the situation honestly i'd want to be homeschooled so don't have to go through so much teasing and hatred being thrown at me for not being as good as the other kids at the sport or club im in.

Third, sociality, this can wreck a person or it could help them i think being in a specific club or sport that people say is weak or weird will make people get bullied more by other students because they want to do something they enjoy but everyone else will just bully them for it. say if somebody created a club called superhero club where kids wouild dress up like superheros for that class personally i'd look down upon those kids because that seems pretty weird they would get bullied for it even though they find it fun and funny because thats jsut the way society works. its pretty unfortunate but the guidance councelors i talked about earlier could help try and stop the bullying but it probably wont stop that easily. but if I made a club called sports club everyone in that ckub will be looked at like normal people evn if they paint their face strange colors and wear random peoples jerseys they will still be looked at as "cool."

Fourthly, personality, because if your more nerdy but want to join the sports club you will be swiftly declined even if your good at sports because the people will just look at you for your reputation, the way you dress and your personalitity. most of the time rather thna not the mean and evil peole will succeed in school reputation but if your a nice person usually people just won't know who you are or just thinks their a weirdo which does suck beacause unfortunately the mean and evil people get hyped up to becoome a bully then the nice kids do something horrible. which is unfortunate to say the least, but there is one way to change it tell a teacher or a parent about whats happening to avert a crisis if the bullying still doesen't stop and the bully starts assualtimng or hitting you for not being mean like them you can contact the police about the issue and it will be solved real quick. their is another reason why people get bullied and those kids that get bullied commit a crime or something worse, because everyuone will call you a "snitch" even though what you did literally could have saved your life by informing a parent, teacher or the police about the misshap.

Finally, religion, if your christian you won't get bullied ever and if you somehow do, its probably because your not in america. but if your muslim wearing those turbans and stuff you will be sterotyped a lot and people will probably try and pull it off of you because it looks kind of strange. also if you believ in the chinese religions people i n school and out of school will usually say things to make you mad like ching chong min mong even though none of that is chinese. because people just look for something or someone to make miserable to make themselves feel wanted and dominant over the other person like a god or something because those people or the "bullies" will ruin your life for anything sometimes religion. also if you belive in a certain thing like god then people will look at you as normal or chill but if you believe in a another giod like budha peole will make a lot of jokes about budha and you because they find it funny in a mean way.
