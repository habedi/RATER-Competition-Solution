Why are summer projects student-designed instead of being teacher-designed? They are designed for students to learn about a specific subject that could teach them about a lot of things that they haven't heard about before doing the project. Student-designed summer projects represents new information, the amount of time it has been worked on, and the possibility of helping the society. Summer projects will help a student during their summer break to keep learning new things in the world and develop facts about them.

Firstly, student-designed summer projects shows new information to students rather than a teacher. A teacher taught themselves to know the knowledge that a student would need in their future life, so making a project would increase the knowledge of a student. Projects during the summer break could actually help a student to remember everything that they learned and teach others about it to where people will learn new things in their life. When a student is able to give people details about what they learned during the summer, it would be added to the brain of the person to know what to do or how to do something. Information given from a student would stay in their mind for a long time to recollect, but a person will try to prove them wrong, so that they will get the point of the argument until the student is able to show the facts that they are the correct individual. Students collect facts of their subject and study them to show to the teacher of how much new information has helped them in knowing something they didn't know before working on the project.

Secondly, student-designed summer projects shows the amount of time the student has been working on making the project. Timing of a project can represent how determined a student wants to learn about a new subject, so they could use all of the facts and put it into their project. If a student is taking days to weeks to finish the project they are going to make a spectacular presentation to the students and the teacher that will give them an extra boost in their knowledge. A student that takes only a day to work on their project wouldn't care about the facts they learn, even though it is important to learn everything that they need to learn to be smarter with facts that could come in their future. It shouldn't take a long time for a student to work on their project and not finish it in time to where they don't have the information, and it will show how irresponsible the student can be of not working on their project.

The project should be filled with real information to where students can use it and transfer it to other students brain as they would have the possibility of taking a test or quiz on the information that was given to them. Testing or taking a quiz on a subject that the student have done a project on should be easy for all the students who learned a new fact.

Thirdly, student-designed summer project helps society to do better and not make it worse to where it will become a deserted area or bad society. A summer project about helping society would influence people to care for their society to always clean it instead of trashing the area making it look dirty that no one wants to come near it and help people, so that nothing bad will happen to their society and no one will make it a bad area. Society creates a place to where Americans can be comfortable around each other having them to express their emotions publicly and getting the attention of people to care about them. It also creates a space to where people wouldn't like it based on the people that lives there having it to be seen as a bad society that no one who wants to live in a good society would consider to live or visit in that area. Americans can help society from becoming a bad society and a deserted area by taking care of the area and citizens who are in need of help before they make the society to be bad. If the society becomes to be not a good society everyone who lived there would leave and decide to live in a bigger area that has a better society.

However, teacher-designed summer project will give the teacher the same information that they already knew before, but a student-designed summer project would actually teach the students new information of their subject during the summer. When a student is doing a project during the summer it would be intriguing to the students to keep learning and show everything they have in their brain to offer to other students improving their knowledge too. Teachers are able to learn the information as they study hard to give the students the same information, so a student should be able to do the same thing and achieve a better grade for their summer project. Student-designed summer projects can show their capability of getting the facts and information of their subject to where they would gain ideas on how to make their project connect to other students mindset on it.

In Conclusion, summer projects are required to be student-designed to help students to learn new information and develop facts in the world. It teaches the students new information, the amount of time the project has to be done, and a way of helping their society to know in their future life. Summer projects are a good requirement for students to learn new things during their summer break.
