Dear Principle,

I have considered both points of view on the issue of changing the average grade for students participating in sports from a C to a B and feel that this would be an appropriate thing to do. Not only does having students at a C average mean that they are potentially lazy, but it indicates that if the student is willing to work for the team, they can show dedication to their schoolwork allowing them to become better students in the classroom.

On one hand, making all student athletes obtain a B average means that the student is not lazy. It shows that they work hard and want to achieve greatness in both their school and in their sports. Many children already are earning a B average on sporting teams at school, so why not make it mandatory for those other students to pick up the pace? This new rule wouldn't necessarily affect everybody on school sports teams, just the few that need an extra push. This is an excellent idea and should be proposed so that students don't get lazy and have only one main priority.

Additionally, this type of rule shows dedication to all students that working hard does indeed pay off. It gives student athletes something to strive for and something that will push them to work better. Making it mandatory for students participating in sports to have a B average or higher allows them to fully put their minds to both priorities. I know many people that feel they don't have to try as hard to do well in school because they just need a C average for sports. This type of mentality gets students nowhere later in life and will teach them to only do what is required. Having all student athletes obtain a B average shows dedication towards the athletes themselves.

In conclusion, making it mandatory for student participating in sports have a B average or higher is a smart thing to do not only in the minds of the faculty, but in the minds of the students themselves. I for one believe that this is a very bright idea and should be in affect rather soon. Having student athletes obtain a B average or higher ensures that the students are not lazy, and allows them to have goals and dedication towards the things they are doing. This is a superb idea and is a magnificent thing for the students, parents, and teachers.

Sincerely,
