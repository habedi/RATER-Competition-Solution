Phones and Driving

In this day and age you could not go anywhere without seeing a cell phone. It is obvious that they are a very important part of our society today. However a big problem and debate that everyone has is whether or not they should be aloud for use while driving. They can take your focus off of the task at hand which could be dangerous. However I believe that they should be allowed for use while driving.

In the car, a cell phone can be very useful. One big thing it is used for is maps. You can use your cell phone to look up your destination. Without the use of your maps you could get lost around town. Or stuck somewhere that you do not want to be. This could see to be dangerous so your cell phone could help you.

Another reason I personally believe they should be used is for music. I do not believe I could find many people to agree with me on this one if I am being honest. However, the music is very important to some people and it can help concentration while driving. It can keep you awake if you are tired. I think it is safe, as long as you just shuffle a playlist and do not stay looking at your phone to change songs.

Cell phones all around can be very helpful when it comes to driving. They can help your focus with music so you're not falling asleep behind the wheel. They can also help you not get lost in the middle of nowhere. So as long as you are safe and aware I think cell phones can be beneficial to driving.
