The author supports the idea well that Venus is a worthy planet to study. The way that people can study venus is to stay above the surface in a blimp, they could build space crafts and rovers out of the strongest material on Earth, and they could also make a submarine like vehicle that is strong enough to with stand the heat and the preasure.

The fact that Venus is a planet that is close to us should make it easy to go to. It is not easy because of the preasure and the heat. A way to get around these issues is to make a blimp that will stay above the surface of the world so then it only gets part of the preasure and heat. Then they can try to get evidence and samples from the surface of the planet to bring back with them to study on earth.

They could get the strongest material on Earth and use it to make space crafts and rovers that will with stand the full heat and preasure. Then the rover could collect samples of gases and rocks. It could also get photographs and videos of what the surface looks like. It could then take everything back to Earth and then humans could study the diffrent samples it collected.

They could make a submarine like vehicle that can withstand the preasure. If they do that then they can collect the samples and figure out if Venus had life on it before. They could find out if Venus could become a new home for humans if it is needed. Then the submarine could send all of the evidence back and then we can study all the evidence we need to study to learn more about Venus.

In Counclusion, they need to make a vehicle out of the strongest material to send down to the suface of Venus and try to collect samples. Then the vechile will come back to Earth with the diffrent materials and then humans would get to work on studying the samples.
