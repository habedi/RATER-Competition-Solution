Cars are a very useful means of transportation, but there are advantagess to limiting the usage of cars. The use of cars creates greenhouse gas emissions, creates smog, backs up traffic, and depletes our natural resources. Limiting the usage of cars can decrease all that, along with improving safety. There has already been places to have test a "car-free" environment, such as, Germany, Paris, and Colombia. All of which had positive results.

The use of cars may not seem it, but actually causes more of an inconvinence and takes up a lot of space that can be use for other things. If there were to be no cars, stores would be placed in walking distance. This is where cars are inconvienent. Because so many people own cars, stores don't build in walking distance, but instead in malls along distant highways. People can't just walk and get whatever it is they want, but instead wait forever in traffic jams to get to a store and then wait again to get back home. We also lose a lot of space because of cars. Lands that could be used to built for parks,  bycicle paths, ect., are instead used to make garages, or parking areas for cars.

One of the most worst things that is caused by the use of cars is air pollution. The emissions from tail pipes creates greenhouse gases. In fact, passenger cars are resposible for twelve percent of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United states. Another effect of using cars is smog. Paris had actually banned the use of cars at a point to lower the levels of smog, and diesel fule was blamed. People were fined for driving cars, and delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but the limited use of cars helped clear the smog.

There are ways to limit the use of cars, not just in means of driving less, but by the number of those who are driving. People can limit the use of cars by changing the type of transportation they use. For example, instead of driving everday, a person could take a public bus to get to where they need to go, or that person could car pool with others that they  know. A person could even organize the majority of what they do to where they rarely are need of a vehicle, and simply walk. There are many advantages to lowering the use of cars. It reduces greenhouse gases, lowers the level of smog, and it conserves our natural resources.
