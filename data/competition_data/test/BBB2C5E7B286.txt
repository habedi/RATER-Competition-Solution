An extracurricular activity is an activity that you do outside of your normal everyday life. It could at school during school hours, after school, or with another program on the weekends. I think that you should have to participate in an extracurricular activity so your life is more full. You will be more involved in the school, it will be fun, and you can be happy by doing so. It will also raise the school spirit and get it flowing within the school and in the community.

By be part of an extracurricular activity you will be more involved. You would be more involved because you are doing more than just coming to school, doing work, and going home to do it over again. You have more to do than just schoolwork.

When you are involved, you are having fun. Extracurricular activities can range anywhere from doing the school newspaper, to being of the football team, or joining a local scout troop. There is an activity outside of school for almost anything. Whatever your taste there is probably an activity for it so you can have fun doing what you want. It may take some time to find he right one, but whatever you like to do, there is for sure an activity for it.. No matter what the activity is, when you are doing it and like it, you will be having fun.

You can be happy when you feel involved in things and are having fun. It has been proven that when you are involved in things you feel happier than you did before. For an example...

You weren't involved with any extracurricular activities and you had nothing to do when you got home nut talk to your friends when they were done with there sports. You felt something missing, so you decided to go play baseball that spring. You made the team and you were liking the game. You felt happier with yourself than you did when you weren't doing anything before.

Things like these do happen, and they happen to a lot of people too. You can have so much fun when doing an extracurricular activity.

In closure, extracurricular activities can be so much fun and be a big part of your life. They are fun, exciting, involving, and make you happy. I think that every school should make you do some sort of extracurricular activity in or out of school. They are really fun and make change the way you go and do things.
