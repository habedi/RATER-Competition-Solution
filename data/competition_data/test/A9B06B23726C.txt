i belive that a electoral college COULD work if you get a proper way of selecting so it stated that there are 538 electors meaning 538 ideas and this is just facts the majority of people who are there are white not saying that thats wrong but what i am saying is that we need equal races so lets say three presidents are to pick from one is white(democratic) the second one is hispanic (republican) (more specificly mexican you will see why thats important later) and the third is african american(republican) so the 538 electors lets say 421 of them are white and 90 are african american so now total is 511 and now lets say 27 are hispanic (all races of hispanic) so I AM NOT saying that all the whites are gonna pick the white one. and all hispanic ones are gonna pick the hispanic ones etc. but i am saying that since 421 are white there gonna have a thing in comman with the white president why because there white same with all the races in the college but more specificly the white ones because of there past so i sugggest that we have and equal or close to equal amount of all races so americans korean mexican irish german polish chinease ghana etc. etc.

now like i said in the first paragraph the hispanic one in mexican now why that would be important is that since he is mexican a lot of ignorant people are gonna say he cant be president he needs to be born in merica well that is true but the thing is he is from america but his ethnicity is mexican so realy i should have refraised that he is mexican american meaning that the little loop whole has just been closed so he can be president but for the people who are still dumb and cant exept another race you still have hope if you look on the map of american the electoral college with the sencond most electors is in good old texas with 38 voters (the most goes to cali but thats not important) and what does texas have well one of the highest rates of mexican imigrants one of the highests numbers of kkk members you know racist stuff so yea with texas having one of the most i dont see an colored president in a long time i still have now idea why another guy cant be friends with some one cause there colored life is like a box of crayons one color the people like more and all the others they hate cant we all just be color blind so now im gonna hit you with some truth because the states with some of the highest rate of blacks and hispanics also have the lowest number of electors im not saying that the goverment said colored people there lets give them 5 voters its like that because the states with more black and hispanic people are also some of the poorest states in america so its not all the goverments fault good job america.

so how do we fix that well i say that the goverment should send money to not only to the state itself but to the citys in them so give some money to detroit and chigago without them we wouldent have the worst team in the nba (just kidding) and a team that had a legend so i also say take the number of states with more electors and transfer them to the smaller ones so take 10 from texas and give them to main and 15 from cailfonia and give them to all small state know what im saying or nah.

so on to the next thing that they need to fix so it says that the most populer vote becomes presidet seems pretty legit exept for the fact that its not legit at all if have some one that has done so much like serve in the military fought in afginistan or somthing like and he can do oficial stuff then he deserves it but if a actor runs for president some one like eddy murphey vs obama whos gonna win starts with and e and ends with a y who is it eddy murpey he will always win how do you think arnald shwazinager became govener of califonia and i know he had so skill if office but still a old man who uses steroids vs a middle aged man who know alot about being a president so i say we should get rid of the populer vote and pick the one with skill we should let the three best run america for one month each and see how each one does at the if we lose evrething well then they weren a good president now were they so yea it could work.
