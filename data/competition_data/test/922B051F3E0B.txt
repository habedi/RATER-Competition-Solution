My reason to go on the trip was it would be an amazing experience. I loved the idea of going around the world.

I seemed to arrive in the places just as the wars were ending so it was good timing. I told people that it was a really good experience and I enjoyed my trip. I went to New Orleans,Greece,Italy,and China on my adventures of being a seagoing cowboy. I would really suggest being a seagoing cowboy expecially if you are someone who wants to travel or enjoys traveling. My argument to go is this could be a once ina lifetime offer like it was for me. If you get the oppurtunity i would really take. I know if i got offered again I would take it it's a really amazing way to see the world and experience other cultures.

It is always a good oppurtunity to experience new cultures and learn new things. You never know what you are going to like. Like some peole you might even end up living in another country because you enjoy their culture so much. There are also other things cultures have that you might like to try like foods and different ways of living. Many cultures have different lifestyles that you might like.

I really hope this convinced you to go ahead and go on the trip. This could be one more thing that you miss out on because you weren't willing to take a chance and experience new cultures. I really suggest going like I said I had a good time on my trip and really enjoyed it.
