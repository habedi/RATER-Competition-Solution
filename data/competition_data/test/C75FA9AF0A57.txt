The "Seagoing Cowboys" Program.

Luke's participation in the "Seagoing Cowboys" program allows him to experience adventures and visit many unique places. I think many of you should join this program. Here are my reasons why you should join this program: you can save someone,you get a nice experience by traveling to different countries, and when your done doing your job you can hangout with the other cowboys.

My first reason is that you can save someone. You can save a life since the "Seagoing Cowboys" program is all about taking care of horses,young cows, and mules ,and shipping them overseas to other countries to help people out. Luke knew if he signed up he can help rescue people in trouble. Think about it for a second. You can also help save someone who has suffered because of the war.

My second reason is that you can get a unique experience. Have you ever wanted to travel to China or Europe? Well you can if you join this program since the "Seagoing Cowboys" program travels to many places to ship animals. Luke got to experience China,Europe, but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special to him. Luke also taked a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. You can get a one of a kind experience from this.

My third reason is that when you are done with your job you can just relax. Also you can go play with the other cowboys sports in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Luke had found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. It is not all about doing work there is some fun in it too.

In conclusion, these are my reasons on why you should join this program. You can get a good experience if you join this program. Bieng a Seagoing Copwboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world for him. "I am grateful for the opportunity," he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." he says. That awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students, and exchange visitors for many years. I hope my essay has persuaded you to join this program.
