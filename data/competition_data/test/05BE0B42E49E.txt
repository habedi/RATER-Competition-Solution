I strongly believe people should join and be a seagoing cowboy. If you like riding at sea and love animals this is a job for you. Have you ever wondered how other countries are? Or ever wnted to go to another country.

Well now you have an opportunity to see lots of other countries.

You can save peoples lives. In some countries they don't have the food we do. The least we can do is help them get a boost. And some countries need animals so they can have food or transportation. It will give you a good experience. But if you get sea sick, ect. You are not fit for this job. Just think about if you were one of those people, no food, no animals,no transportation. You may think that you could be away from your family and it's a waste of time but think of it this way, there are other families out there just like you, hungry starving. Or could already be dead,lets not let that happen to any more families.

This is a one in a life time opportunity. You can save alot of lives from hunger. Afterwards once the animals are all unloaded you can have some fun. You can play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,games will make things seem quicker. You can also have a good feeling in your heart for helping others. Think about others, care about others.
