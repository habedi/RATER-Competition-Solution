In 1976, the spacecraft Viking 1 took a photo of a certain area on Mars. When NASA saw the photo, they saw what looked like a face. However, many years later, the Face turned out to be a natural formation, like a mesa is on Earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This proves that the Face is not an alien artifact. Also, NASA has found no other evidence of alien life on Mars, so the chances that the Face is made by aliens go down even more. Some people still believe that this Face has something do to with aliens. Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding evidence from us, and that they don't want us to know about aliens on Mars. This theory is also disproved. Jim Garvin said that it's hard work to get photographs of the area, so why would NASA work so hard to get pictures of the Face if they wanted to hide it? Furthermore, NASA would love to find an ancient alien civilization, and would probably share it if they did find something. Finally, there is one more piece of evidence that the Face wasn't made by aliens. There are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face. I would give an example but I cant do any research because this is a test. The reasons above prove that the landform on Mars known as the Face, is NOT made by aliens.
