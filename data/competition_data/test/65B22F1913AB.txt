In 1945 world war 2 just ended and a kid named Luke Boberger is about to have a once in a life time opportunity. Its 1945 at a high school graduation Luke is talking to his friend Don Reist until suddenly Don asked Luke if he wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat with him but Luke couldn`t say no to Don but world war 2 had ended and there is a lot of homes ,facrories,grocery stores,and malls destroyed and in ruins and need to recover there food and animals and so 44 nations had came together to form the UNRRA

(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation.

So the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to go to Europe and take care of the horses,young cows,and even mules that were coming from overseas so Luke and Don sighned up to help with the animals and Europe. So in August of 1945 Luke and Don got their orders to go to New Orleans. So on August 14 Luke and Don arrived in New Orleans the day the Pacific war was over both Luke and Don got their seaman`s papers and boarded in a ship called the SS Charles W. Wooster and was heading to Greece with a cargo filled with 335 horses plus a lot of hay and oats to feed the horses.

So before Luke got to Greece he turned 18 which means that means that Luke can be drafted into the military service. So after Luke and Don did there seagoing cowboys they both had some fun on the ship like where they housed the animals they played in there table-tennis, tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading. whittling,and games that also helped pass the time.
