Would you ever make something that would put you in any kind of harm ?. Making Driverless car has negative aspects such as harming innocent people. In the text it says '' If technology fails andsomeone is injuried , who is at fault '' this could be a fifty fifty chance that you could be accountable if the person is seriously harmed.

The first reason why I think that the Driverless car shouldn't be out is because why would a person want a driverless car if they still would have to drive it thereselves. Peolple want driverless cars so they sit back and the let car do all the driving. The car can just make you start driving and you wouldn't even know it.

Why would the law let a car like this even touch the streets if it can put anyone around at risk of getting injuried, or lives ruined. I dont believe that the car is reliably safe. what if the car gives you a late signal that if need for some human skills to take over and a small child was ran over by one of these monster you call a car ?.

So I ask woul you make something that would put your life and other in harms way ?. This is my opinon on the driverless car. They shouldn't be out with the community.
