To the principal:

I do not think that all students should be required to participate in community service. I think the students should be free to choose whether they want to help out their community or not. Even though I would recommend doing it, I disagree with the idea of making the students help out.

I know community service is a good thing, and everyone should participate in it, forcing them to do it takes away the fun, contrary to working on your own time with your friends and/or family. Also many of the students who would enjoy being required to do community service are already doing some on their own, while others who don't, probably would work very little while doing with the school.

I, for example, do community service with the scouting program, and sometimes with my family, while my friend, who isn't in the scouting program, doesn't do much service at all, and requiring him to do the service would just be more work for everyone. Plus my friend, and many others, would have a miserable time, while helping out very little.

If you require students to perform community server they are probably going to get stuck with a job they like worse than others, say one kid wants to tutor a student, and another wants to go help out at the soup kitchen, if you require the whole school to go pick up litter around town neither of the students would have a good time. The other students might have gone to do the things they wanted, had a fun time, and probably would have done a better job with that way of helping out.

Students may have something else important they should be doing, but instead they are forced to do community service. For example, a student may have an important sports game, like the finals in a tournament, but if they have to miss it to perform community service with the school their team could lose, and then they would be disappointed in their teammate

So even though helping out the community is something I recommend doing, it isn't right to require it and make many students uncomfortable.
