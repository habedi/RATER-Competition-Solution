The Facial Action Coding System also know as FACS reads amotions according to your facial exprestions, but some people do have the same amotion on their face as they are really feeling. They put on an act for everyone a person can be really sad in side and yet put a smile on their face and fake it till they make it, just so people do not pick up on that. They said nothing in this artical about how FACS was going to read the real emotions of someone just their facial exprestion. Someone can also have a resting angry fave when really they are just okay or they are happy but the look on their face says that they are angery. Not one time in the artical did they metion how that was going to work, FACS can not truly work unless it can read the persons mind, because they could be thinking something intierly diffrent than what they are showing.
