In order to explain, Why is it important that you must participate in at least one particular activity. I am going to give u some examples and some reasons about why you must participate in at least one activity.

First, I agree that you must participate in at least one particular activity because its fun for you and you'll be busy in some work. If you do participate in at least one activity you will get a better grade, have some fun, and you will be busy in some work. If you do participate, you will get a chance to present what have you made about. You will get a chance to represent your self infront of your whole school and your friends and they will know about your confidence and your hard work then you are gonna get a better and best grade.

Also,If you do not participate then you just have to sit and look at other people what they are doing and busy in some work for their grade. If you do not participate then you will not get a better grade and you will not get a chance to represent your self in front of everyone and you will not get a better grade. The principal, your teacher, and your friends will not get a chance to know how confident you are and how much you worked hard on your project or your work.

In Conclusion, to support my reasons you must have to participate in at least one activity and describe your self how confident and how hard working person you are. Finally, that was all the reasons and examples why you must participate in at least one activity.
