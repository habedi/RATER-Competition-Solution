Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service seems to becoming a big problem her in our local community. I believe that students here at SCHOOL_NAME should be required to help out around our community and well do some community service. To make a community strong and united we have to work together to keep our community clean and healthy and this includes the people living in our community also. Below I am going to list some ideas on how to get our school to help around our community to make it a better environment.

Pollution seems to be a huge deal around not only Crestview, but the whole Okaloosa County. I have come up with an idea that 10 students be selected from each grade every week, to go out and clean up the "litter" on our local highways. Pollution is something that can eventually wear away our ozone layer. So I believe that it is our duty as SCHOOL_NAME to take part in whatever we can to make our world a safe and healthy environment.

If you like this idea I would be glad to discuss further details with you.

The most important part of a community is the people who make up the population of the community. Crestview is a town where everyone pretty much knows everyone, I think it would be a great idea to help out at our local nursing homes. Helping the elderly is always good, they love to see children's bright smiling faces. We could donate items at the school that we are getting or wanting to get rid, we can also cook meals for them. The community really needs strong young leaders to take control and get the job done that needs to be done around the community, and I believe that kids that make up SCHOOL_NAME middle school are the kids who can eventually make our community a better place for everyone.

Who doesn't love a giddy little fund raiser, where you can buy everything you can think of. We really need to build new community center in Crestview and to carry that plan out we could do fund raisers. Fund raisers are a fun way of helping your community, I mean who knew that helping your community could be so much fun? Not only are you helping the community out of the goodness of your heart, but whenever you fund raise do you usually receive prizes? I believe you do, so this is a good way to help get kids to participate and help out around the community.

Overall TEACHER_NAME I believe that it is an awesome idea to have our kids here at SCHOOL_NAME to work together and complete community service. It would make our community happy and healthy for everyone!
