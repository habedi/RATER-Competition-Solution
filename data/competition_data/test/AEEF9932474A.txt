The author aslo doesn't uses any first pronoun in his or her reading. Therefore, the author did a great job explaning his claim.

First the author gives you some background information about Venus, that was an amazing job. Not everybody is going to understand what your talking about unuse you inform them with some information. The text states in paragraph one, "Venus, sometimes called the Evening Star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot." Another quote from the text states in paragrapgh one, " However, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet." The auothor states how Venus and Earth may once been the most look alike planets. The auothor also states why humans can't get to the land on Venus.

Overall, the author did amazing job at explaning how he felt about this stiutation. Includng details and supporting his claims perfectly.
