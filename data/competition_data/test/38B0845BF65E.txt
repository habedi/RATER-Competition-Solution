The idea of a driverless car has been an idea only meant for science fiction films. The concept of the whole idea seemed as though people would not see in their life time. Until now, engineers and scientists are closing in on the idea that self driving cars are a thing of today. Top car manufacturers are now developing ideas and ways to bring us closer of this once fascinating dream, into a reality. To wake up some day and simply send a text or call a local business to send a driverless car to give them a ride to where ever they need to go. Also, the amount of time saved for people not having to car for their cars and take them to body shops and pay high prices for problems in the engine.

But before the idea can pick up even more on its popularity; some people may ask what would its use be?

There many young adults and teenagers who still have not received their drivers liscense and have to wait on a parent or guardian to come pick them up from school, activity, or sporting event. With the self driving car, those people may some day just call or text a business operating the cars to come and pick them up and drive them home. This method would relieve the stress of the parents having to drive there and wait on their loved ones. This method may also be used to replace the tradtional taxi driving system. The traditional taxi system was said to be unsafe under certain situations. for example the taxi driver can manipulate the customer if the customer is unaware of the streets and driver can then take the longest route to charge a substainally high price for a drive that was not suppose to take as long. With the driverless car, the car will not manipulate the customer and reach its destination at an efficient time and price. Along with the amount of fuel saved from the driverless car, our economy may no longer rely on fossil fuel as a sufficient source of energy for our cars.

Another reason why the driverless car idea might be successful is the lives it could save for the drivers who are not paying attention. some cars may not be driverless but the ones who can break before the driver can react is amazing. A popular car with the system that the car can break before you can react is Subaru. Subaru has always been popular with its safety features, but now, with the newest models, the car is now capable of stopping itself before an accident can occur. How this works is that this car isn't necessarily driverless, it is still a driver needed car. But what makes this car stand out in safety is its sensors in the front and the back of the car. it is used to detect any situations or actions of other drivers that can start an accident. In one scenerio, a lady is backing up her car from her driveway and is distracted by her child in the back, not realizing she was still backing up the car's sensors detected an oncoming vehicle and immediatly stopping the car. The car saved the lady and her child from injury and the lady will notdeal with insurance for damages and costs of repairs. This is just one of the dozens of scenarios that can happen when a driver is not paying attention and could lead to serious accidents. With smart technology we can save the lives of millions of drivers whose accidents could have been prevented.

in conclusion, the idea of driverless cars is still a thing to be worked on and in need of improvement. But we are not far from seeing cars without drivers driving safer and more efficiently than human drivers. Not to mention the growth the economy will have from people switching from buses and uncomfortable rides with strangers. driverless car will not harm other drivers or harm how we see cars, instead we will see them as a safe, efficient, and well protected vehicle for transportation. Even if we do not succeed in having driverless car, we still have had many advancements from keeping drivers safe and preventing accidents that could be saved.
