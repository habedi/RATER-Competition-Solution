Dear Mrs. Principal,

I am writing you concerning our possible change in policy. I both agree and disagree with your idea on change the grade level average.

I disagree with you on this term: most of the students who participate in the sport activities have a grade level lower than your expectations. By changing this policy, you are eliminating most of the players who are committed to the sport activities. The majority of the students who also play sports try to keep their grades up, but have a hard time doing so because of the sports, yes. But this does not mean that the students don't care enough to learn. It might be that they do not understand what they are being taught, but they just don't want to voice that they don't understand. The change in policy will only make them feel panicked and their grades will drop even furthe. If they are given the chance to fully understand the lessons, like a private tutor, they will be able to get their grades up and keep them that way, hopefully getting rid of the shyness to voice their misunderstandings. Their performance in school and in the sport they play will be better if the policy is not changed.

I agree with you on this point, however: some students just don't care enough to learn. They would rather be out on the field or shooting some hoops. By changing the policy, you give them a reason to learn what they are being taught. If you eliminate the ability to participate in said sport, it will give them more time to focus on the schoolwork they need to get done. Once they do spend more time on their homework, they will be able to get their grade up to expectations, and hopefully keep it there once they rejoin the team. By having the policy changed their drive to learn will be increased, even if they dislike the idea, and it will help them later on in life.

Sincerely Yours,
