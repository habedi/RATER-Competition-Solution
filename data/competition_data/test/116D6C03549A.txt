Remember that moment on the last day of school, right before summer break? Remember the mid-day naps and late nights spent with friends? Remember the horrifying moment of realization that your summer project is due in less than a week; and you haven't even started? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continuation of learning over their break. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to choose a project according to their own personal interest, it would be less confusing for the student and parent(s), and the student is more likely to prepare and produce a quality project.

Many families have exciting activities planned for the summer time. They travel and explore new things with their children, helping the kids develop an interest in different things and the desire to discuss them. Allowing students to choose and design their own projects gives them the opportunity to express their interests. It also allows the teacher to evaluate their skills and learn about the student. My cousin is very fond of rocks andÂ the rock cycle. For his summer project, his teacher allowed him to design it himself and he created an elaborate project on the rock cycle. His teacher later contacted his mother and praised him on his creativity and knowledge of rocks. Through the use of student-designed projects, the teacher was able to discuss the areas that he needed improvement in and identify his interest.

Doing work that teachers give you can be difficult, especially if they aren't around to help clarify their requirements. Student-designed projects would be more efficient because it would be less confusing on the students and the parents. Parents often attempt to assist their children with their projects, but it can be difficult understanding what is needed and sometimes the child ends up receiving a low score. Last year, I had a summer project prompt that I didn't understand. Naturally, I went to my mother for help. She gave great advice and answered my questions, but when I turned in the project I received a sixty-seven. The teacher said that I hadn't answered the prompt correctly. I was confused because my mother had helped me with the prompt. The teacher sat down and explained what it was she was looking for and gave me the opportunity to make up my grade. If my project had been student-designed, the teacher would've had minimal involvement in the project allowing me to put it together in a way I would have understood, eliminating confusion.

No one likes being rushed to do things they don't feel like doing. Students are more likely to prepare and produce a quality project if it is something they want to do. Most students struggle with time management for the simple fact that the things they need to do aren't interesting. There's homework, chores and sometimes work. Summer projects shouldn't be another boring task assigned by a teacher, it should be up to the student. When you give the student control over their task they will want to complete it in a timely fashion and they will make sure it is their very best work because they want to take pride in its uniqueness. It's like dance competitions. The dancers are allowed to choreograph whatever they want as long as the dance fits the assigned dance style. They are then graded on technique, creativity, and skill. If schools made summer projects student-designed, students would be more motivated to do them because they can make them as interactive and different as they want.

Having summer projects helps the teacher keep track of the progress of learning over the summer. Summer projects should be a simple way for students to express their interest and have fun.
