Dear principal,

I have read the policies you have considered for the use of cell phones during school hours. In my perspective i agree with policy number two. My reasoning is because if you allow students to bring cell phones to school and only let them use phones during lunch periods and other free times they will most likely not obey the rule to turn them off during class time because some might claim "they forgot to turn them off" or they "didn't have time to."

Although, if you completely ban phones from being on school property there won't be any chances of cell phones being in school classrooms. In addition to not having phones in school students will be able to focus on their academics better. During free time they could do extra credit projects or study for tests and quizzes without the distraction of their cell phones. With policy number two it might even benefit students with their grades. The students most likely won't agree with this policy and are probably hoping for policy number one, in the long term they will become more successful and do better in school.

If you choose to go with policy number one students won't get any benefits out of it other than a few conversations on their cell phones with friends. As you may know students occasionally brake the rules and you'll probably catch a few kids texting during class and did not turn their cell phone off like they were supposed to. Please think about my decision and realize the students will be more successful people in the end with policy number two, instead of wasting their free time calling or texting someone.

thank you
