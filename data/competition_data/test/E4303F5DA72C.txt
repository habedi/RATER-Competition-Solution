Dear Mr. Principle,

I have been thinking about the problem you have presented us, and I think I have the solution.

As you have told us we have two groups, one of which is opposing the terms of the community service proposition, and the other group which is agreeing with the terms of the community service proposition.

I am part of the agreeing group and I am writing this letter to help support our groups position on this proposition.

Some of the reasons I feel the way I do is because of the way some of the areas where community service projects have already taken place.

There is so much of a difference in the way the place looks and it only took a couple of days with maybe two hours a day!

Now tell me that's a not a good trade off! Better looking landscape and it builds character for the students doing the work.

It also makes the community proud of what it has accomplished and taught its next generation.

If you don't know what i mean when I say, "taught its next generation", I mean taught them that if they better their community they better themselves.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
