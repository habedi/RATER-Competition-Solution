When new technology comes out it can always be a positive thing. That its better to have something than not to have it. having a computer that can determine if we are sad, happy, bored, etc. is pretty crazy. without this technology we probably wouldnt be able to determine that the Mona Lisa is prodomitly happy. That a computer can do something that humans do everyday when we look at someone.

That having the ability of computers that can read students faces, in my opinion is valuable and can be used in many ways.

There are many ways that the computer can be used, if someone were to put the computer in a everyday public school classroom. They can detect and figure out what learning style kids like. this can be implimented and put to use in classrooms around the world and help get kids more into school and want to try to get an education. This can make school more fun and more intresting for kids today. differetn classrooms can have different styles and you have a variety of kids per classroom and test to see what style the kids like. when the results come back teachers and staff can go over them and the more majority of kids that like a certian teaching style can be the style that is implimeanted in the schools today This is all done by seeing what facial emotions are used by the kids.

Another way that the ability of reading students emotions can help, is to have the ability detect how students are feeling and even when they are trying to hide how they are feeling. When you are a teenager you have lots of crazy and mixed feelings. Sometimes a student might go into a deep depression and his or her friends might not be able to detect the the fact of what they are feeling and they might do something to themselves that might not be a good thing. If you use this device and cna detect how they are feeling you could stop that student from harming his or her self from doing this. This can save lots of lives and stop death rates all around the world and help that student to get help and stop this from happening. This is all done from a technology that can read facial emotions and can be very useful and even save ones life.

Having this technology can be nice, but sometimes it cant always be right. If we use this technology it doesnt always mean that it can be helpful or can detect what really kids are thinking. Sometimes you can put on a brave face and show the world what really inside thats not what you are thinking. The computer migh pick up the brave face you are showing and say that you are happy but really you are having a bad day and you really arent happy. When you use this technology for schools and the computer detects the faces wrong then you have spent all of this money to have the computers detect how the faces of the kids are showing and the results really arent true then you have just wasted lots of time and that is not necessary to have. We dont really know what people are feeling. Mona lisa may not be 83 percent happy and 9 percent disgusted, etc. She may be 10 percent happy and 90 percent digusted, etc. there no good way to determine what she was really feeling at that time and in that picture.

Having the technology to read students emotional expressions can be helpful, but it determines how you use it and how you correct the results are. But having this technology isnt a bad thing. Its a way to determine what people are thinking without asking the person or being in that persons head. But with having technology that is able to read students faces and emotional expressions can be used and if used carefuly can help schools and other people today.
