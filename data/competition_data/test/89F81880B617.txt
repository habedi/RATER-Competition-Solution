Phones And Driving

Phones and driving do not even go together no matter how the argument about it is put. There are a lot of reasons you should not be driving while you are on your phone. It's all about your safety and others as well. Cell phones have been popular ever since they came out with touch screens to be honest. I think you should not use cell phones while you are driving because you may be the cause of an accident or more likely you'll be in one yourself.

One reason you should not use a cell phone while driving is because now a days you could get in trouble by the police. You are not suppose to be on the phone while driving anyway. You have to pay attention to where you are going. People die and come into this world about every second. If you continue to use your phone while you are driving then you'll get taken by one of those seconds.

Another reason you should not use your cell phone while driving is because what if you have people or kids in the car with you? You always have to think about safety first. Driving without a seatbelt is not safe either, it's also just like driving with your phone in your hand. Nothing is hard about putting your phone up while you drive at all. I would not want anybody to lose their life over that no way, not even on my worst enemy.

In Conclusion, I don't think your phone should be in your sight while driving. Because if you do it one time it's going to become a habit 9 times out of 10. You really have to start paying attention to the road. Really in my opinion everybody has to be safe and STAY safe while driving.
