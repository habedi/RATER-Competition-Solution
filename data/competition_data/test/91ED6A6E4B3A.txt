Dear Principal ,

I agree too policy 2. I don't think the kids should bring cell phones to school because if it vibrates while in class they might get too distracted , then they might pull out there cell phones and try to sneak them while the teacher is teaching. I honestly don't think kids should be aloud to bring any electronics too school.

Kids today are way different then back in time. They didn't have phones back then. So now the years have passed and all kids want to do is use there cell phones. They don't focus on school , they worry about the internet and drama and texting or on the phone. That's why the population of smart kids are going down. They make it seem like school doesn't even exist.

School is more important than talking on the phone. So yes i agree too policy 2 because, that's the problem now with kids. Well , if they bring there phones too school they have too make sure there on silence because most kids put them on vibrate. It might vibrate too loud.

Some kids are starting to make bad decisions , the only reason some kids have phones is because in case something happens. But you don't need your phone at school because , the school should already have your parents number if something was too happen .

Too me personally i think they should just stop bringing there phones to school. There's not a reason too bring it , that's what i don't get ! why bring it too school ? If i take my phone too school my phone stays on silence and in my locker , not in my pocket or anywhere else.

Parents just let there kids do any and everything. They should start being more protective. Because one day the kids are going to do what they want and not ever listen to what there saying. They will notice when there child starts too fail , they will realize taking there phone to school shouldn't be called for that's pretty much it, there parents will know letting them bring their cell phones too school is a bad idea.
