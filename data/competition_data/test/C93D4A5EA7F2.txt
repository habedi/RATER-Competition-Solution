Dear principal,

I think policy 1 would be a better choice. Allowing students to use there phones during lunch time and free time seems like a good idea to me.

First of all, letting kids have there phones during lunch hour and free time is a good idea because then they can do there texting and all that stuff during lunch time instead of class. For example, us teens need our phone to communicate, if you let us use it during lunch time then we will actually pay attention to the lesson that is given in our class because we will know that we have our lunch time to use it.

Another, reason i think policy 1 fits us rite is because kids wont be getting in much trouble getting caught with the phone in hallways, in class etc. many kids will get detention after school time or a talk with the principal for having it out when not needed. also having it in class and it rings disrupts the lesson and also disrupts the kids learning it witch makes the teacher take the phone away and getting in trouble. Having the privilege to have it out in free time and lunch will make the students not want to take it out because we would know that there is lunch for that.

As you can see, this is why i think policy 1 fits our school perfectly. It gets us student out of trouble and it also lets the students learn there lesson that was taught in class instead of having a conversation on the phone. or having it out.
