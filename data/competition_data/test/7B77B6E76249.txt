Dear Principal,

Students are going to always text and call each other; they can't get enough of their little, beeping, mechanical devises. Banning them is just going to make students find other ways to use their phones. This is why I propose to allowing phones to be allowed during lunch and free times, not during class. It would be more efficient in getting kids out of trouble, having them focus more in class, and less phones being taken.

Getting in trouble is a kid's worst nightmare, whether it looks like it or not. Cell phone abuse can be a bad problem-maker for kids, unfortunately. If we let kids mess around with those gadgets at that time, it might make them not want to use them as much during classes. Who knows, maybe we might get lucky and they wont get into trouble at all anymore.

If the student gets out the urge to text earlier, then they would have no problem focusing in class. They learn more listening to the teacher then by finding out how boring it is in their best friends class is. One of my teachers has had this problem before, so she actually sent the students a text, telling them to focus! how she got their phone numbers is beyond me. Maybe we should also let teachers text in class as well!

I have had my phone taken during lunch when I needed help on something and my friend was there to help me. but instead of getting my problems solved, it got my phone taken away. If we allowed students to use lunch as an opportunity to use phones not just to text but for important stuff such as homework, then the school wouldn't have to worry about the overdose of Blackberry's. Parents also get mad when they find out their child's favorite toy is taken away not only at the child, but at the school itself. Now there's a way to help ease up their mind.

If we allow students to use cell phones during lunch and other free times, the children will continue to learn but without a distraction and their finger-tips. Isn't that a policy we can all agree on?

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
