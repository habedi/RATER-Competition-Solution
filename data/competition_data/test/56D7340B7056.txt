dear principal,

It has come to my attention that you are contemplating whether or not to remove sports or other activities from the school unless students maintain a B or higher in classes. There are many reasons as to why you shouldn't do this. Some of which include social involvement, it is a good source of physical activity, and lastly because not all students are above average for meeting grades higher than C.

One of the most important reasons on why removing sports form the students that don't make B' s or higher is because it is a good source of physical activity. As you have probably heard childhood obesity has become a major issue in the United States and removing more time away from children to play and exercise would cause them to gain more weight.

Another important reason why you shouldn't remove sports from those who don't make B' s or higher is because it a good way to socialize with his or her peers. being on the football team gives me many chances that others may not have. I have always gotten good grades in all my classes with an occasional C but there is no need to take away my social involvement with my friends over it. Almost any and every job there is requires social skills that i will need to succeed in life and where else to get it than in sports?

The final and last reason on why you should have sports be available to those who make C' s is because C is the average grade. teachers always tell you to make B' s or A' s but that's only because they want you to exceed. They want to see that you can make grades higher than the average student and be successful. If a student is challenged academically in school and pushes barely to pass there is no need to have him exceed.

In conclusion there are three major reasons on why eliminating sports for those students who do not make B' s or higher should still be able to participate in sports and other activities. Those are the three reasons i can think of that would have the biggest negative impact on your decision. Thank you for listening to me and i hope you have taken my ideas and what i have said here in consideration.

Sincerely
