Did you know their are some principals that make decisions that truly benefit the students in the long run. I agree with the principals decision to make all students participate in a extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities, not only help with really important life skills, they provide an opportunity to make new friends and it helps students with their collage and job applications.

Extracurricular activities help people learn important life skills and lessons. Their are some skills that can only be obtained by practicing and joining extracurricular activities. Skills like, public speaking, typing, writing and being organized are skills that people pick up from a lot of practice and extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities dose not only teach skills it teaches lessons. leaning lessons at an age where it is possible to understand what is being taught, helps those lessons be at the top of their head where it will never be forgotten. All the lessons and skills the people learn stick with them throughout their life time. When I was enrolled into an extracurricular activity by my parents, I learned the skill of how to keep thing neat an organized, and that skill has kept with me ever since. That skill of being neat and organized helps me with finding work for my next class and keeping my locker very usable. Because of the skills and lessons I have learned from extracurricular activities, I agree with the principals decision.

Extracurricular activities also provide an opportunity to make new friends and strengthen existing friendships.

The first time someone attends an extracurricular activity, they are usually bombarded with friendly faces everywhere they look. All of the people that show up to the class are bound to have a social interaction with someone they see. Their are certain extracurricular activities were everyone needs to talk with their peers. Activities like debate and soccer are examples were everyone needs to communicate to each other to ensure that they know what to do and what is happening. Extracurricular activities force people to spend time with each other. When I was enrolled for an extracurricular activity, all we did was work with each other on activities and working with other people enhanced my existing friendships and helped build new friendships. Extracurricular activities have impacted me in a way where without them I would not have meet some of my really good friends, and that is why I think all students should take at least one extracurricular activity.

Extracurricular activities help with collage and job applications. Extracurricular activities show people the amount of experience someone has. When someone is reviewing an application for a doctoring job for example, they look at how much experience the person has had in the field or on call. The extracurricular activity someone is in, not only helps with showing their experience, it gives that person a taste of what their applying too and it can boost their confidence. Those activities you participate in can also, instead of boosting their confidence, tell them that they might not actually like that activity and pursue a different one. I had always been interested in coding and couple of weeks after I had began I realized that coding was not for me and that I really enjoyed playing sports.

The extracurricular activities not only show your experience they also how your determination toward something.

When someone signs up for extracurricular activity they are also sighing up for a course where they have to take out their own time and money for it which overall shows determination towards that activity. The amount of help the extracurricular activities give people is tremendous compared to just learning by yourself and that is my thought process on why every student should be enrolled in to any sort of extracurricular activities.

The principal made a really good decision to make all of the students participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Extracurricular activities help people obtain certain skills and lessons that can only be provided from extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities also provides a platform to make new friend and enhance existing friendships. All extracurricular activities help show perseverance, determination and experience.

All factors like learning skills, making friends, and having experience, are reasons why I think the principal made a good decision. In the long run all of the students that took extracurricular activities because of the principle would be benefiting.
