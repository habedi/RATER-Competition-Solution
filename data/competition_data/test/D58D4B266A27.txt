"Unmasking the Face on Mars"

there's alot of confusion or argument over the face being an alien artifact or landform. The face on mars is indeed a landform.

First, NASA, who discovered the landform, releaed the picture with the caption "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head. The authors thought it was an great way to bring attention to mars. Therfore contributing to the cofusion of the landform. Then, Micheal Malin and his team captured a photograph of the landform ten times better than the original authoers. ThIs photo revealed proof the face was a landform. Not everyone was saticfied so he set out for another photo. Finally, in 2001, Malin captured a photo using maximum resolution and each pixel neing 1.56 meters making the image three times bigger. The photo shows what looks to be a natural landform. this landform would be compared to Earths and Snake River Plain of Idaho.

In finding out the face was a landform , some conspiracy therist still believe the face is alien artifact. Onthe other hand defenders wish there was acually ancient alien civilization on Mars.
