Dear TEACHER_NAME,

First Policy

I believe that the first policy for the cell phones is more appropriate for the school.

It is probably more appropriate because if we had a school fire and our parents would have to pick us up, and no one had a phone, we couldn't be able to go home because they wouldn't know what happened or what was going on.

I also, think it isn't appropriate because sometimes when student's are texting in class it is rude for the students who actually want to learn. But it is also, fair because lunch is usually a free period and you should be able to listen to music and text or use your phones unless one of your friends your texting is in class.

Second Policy

The second policy is not appropriate at all because students should be able to bring their phones just in case of an emergency.

Say they aren't aloud to bring their phone and the electricity goes out in the school, and a student has a nervous break down and he has to go home. Who is going to know? Because he wasn't aloud to bring his phone. Nobody would and he would have to be rushed down to the hospital or something.

The second policy is also some what appropriate, it is appropriate because students text during school all the time and I personally think it is really rude and inappropriate.

Don't you?

Students text during school all the time and if the text they don't pay attention.

When they don't pay attention they don't get the grades they are supposed to get.

If they get bad grades the parents complain asking why their child got a bad grade and you tell them " Well because he text messages his friends during class and doesn't pay any attention!"

Well I hope I gave you something to think about over the weekend well i got to go.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME,
