Dear Principle,

I know that this may be a hard decision to make, but i will support you, and your choices. So to try to help you

I have some alternatives to consider. Like what if we gave them to our teachers during class time, or if we keep them in our backpacks. Also i will help you get a student's point of view, and I will provide the negatives and the positive aspects of being able to bring our cell phones to school.

Now, while I know many students want the positive aspects said,

I feel the need to list the consequences and distractions it may provide.

Say if you have your cell phone in class, and you have a big history test coming up you aren't sure if you studied enough for. The teacher gives you a bonus , you have extra study time. But wait you just got a text from that super cute guy/girl you've been crushing on, what do you think the average teen is going to do? Well I consider myself the average teen, I have a cell phone, and I know what I'm going to do. I would open up that cell phone behind my book and start texting. After all, it's just one little history test right?

Wrong! This test will impact your grade and life way more than that one time you text that guy/girl. So what, you can text them after the test they wont be mad if you explain the situation. So i agree with the first policy as long as the teacher has made sure that they are off during class time it won't be as serious a problem. If a kid doesn't listen, restrict the privilege of that person bringing cell phones to school for awhile. Trust me it will make a difference.

Now for a benefit, what if we have a sports program after school or a family issue. We may call our parents during our free time and sort things out. I know from experiences that my mom finds it hard to get a message to me, but i know that if it is a immediate and serious issue the school will feel its right to tell me.

Another fact is what if my grandmother is sick and my mom can't reach me? It may not be as serious as death or such but i would still want to know, wouldn't you?

These are just a few advantages and disadvantages to consider. While i know this is a tough issue, i hope you will take time to consider my opinion, and viewpoint. I am willing to bet that most teenage kids, who have cell phones, would want to bring them to school.

Another thing I am willing to bet on is the fact that most teachers would not appreciate kid's phones going off in the middle of class, because they have forgotten to turn them, off. So now that i have given you a hopefully unbiased point of view I will give you time to ponder my words and thoughts.
