There are only four years of highschool ,why waste it by staying at home? Being a student can be very difficult, and everyone learns and process things in differnt ways but online classes will not help students. This will only limit the students learning experiance, in fact it will probably make the student less motivated to focus in school. There are so many things that being in school provides that staying at home doesent. Some people may disagree and say learning from home can help the student be more comfortable with learning,but how can an indiviual improve themselves if they are too comfortable? students will be distracted by other things such as family or outside of school responsibilities.

Being in highschool is a once in a life time oppertunity. There are many things students can learn and experiance just by going to school. People develop many great relationships and create special bonds while in school. the programs and differnt activities such as clubs or sports, will help develop social skills for introverted students. People will not have access to this wonderful experiance if they are stuck behind a computer screen.

For a person to improve themselves they will have to get out of their comfort zone. if an introverted student is comfortable at home, and not experianceing what its like being around people, they will most likely struggle to communicate in the outside world. it is imoportant to grow and experiance new things, beacuase if a person makes mistakes experianceing new things, they can learn from it. Online classes will not help improve the students comunication skills beacuse it isnt verbal communicatuion. Theres a huge defference between video conferncing and conferencing face to face.

Staying motivated for school can be very difficult. That is why it is important for students to be surroundded by people who are also motivated. if a person is doing online classes they will not be able to see other students motivated in school. staying at home while trying to study can be extrimaly difficult. Family can be very distracting expeically if that student has siblings, that is why being at school is better,the student is away from these types of distracrtion while in school.

In conclusion, online school will not will not help students benifit in academics. the reason so is beacuse students will not develop communication skills. They will feel less motivated if they are at home. They wont be able to create amazing bonds and wonderful friendships, and they miss out on all the oppertunity being in school provides. Their are so many ways a student can learn, online school will only limit the student to their full potential.
