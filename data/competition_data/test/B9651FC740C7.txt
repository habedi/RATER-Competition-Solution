Dear SCHOOL_NAME principal:

America is a country of freedom. It has always been so, and I pray that it will continue in this regard. Your recent policy suggestion, however, goes against this patriotic principle. Although this would encourage student growth in the educational areas, it near annihilates their skills in the athletic aspects. Furthermore, this type of pressure might actually harm the students more than it helps them. Just as the lack of light will cause darkness, the lack of choice will lead to freedom's demise.

Throughout the books of history, America's part in the pages have been writ with the ink of independence. Though this decision of your is hardly something to write home about, it does indeed go against the very ideals of the American person. In a time of such lack of faith, must you take away the only order these kids believe in? Can you really stand by as our grandest liberty is slaughtered 'fore our very eyes? Have some mercy on the poor souls, if for no other reason than because you still can.

Despite the fact that your plan would, if followed though with correctly, increase the educational values of these students, it would stunt the growth of their other skills. One who strives to become the best at something, no matter what this thing may be, should have the opportunity to do so. Are those not the very words that drove our marvelous ancestors to allow our future generations a better education? By going against that notion, you are going against the idea of education itself! The one reason you could possibly support this idea with is the grandest reason why you should not do so! Can you be so blind?

Perhaps you have come to ignore these reasons. Perhaps you are not considering this letter of any importance whatsoever. I do not blame you, for I myself could easily do the same. But let me ask of you this; why would you do such a thing. Truly, what compels you to do so? Your reasons, if they are to be justified, and only be back-up by the fact that you wish to help these students. Yes, I'm quite sure that will be your plead. But even such a noble cause is not noble if done through evil deeds. Putting this kind of stress on a student is hardly a matter you can just shrug off and say "Ah, no biggie, I'm sure it'll work itself out." This kind of pressure with hinder all attempts at teaching these kids useless, as they will not want to learn. And without this want, without this driving emotion in the back of their minds, urging them to succeed, they will have lost all hope to accomplish anything past pitiful mediocrity.

I do hope you actually took the time to read this, and will heed my words. Otherwise, the consequence is not something I would like to imagine on such a nice day as this.
