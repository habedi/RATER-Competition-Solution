Dear Principal,

I think students should have at least a B average in school to be eligible to participate in school sports. If you make this a rule then students would work harder in school and get better grades. This would improve their GPA. Having a higher GPA will open up more choices for the student. These choices may include going to college or University. Sometimes sports do have an effect on students' grades because they have practice and games in the afternoon and don't have enough time to do homework or study for a test. If you do change this school policy then kids would try to open up more options to try and have their homework in on time and get a high score on a test.

If students join a school sport or activity the reason is usually because they love or have a passion for that sport or activity. Maybe it expresses who they are or just gives them something to do. The point is that the students join by choice and its their responsibility to keep up the good grades. When the students find out about the new policy (if you change it) they will work really hard to get their grades up or, if they already have good grades, keep their grades up.

Now I know that some students are going to argue against this new policy. Things they might say are "Oh, I don't have enough time after practice to do my homework/ study for a test." or "Keeping a B average isn't that easy to do." Well it isn't easy. And to solve this problem the kid might consider getting a tutor to help them out in school. When they don't have enough time they can come in before school to get their homework done or re-do a test that they failed.

Do you remember when you where a student in Middle school or maybe High School? Do you wish you had done better in school so you could have done better in college or University? This kids still have the chance to do that so you should help them out.

so you should change the school policy to a B average to joi
