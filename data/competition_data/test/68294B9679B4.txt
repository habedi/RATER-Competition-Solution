Have you ever thought it was a good idea to have driverless cars in the world? I think there are positive and negative things about this; but I agree more on the positive side of things. How would you feel to relax while you're on the road? How would you feel if it was finally legal to be on your phone while you're in the drivers' seat of the car?

I think it is a brillant idea of having driverless cars. Like i said you could relax while on the road. You could be on the phone while in the car. I also think this would be a great idea for people whos job is to make deliveries, such as UPS and FedEx drivers. This also would be a great idea for people who travel a lot and people who travel far distances.

I think more states and car companies should be more open about this idea. They should be open to this idea because all the good things that can come out of it, especially an idea that already has a prototype. More states should allow Google to test their driverless cars. Also lawmakers have to be open about this idea because this could possibly be our future.

Other companies such as BMW, Nissan, Tesla, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz should team up or have a meeting, and create the first ever street legal driverless car. All of those companies have great cars. Also all of those companies have something unique about their cars. So if they all work together, I know they could create a safe driverless car. Then, if they prove to lawmakers that driverless cars could go "half a million miles without crashing" maybe lawmakers might make it legal; and maybe more states would be open to having them.

So what do you think about the safety of driverless cars? Do you think driverless cars are too risky or dangerous? Do you think that lawmakers need to make driverless cars legal? Do you think those certain states are over thinking what could be the future? I think driverless cars would be a great idea. Hopefully in the future we could come to an agreement about driverless cars.
