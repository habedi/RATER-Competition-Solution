Should summer projects be teacher or student designed? Students should have full access to make their own summer packets. Who else knows what kids struggle with in school than the students their selves. They should have the right to make their own summer packet because they will make it fun for them, they know what they need help in the most, and it will be much easier on the teachers.

Firstly, letting students be in charge of making their summer packets will be the best thing ever. Students will loose interest in a summer packet if its just work page after page. For example, I once had a teacher that was very boring, her name was Generic_Name. Kids will do everything in their power to get out of her class, but they always failed to do so. Generic_Name would make the thickest packets ever, filled with reading passages that didn't have questions. When you returned to school after the summer, she'll give you a big exam on them. Of course students always failed because they didn't want to read them.

If a student was put in charge, they will add fun and creative things in the packet, which would keep the students attention. This way the students would keep their eyes on the packet to complete it.

Secondly, most of the time teachers often tend to put what they want to put in a packet, rather than what the students need. Putting students in charge will be perfect because they know their strengths and weaknesses. Lets say a student is struggling in Scientific Notation, giving a student packets on fractions and multiplication isn't going to help them on what they really need help on. Students sometimes feel overwhelmed when teachers put a lot of work on them. Students being in charge of making their summer packets will be more calm and stable.

Thirdly, giving students the honor of conducting their own summer packets will be more time consuming. Teachers always complain on how they never have time to do certain things. This will be time to take a break and have less to worry about. Most of the time teachers will give you work on a lot of materials you have already mastered and none of what you are struggling on. Giving students authority over summer packets will be likeÂ giving Kobe Bryant a basketball. It will bw a easy score. Students know their working limits, for they can only work so much before loosing focus on a certain subject.

Many people will disagree with this idea because they think kids are immature and can't handle it. Teachers love to be in control over everything. However thats not the case, many kids are very bright and intelligent. I've seen kids handle way more than the average teacher and it's quite eye catching. Students know what they need and how to catch their attention.

In Conclusion, students should be allowed to design their own summer packet. In fact, they chances of them completing something the are interested in are extremely high. Students should have full access to make their own summer packet because they will make it fun for them, they know what they need help in the most, and it will be much easier on the teachers.
