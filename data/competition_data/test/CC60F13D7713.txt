I as a highschool student disagree with the idea of putting emotional facial recignition in school. Us as a society already have lost a grip on society when it comes to technology. Our youth can't even have a true conversation face to face and struggle expressing emotion or creativity due to technology growth. I think we should have less technology and teach or youth how to ask when they want something, if there bored or confused then they should express that on there own not have a machine do it for them. We should teach our youth the confidence in being able to express feelings not make it easier for our social to be wiped away with this facial recigniton. We already rely on our basic tecnology such as cellphones, and computers to get homework done, cheat, solve the most basic math equations, and as I expressed before take away our ability to be social with our peers. With this facial recignition it will most likely be avaible to most people so in that will might lose almost all social activity in the future if we keep relying on technology to do it all. Instead lets make your be proud and confident in say they don't understand, lets make them understand that theres more then a screen, more then what we type and to see what is around us. This is what i feel is best for our youth. A life without any smart technology at all.
