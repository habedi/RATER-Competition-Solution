I dont think the facial action coding sytem is worth all the trouble of designing. It can supposibly detect emotional expressions from facial recognition. But what if that person really isnt that emotion? Many people can just fake being happy by smiling or they can act like their sad just by putting on a fake face. You can only truely know how they are really feeling by the way they act, or if you know this person very well. Why let a computer tell you that your sibling or somebody is actually moderatlely happy when they may be really depressed but doesnt want to show it. Instead of the computer scanning faces, why not have something that takes time to observe the way people act and feel. Theres no guarantee that Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy. What if she was just smiling for the painting? Theres no way a computer can solve peoples emotions like that. It would take way more work and progress to accuratly see how a person feels. And until something of the sort is designed, we should stick to the people who help with the people having problems with emotions and can tell whats wrong with them, like therapists or in some cases doctors. Anyone can just say theyre happy, and all they have to do is smile. Thats all it takes to fool an expensive computer thats honestly worthless. I think this is a human problem that technology cant really help out with that much. Emotions are a human problem that needs to be dealt and helped with human to human, not human to machine.
