I'm headed to my first soccer practice, with no experience. The butterflies in my stomach start to rumble as I exit the car, due to the fact that I have never participated in any kind of sport. The coach lines everyone up to shoot the first shot of his or her season. I shoot... I score! Guess my opinion was wrong about activities. Ever since my new principle was hired at school, lots of changes were made. The most well being rule was that extracurricular activities were now required. When the students heard about the new action made, the school went wild. However, I support the principle's new idea. Whether it's sports or clubs, in my opinion, requiring at least one activity can provide the opportunity to try new academics, benefit college applications, and boost social status.

Furthermore, extracurricular activities provide an opportunity to try something new. Due to technology, a lot of kids have become lazy over the years. Even doing the slightest favor can seem hard, like washing the dishes. Now a day children need to be active more than ever. It all starts from trying something new, like a sport or club. For instance, many kids fear the lack of talent in activities, however, trying new professions may just reveal a secret inner talent. When an adolescent is required to participate in an activity, he or she cannot refuse. In addition, the requirement may motivate kids to try harder in their specific activity. Not only motivation, but individuals can discover new interests from performing multiple professions. For example, after children try multiple activities, they can analyze which one was the most appealing to them. In the aftermath, extracurricular activities would defiantly provide the opportunity to try new ideas.

More seriously, participating in many activities can benefit college applications. When it comes to college, many people seem to think about grades. For example, many parents believe that if their kid has perfect grades then they are assured a spot at Generic_School. However, that is not really the case. Colleges mainly look for active, involved, and hard working students. For instance, participating in sports, clubs, after school activities, and community service may get a student recognized more than others. It is all about being unique and standing out the most. For instance, receiving rewards from a category is very crucial, because on college applications, rewards can be expressed to get noticed. To end with, when kids don't have an interest or activity to participate in, it could affect them negatively, or positively in the future.

Finally, activities can provide certain individuals with social opportunity. Many children lack friends, especially anti-social kids. However, participating in activities that someone else relates to, may help start conversations. In addition, close friend groups can be formed. For example, joining a school sports team would provide the opportunity to hang out with the team, and when you are on a team, everybody treats each other like family. Close bonds are made whenever people can relate to each other. Instead of making online friends through virtual reality, kids should be making real, close friends. The kind of friends that can count on each other in the future. However, not all friends benefit an individual. For instance, if somebody is influencing others in a poor manner, those are the kind of people to stay away from. Kids should always be aware of who they talk to.

In conclusion, some people may disagree or agree with the fact of extracurricular activities. However, in my perspective, I believe that extra curricular activities are important. By not participating, people really miss out on new opportunities, futures, and friendships. Unless someone is unable to commit due to time, money, or health, kids should defiantly be required to be involved in the extracurricular activities.
