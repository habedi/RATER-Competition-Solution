Phones are equipped by everyone in today's society. Whether you are poor or rich or even in between, getting a phone seems to be the easiest thing to get your hands on. Humans use phones to keep in contact originally but now it's used for entertainment, and nowadays you can make a lot of money off of your cellular device. However people tend to use phones more often than they should now since there have been more social apps, texting etc. equipped on devices. One big issue in the overuse of phones is using them while operating a vehicle. This particularly is a big issue because people have gotten hit, and many accidents have been the result of using phones while in the car. Each year over 421,000 accidents happen every year due to texting and driving or the driver was distracted by something else on their phone as well. Driving while using your phone can be very detrimental to your life and someone else's.

Driving is risky every time you do it, there are a lot of bad drivers out there just as much as there are good drivers out there so it is always important to be focused while you're on the road. Using a phone can be dangerous firstly because you can harm yourself or someone else as a result of not being aware while you're driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2017 there were 34,439 crashes and 9% of the crashes involved a distracted driver and 486 fatalities were as a result of these crashes with a cell phone in use. Also reports from the National Safety Council also say that if you are on your phone while you're driving then you are 6 times more likely to get into an accident then a drunk driver. These situations can affect both you and somebody else if you hit another car or just somebody crossing the street.

Nobody wants to go to court or be present in a court of law, especially for something like being on your phone while driving. Being on your phone while driving is a moving traffic violation and may go down as a criminal misdemeanor. Also depending on what state you're in you can pay fines for being on your phone while driving. For example in Georgia you pay $150 for being on your phone while driving but in other states such as California with the smallest fee you'd have to pay with only $20, however in Alaska with the highest fee you'd have to pay up to $10,000 and you'd have to do a year in prison as well. This can also go on your record if the state you live in has phone use while driving as a Moving traffic Violation. For this to be the repercussions of using your phone while driving, I'm telling you it's not worth it.

Finally Texting and Driving can also lead you to Prison. In the previous paragraphs I spoke on the fines and fatality statistics. In Alaska you can pay an additional $10,000 with a year in prison included and there were 486 fatalities in 2017 alone. Whether your texting or on social media while driving these distractions can end up hurting someone else more then you and this can lead you to the penitentiary even if it was an accident. In 2015 nearly 4,000 deaths occured due to distracted drivers another 3,450 were in the year 2016. This is a serious crime and people who have hit and killed people because they were distracted drivers can face up to 20 years in prison due to casualties from them being distracted. To play it safe the phone shouldn't be used while driving so no one gets hurt.

In Conclusion, being on your phone while driving is very dangerous for both you and people around you. This can be very detrimental to your record and you could be charged huge fines depending on where you live, you're not going to see many people in Alaska doing this. These accidents and casualties are preventable if drivers have the self control to only use their phones when there not driving their car. However maybe another way to fix it is if everyone had to pay the $10,000 like in Alaska, that may seem like a lot but someone loosing their life is worth way more.
