Life on a boat sounds terrifying doesn't it? Well you're wrong .You can do alot of things on a boat. Just ask Luke Bomberger. This man lived on a boat raising cattle.

Luke joined the seagoing cowboys after he graduated highschool. While Luke was on the ship his job was to clean up the spaces which had the animals in it. Sometimes his job was to check the animals every hour. Luke says that "it was the opportunity to see or do different things. Besides helping people."

when the ship arrived at different places Luke would explore the areas and go try different things. For example, he went on a gondola ride in Venice. Another example is he toured in a excavated castlein crete. My final example is that Luke marveled at the Panama canal. Luke also saw Acropolis and China.

Luke also found time to have laughs on the ship. The crew members and Luke after cleaning the hold would do sports. Such as, baseball and volleyball games. The would also do table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading , writing, and whittling. They also did boardgames.

After you did about 9 and below of trips. You see the world. It can also show you that other people in different countries need your help. Whether it's clean clothes,food,or shelter there is always a way you can help. These reasons show that living on a boat isn't so bad.
