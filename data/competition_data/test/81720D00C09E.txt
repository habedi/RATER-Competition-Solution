Dear Principal,

Students should volunteer for community service because our environment is becoming very trashy and disgusting. I believe that all students living in our community should take the time to pick up trash around our schools, houses, and community playgrounds. We want our neighbors to feel comfortable living in our community. Also when younger kids go to play at our community parks, we want them to be safe and having fun in a clean park. Instead of walking all over potato chip bags, candy wrappers, broken glass bottles, or even doggy business. Or when people are walking their dog they wouldn't want their dogs getting hurt by broken glass on the ground or stepping in another dogs business. So I suggest that students take a little time away from playing video games, using the internet, or watching T.V to come and just pick up a little trash around their neighborhood to keep it cleaner. It will make our community safer, cleaner, and better. It will also attract friendly neighbors to a clean community!
