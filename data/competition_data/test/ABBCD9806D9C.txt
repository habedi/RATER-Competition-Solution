Dear Mr. Principal,

My thinking is that not all students should do community service. Why i think this is because there are many reasons why students would not be able to do this. My thinking is that most of these students are involved in other activities. Another thing is that they might have other plans or be busy. There are many reasons why i think all students should not have to do Community Service.

One reason would be that some students have to get home and do things. For example, they might have chores to do right after school. Another thing would be that they might have to take care of their siblings. Maybe some students have a lot of homework to get done or a project to do. So this is why i think this.

Another thinking i have is that some of these students may be in other activities or clubs. Some students might be involved in sports or in many other activities. These students might not be able to quit these activities or clubs for Community Service. What I think is that we never know what these students might have to do or if their busy. This is why i think not all students should do Community Service. I hope you understand my thinking and thank you.
