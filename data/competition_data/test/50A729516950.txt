I think that kids don't need cell phones in school, they don't need them because they see there friends in class all day i don't think they need them at school.

Even if policy two was to go into affect kids would still bring cell phones into class and into the lunch room.

the majority of my class has a cell phone and 90 percent of them use there cell phones during school hours. The kids mainly use there cell phones to text not to call or talk to people. I think You are at school to learn not to converse with friends digitally.

If there would be a rule about cell phones at school they would have to be in your locker, and off, but the only time you would be able to use them would be to be on the bus, and before and after school.

But if that rule was instated the kids would still use them no matter what, the kids can just get away with that stuff all day.

like my friend will text and text all day and never get in trouble.

she just puts it under her desk and the teacher doesn't catch her in the act.

But there is some times that the teacher will hear it going off and she will tell them to give her the phone and she gives it back at the end of class, but if they have gotten caught with it before she will send it to the office and make the parents get it after school.

So i think that kids should just keep them in there lockers off and put away for good until they leave the premises of the school.
