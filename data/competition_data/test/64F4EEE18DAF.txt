For centuries, the idea of attending a classroom on time, everyday, consistently has been enforced globally. As of recently, the concept of online classes are being considered by school board, with several student participants. Attending classes online, or by video conferencing would overall benefit the student community, due to problems overlooked by having a mandatory attendance finally being taken into consideration. With online classes available, students with outside troubles ranging from a doctors appointment to disabilities, don't and won't have to be held back from their peers on supposed equal education. Lessons missed won't have to be left out due to an overlap in a student's schedule, which happens often because of the set time of school we have daily.

Code reds, hurricanes, pandemics or snow storms, are all examples of situations no one has control over. In such cases, we have no backup plan but to stay home. If a student misses class with a doctors note, information taught would have to be the student's responsibility. Emergencies, such as surgery with required bed rest, or a passing of a family member, are all examples of situations we as students have absolutely no control over. We witness multiple days off in a year, planned and unplanned, yet whenever we get them, the plan is to do absolutely nothing but stay home. With online classes available, students can plan accordingly which lessons and which classes they need to get caught up in, what is being missed, and their responsibility of getting material is made efficiently easier, with no excuse. Teachers won't have to rush, to get required material taught, causing a brief explanation or a result of unsure students, ultimately benefiting not only students but instructors as well.

Furthermore on the subject of situations where students hold no control, mental health is a topic that needs to be more addressed. Disabilities, such as hard of hearing or blind students, deserve a help up to be on the same level as anyone else, and it defnitely wouldn't be made easier trying to learn in a class room where everyone else has an advantage over you. Anxiety, triggered by overloads of work and places with an abundant amount of people or depression, where one can have little to no motivation, are two examples of how mental health is definitely overlooked, because although diagnosed in some people, it's still required to get out of your room, your bed, and continue dealing with what triggers those dark emotions. For some people, including me, or probably someone you know, or to a famous celebrity like Melanie Martinez, it doesn't sit right to be working in an environment, where half the time education really isn't a goal. In multiple interviews, she let's it be known to her followers that Melanie didn't have the best high school experience. If you dont have students looking back feeling accomplished with what they've done in their years in school, getting somewhere in life with the knowledge they've acquired by attending classes, what is the school accomplishing? Many students accomplish more learning in solitude, in their own peace and organization, where focus is at a peak and one can prosper in their grades, compared to sitting in a class.

Tapping a little into history, we come from a nation that once denied education to those who we believed shouldn't. Now, we allow anyone, and require everyone to have it. Having considered all these factors and more uncovered, why should we deny any more? We have everything required to give everyone the rightful knowledge they deserve. Over time, we all see and learn about how everything improves, how education or manufacturing or how technology changes. Allowing online class courses won't contradict that idea, as it's adding more efficiency, consideration and benefits to the school system. Just as we grow from carriages to flying cars, it's time to start adding a little advancements and play the smarter leverage.

Although many might not agree on just anyone taking online classes, shouldn't there at least be limited access? A form to sign, consoling with someone specialized in the matter, or at least a parent conference? Regardless of how many people, or how important it is for them to have access to online classes or video conferencing, it should be agreed that they would benefit all students in the long run, and in certain cases make snow days, sick days, and even difficult days a little more productive, and having them so available in this day with all the technology we have is beneficial to us all. School boards should consider and think of all the advantages and how it would outweigh any negative ones, and acknowledge the efficiency.
