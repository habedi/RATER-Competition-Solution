I beileve that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports the idea of studying Venus because the author says that Venus could have been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system and the curiosity researchers have to Venus, but thinking about the dangers and doubts that can occur. In paragraph 4 it says, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."

The author talks about how NASA has a idea for sending humans to go study Venus and has a possible solution to do that, but it will be risky. In paragraph 5 it says, "Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Vernusian landscape. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."

Another reason, the author talks about how NASA and researchers are working on other ways to study Venus, doing innovations to contribute the knowledge of Venus, and doing comparsions on how it will affect them or improve on while thinking of studying Venus. In paragraph 7 it says," Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditons. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."

In conclusion, the author explains some of the ways researchers think about when wanting to explore Venus. They also think about the consequences, but really thinking on how to overcome them. This is a challenge and also a valuable way to gain curiosity and information about Venus. In paragraph eight it says," Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation" This is why I believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents with the supporting details of the author.
