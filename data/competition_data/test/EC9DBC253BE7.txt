Phones & Driving

Cell phones and other portable devices are used and carried by almost everyone at almost every time. Technology has pushed us forward, but with us using it everywhere, we are using it in moving vehicles at over 35 miles per hour. Many people ever realize how dangerous it is to text and drive, however its just as dangerous to talk on the phone and drive, hands free tools don't help much either. No driver should use a cellphone mid drive for many reasons.

Cell phones are dangerous, texting to someone on a device while driving is more than dangerous. However it is also risky to Talk to someone on the phone while driving as well "1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone..."(CELL PHONE USE WHILE DRIVING STATISTICS). The chances of crashing while texting is just as high. Many people who text and drive are teenagers new to driving, and most likely not used to paying attention only on the road. Young people are early to most new technology, and on that technology is social media, a somewhat more elaborate set of texts. Most people may think, oh we can put it on a stand and let a screen reader read it to us and use voice to text cover texting, that is not how it works.

Many People try tools where they can place their phone on like a stand, or bluetooth device, these hands free tools don't always work. Talking to someone is one of the more distracting things a driver can do, "Talking on a hands-free celluar device ranked in the middle of the spectrum - more distracting than talking to a passenger..."(The evidence on hands-free cell phone devices while driving). Just taking is dangerous enough, however most passengers react to what you're driving towards and will stop. In most conversations with phone users, the person out of the car can not see what is ahead and have a continuously normal speech pattern, making it just as complex on the driver to take as ever. Many people consider this a safer option, despite the fact that there is overwhelming evidence of hands free devices being negative, it is not as spread out as texting and driving warnings. No one should talk on cellular devices and drive, but many people do, most who do are new to driving and just got their licence.

Most people who use cell phones and drive are younger, inexperienced drivers who just got their licence. Many times they are not used to multitasking, especially involving driving, 'Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.',(CELL PHONE USE WHILE DRIVING STATISTICS). When these teens hear their phone ring, they will naturally pick up their phone and answer it, they rarely know what trouble they are getting themselves into. Many teenagers are early to try out new social media websites, applications, or even new mobile devices, they are most of the time the first to use these once they are on the market, and they might be too drawn in by their technology to pay attention to driving. Most teens will learn engaged driving in time, but when they do not know what that is or are not doing it, they can doom themselves. A variety of people drive and use the phone, but a chunk of them are teenagers, but they will grow out of it if they are smart enough to.

Many people text and drive, but more people use the phone and drive, both are equally distracting to the driver but only one is ignored on the road. Some people know that using a cellular device and driving is bad, so they logically do not. However many teenagers use their cell phone and drive, and many people have tried hands free tools and devices. Cell phones never have worked well with driving, and only will when self driving cars are popularized.
