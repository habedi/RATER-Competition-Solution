After school ends, most children spend their summers relaxing with their friends and family. Not many of us do anything educational on the rare occasion that we may read a book. Because of this, some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue learning during their break. Students should be able to design their own projects because the project itself will be more enjoyable, easier to complete, and more beneficial to students in terms of knowledge.

Many of the projects that teachers assign during the school year are pretty boring. By designing their own summer project, students can have a fun experience with it. Not only that, but students will also be much more inclined to actually do the project. As an AP student, I have been assigned summer assignments for classes, which I ended up doing last minute. These assignments weren't hard, but they ended up being pretty long since we were given two months to complete them. Since I pushed them to the last minute, I was sitting in my house for hours for the last couple of days trying to get these projects done. Now, if I had found a project to do for the class, I would have completed it throughout the course of the break and would have had had a much better time completing it.

Something that we all know is that if you are actually interested in completing the task at hand, you will be much more efficient in completing it rather than a task you are not interested in. Because of this exact reason, students should be able to design their own project because it would be way easier to complete. Not only that, but students will actually feel like its their own task to complete, rather than some random assignment that is assigned by the teacher. Most students, including myself, complete homework for a class the night before its due. Many people think the ideal way of completing homework is to complete it the day it is assigned, but since, most of the time, students aren't really interested in the work, they end up cramming it to a later day. Although, if the student has a task from something that they are interseted in, such as the sport they play, then they will do that as soon as they can.

Another beneficial factor from being able to design your own summer project is that it is much more knowledgeable then a tradtional assignment. What I mean by more knowledgeable is how much knowledge the student actually gains from completing a specific assignment. A particular assignment may require research that allows students to gain a lot of knowldedge, but if the student is bored by the topic, then they will just try to finish the assignment by whatever means possible. They will not try to learn the topic, and will probably end up getting the answers online or from a friend. If we compare this to another scenerio where the assignment pertains less information, but actually interests the student, then the student will definetely walk away with much more knowledge than they did before. Because of this, students should be able to design their own summer projects.

Many people think that if students design their own summer projects, then they will just goof around and try to pick a very easy topic. This is arguable, as teachers can easily set boundaries for their students and have certain requirements such as having a minimum word count, page count, etc. All in all, students can have a good time and gain plently of knowledge if they are able to design their own summer project.Â
