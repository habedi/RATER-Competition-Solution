The Face on Mars. Many say that it was created by aliens, but I think diffrently. The Face on Mars was clearly just a miracle of nature. Over the many years that Mars has been here, it could of just be the wind and dirt forming over the rocky surface of Mars.

The Face is clearly just a huge rock formation on the surface of this planet. There is no logical reason that aliens would of made this Face. It wouldn't of been useful for a home, a shelter, or even just a explimation of life on the Red Plant. This Face represents a human face, but humans aren't capable of living in such conditions of Mars, so if it were aliens, wouldn't they created a face in the ground of a alien and not a human, have which they never seen.

With the new cameras we have today, if there where by any chance, homes, airplanes, or even pyramids on Mars, the cameras would be able to pick them out and NASA would have seen them. With saying this we can comfirmed that there is no showing of life on Mars, so the Face couldn't of been fromed by aliens.

The Face is clearly just a part of nature that was created and with our eyes we see a face. The rock formation that we see, looks like a face using the shadows from the sun, and the form of the rocky surface. With this face getting so popular, many of the conspiracy theorist are taking advantage in that and using their theroies of alien life and planting it in the minds of others. Using the Face in a movie, magazines, books, radio shows, and even in the grocery store checkout lines, the face has taken over our minds in beliving in the life of aliens.

Some people say that the Face on Mars is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, but I still believe that it's just a way of nature.
