People should participate in being a Seagoing Cowboy Program because they do not know what they would be missing. I have seen people who helped others like this and it chaned their life forever in a positive way for both of them.

Luke met tons of people,animals and even went new places like Europe,China, Greece, and Italy you would go to new places and you would be helping people who are in need every day too. Luke enjoyed helping people,and animals they even met people who you probly would not meet every day.

The trip changed Luke's life a lot because he probly would have never thought of hosting to a number of international students, and he even exchanged visitors every year he even met more and more people even after the trip you never know who you could meet.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboy program it would change your life forever a lot of people could have gone to Hawaii and said I saw sea horses, but not a lot of people could say I did the Seagoing Cowboy program and helped lots of people you would have fun make new friends and even new family there is somany reasons you be a Seagoing Cowboy and these are only a few. You would enjoy helping people every day.
