Dear principal,

Your decision for deciding whether all of us should do community service is up to you, but I wanted to tell you that I think it would be a magnificent idea if you had all of your students do community service, it would teach them to think about others before themselves. Not only would it let them see the respect they have for the community, it would lead them right into success, for when they get older, who is going to take their place? The kids below them, they will be setting a good example of how our world needs help and if we don't get that help soon, who knows what'll happen. So if you decide on not having students do community service, then think about our future, don't you think we can save the world a little at a time by having kids do a little community service for once? Well, I think so. So if you choose to have them do it, just think of all the good things we can look forward to in our future, all because someone, meaning you, decided to make a good choice for all people.

Thank you, sincerely:

One of your good students.
