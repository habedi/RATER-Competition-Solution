I am agree whit those school who offer classes online because they are many student who want to be better in the life. Same students don't have the opportunity to be better in the life. Same have to work others have kids and they miss the opportunity to study in a regular school.

They are many peoples who want to be better, student who want to graduate early from high school or the university. It is better for those peoples who work and want to study an the same time. it is good for those peoples who get sick and they can't go to a regular school.

For example my mom she came at this country and she din't get the opportunity to go to school, because she have to work, after a few mount she star getting classes online, now she have a better job and a better life. she fine the opportunity there and she take that opportunity.

I think that in this country are many ways you can be better. It is better do classes from online or video conferency for those peoples who want to be better in the life.
