Yes, I argree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should try something new . They can see what activitys they like to do , they can become friends with new people, and they can do more hands on activitys.

Students can see what activity they like to do. Some students never done an activity before. So they may want wanna try something now. They may wanna try a sport they never did before. Students may already have a activity they like to do and they wanna keep doing it. Some people have a hard time trying to find what they like do.

Students can become friends with other people. Some people don't have friends and they wanna make friends. Some students have friends and their friends are doing a different activity. Some students don't wanna feel left out so they make friends.

Students can do more hands on activitys. Some students do better when its hands on. They like to be able to touch it and see it . Some students would rather heard it and can remember it like that.

Students should participate in one extrarricular activity. They can see what things they like to do, they can become friends with other people, and they can do more hands on activitys. They will wanna do it again and have fun.
