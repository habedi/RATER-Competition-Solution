"Face" the Facts

The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the "truth" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the "Face on Mars" is nothing more than a natural landform.

First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," it says "...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.

Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.

Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" it says "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West." (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.

To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to

In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.
