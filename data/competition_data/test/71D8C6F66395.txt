Venus,sometimes called the "evening Star," is one of the brightes points of lights in the nigths sky,making it simple even for an amateur stargazer to spot. However,this nickame is misleading since Venus is a planet. Venus is simple to see from distant but safe vantage on point of Earth,it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

A strong point of the author that proves that Venus is a challenging place to explore is on the second paragraph "each pevious mission was unnamed,and for a good reason,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours,maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study,despite its proximity to us."

"A tick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far extremely that anything humans encounter on earth." This talks about the higher tempereatures of Venus,which makes it difficult for humans to explore it closely,scientis have tried with differents materials and different methods to see what wouold work out and resist the high temperatures of Venus.

In conclusion,Venus is not a hospitable place due to its high temperature weather,temperature contitions in Venus are far exttremely that anything humans encounter on Earth. Also,the clouds of high corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere makes it even more difficult for humans to live in there.
