Have you ever had loads of school work to complete and been so over stressed that you don't want to do anything anymore? Forcing a student to participate in an activity they are uninterested in can be a waste of time, it can be an overtaking of a student's freedom, cause students' health to worsen, and students may already have a busy schedule. I disagree with the principal's decision because pressuring students do an extra curricular activity can be a huge waste of time, it can cause unneeded amounts of stress, and students may not have the time to participate.

To begin with, it can be a huge waste of time to make participation in extra curricular activities mandatory. This is because students might not want to participate in an extra curricular activity, students might not find an extra curricular activity that they enjoy and want to participate in, and it might not be helping them in the future. Students might not want to participate in any extra curricular activity because they might not feel up to it, or they are doing fine right now and want to keep it that way. Students might not find an extra curricular activity they enjoy and want to join because they might want to do an extra curricular activity but the school might not offer the activities they enjoy, and even if the school had an option to create your own club, there would be too many clubs created and not enough people participating in them. Lastly, it might not be helping them in the future because the activity could just be a fun activity, and might not help them on their college resume, or help them get a job. Implementing this rule or policy would just waste student's time and just force them to stay at school for an extra one to two hours on top of the seven hours they attend school. This policy won't be helping them but instead wasting their precious time.

Another reason, participating in extra curricular activities can cause an unneeded amount of stress. This is because students might already have enough work from teachers and adding more work from extra curricular activities isn't needed, students could also be pressured with the extra work and might not want to do it to the best of their ability, and students' health will worsen. Students might already have loads of work from teachers and adding more work is just going to put so much on their agenda, and students won't be able to enjoy themselves. Students may also be pressured with the extra work and might not want to do it to the best of their ability which in some activities is an important factor because of competitive and team events. Students' health will also worsen because of how much stress they are dealing with, and some students might not have a method to cope with the stress, for example, students might have mood swings, develop gray hairs, and stop hanging out with friends. Students also might not get enough sleep finishing their work which can cause a lack of focus, and cause students' grades to fall. This proves that if this policy gets implemented then students could deteriorate their health and cause them to fail their core classes which would affect their future and will lower the school's statistics.

Finally, making students join extra curricular activities isn't practical because students might not have enough time to participate in the activities. This is due to how some students are already enrolled in a sports club, or another program, most students might not be able to stay one to two hours after school, and students need to do their homework on time. Lots of students are already enrolled in a sports club or another activity and making them stay after school could cause them to cancel their classes or screw up their schedule. Students also need to do their homework on time which is a big issue since some students don't do their work without any extra activities, now imagine what would happen to students' homework records if there were extra activities. This shows that if this rule existed then some students wouldn't attend the activities, some students would have to give up activities that they've been attending for years, and a ton of students would never complete their homework on time.

In conclusion, implementing a mandatory extra curricular activity policy will be a waste of time for students because it won't help them and just force them to be taking the activity, it will cause a huge amount of stress because you need to be doing work that isn't needed as well as homework, and students will not have enough time to participate. I urge you to think about how many students won't enjoy this program, and just want to participate in what they want. You will stress out students, and students who want to participate can participate in extra curricular activities, but it shouldn't be a mandatory program. If you force students to participate in extra curricular activities you hand students buckets of unneeded work, drown them in stress, and mess up their entire schedule.
