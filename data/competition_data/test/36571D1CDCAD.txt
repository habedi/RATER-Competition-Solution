Dear: principle

I think that we should have a grade B average at least because ,people that don't have a grade B average does not deserve to be in any sports activities .One reason is that students will take advantage in the activities and will tell other students that it doesn't matter if you have a grade average c or higher. Another reason is that students will try to make other students with a lower grade average will try to sneak into the sports activities and don't get caught in the sports activities. I think if you want the students with a grade B average or higher, you should stop them at the door and check their report card to see their grade averages and if they don't have a grade average of a B or higher they can not join with the other students in the sports activities that has a grade average of a B or higher.
