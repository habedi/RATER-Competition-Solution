I believe that the use of technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable. There are six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This emotions can be shown an identified due to your facial and bone structure when showing one of this emotions. For example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised. When you get angry your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show anger.

I believe that the use of technology to shows peoples emotions is valuable. This can be very helpful to profesors giving one hour lectures. This can show the profesor if the students are bored or confused. Meaning if the profesor is awared of one of this emotions they can help the student or make the lecture interesting. Doing either one of this things can change the students emotions durasticly. Another thing we can check up on, is if the student is engaged with the teachers teaching abilities. We would also be able to see if the students are angry at one another, happy, or maybe even disgusted. Identifying emotions can help the profesor, but it can also help out other students. If the students were able to tell what this emotions are, then school drama would decrease in a way. For example lets say a student was disgusted or angered at some student the person could easily ignore him or prevent making eye contact with him. Getting into a serious note lets talk about school shooters. If we were able to see how a angered lonely kid feels, we would help him and we could prevent them from making a tradjic mistake. This could prevent tradegies from happening around the world. Where a no hearted pathetic animal goes and shoots up a school.

So in my opinion I agree with using technology to show peoples emotions. Not only can this make class fun, but it can also help people that are headed to a path of distruction and hatred. This would be able to help a majority of people not just the ones I included.
