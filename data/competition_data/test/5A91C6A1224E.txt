I think policy 2 is better because many student would just brake the rule of keeping your phone turned off during class, so if their going to brake the rule might as well not let them use it during school. These days student are just always on their phone and they aren't trying hard enough in school, either because they are distracted to much, or they are just spending their time on their phone chatting with their friends. The principle should banned student from using phones during school is in session until the principle sees the students test scores are getting higher up. Not allowing student to use their phone during school is a great idea because now students are going to be more focused on school studies then just spending their time on their phone. Phones are a great invention but I think it would be better to keep them out of schools for the students education. Most parent's of students would probably agree with me. I consider phones distractions inside of a school campus. If I were to go to school and offer a student a phone, or an education the student would most likely choose the phone. My opinion is that the most important thing a student should get is a education, but if they cant get it because a phone is more important to them then i think that is just sad. Most people in the United States would consider a phone a distraction for the mind of a student.
