Dear principal,

I think it is a bad idea to make students have a b average or higher in order to participate in sports teams. many students don't make those kind of grades and not only would there be fewer students capable of making those kind of grades but there would also be less students that are eligible to make a sport team and therefore we would have a smaller team and we may also become inferior to other schools with sports, thus we lose to other teams do to a lack of team size(the way I see it if we go along with that idea not many students will be able to make the team and a team cant operate well when it only consists of few people and we would be outnumbered by the average sized sports team).many students will strive to be on a sports team but when you make them have an average grade of a b then some will give up and go home telling themselves that they are not capable of being put on the team and that they should forget about it and then they will have no motivation at all to do good anyhow. if you make students at least have a 2.0 GPA(which is the required GPA to be eligible to play and participate in sports and sporting events)then students will actually have motivation to do good and wont think that the required grades are impossible(where as if we were to make students have an average grade of a b many students would be discouraged and tell themselves that they are not capable of making that kind of grade and will just give up on making good grades whatsoever or even make a sports team for that matter)its good to make grade requirements to be eligible for a sports team but if you push the students to high with the average grade of a b then many students with their mentality will just give up and will think they aren't capable of making the right grades why I think that we should have an average grade of like a 2.5 to be eligible for sports

Sincerely,
