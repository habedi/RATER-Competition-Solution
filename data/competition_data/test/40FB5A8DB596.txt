Online learning should be an option for students mainly for seniors . Why i say this because seniors are the most busy in high school , they are all working hard in and out of school to earn money to go to college . And sometimes most students can't handle the pressure of their final year in high school because they have to balance out their personal life , school, also work at the same time . Another reason is that half of the students in high school work right after school and get out around 10;00pm or later depends where you are working , So students barely have time to do homework because they are getting out of work late . And right when they get home from work they go straight to their rooms and start doing their homework for class tomorrow . But if we had online classes it would be much easier for students and release a lot of stress because students won't have to worry so much about turning in their homework in on time . With the online classes there should a deadline where you have to turn in your homework on a certain date ,Therefore the students won't have to worry about it so much because they know the deadline when they have to turn in their homework and it gives the students more time to relax and take a little break from school.

Another reason why i think it's a good idea and i'm speaking from my experience for the three years that i've been in high school , it doesn't get any easier it gets harder and harder every year . junior and senior year are the most hardest years in high school ,right now I'm in 11th grade and i have like i have a lot of stress on me because teachers giving us test and quiz's back to back and we have two extra sol's that we have take this year. Which adds even more stress on us because i always think negative and always think the worse knowing that i could do really good on my test and sols or do really bad and fail every quiz and test that my teachers give me . Failing a grade or a class is a students biggest fear because they don't want to repeat that class or stay another year in school .This is why students always push themselves to the max and try the best they can to be the most success in high school and make their parents proud .

I always try my best in school i give it all i got , because i dont want to let my parents down and fail them . Next year will be my final year in high school and i have a full schedule for my senior year and i hate it because i wanted to be able to go to work early and make as much money as possible before i leave for college . That's why i wished school's would offer online classes because one you could finish the class in a couple months and get thr credit for the class .And second it will free your schedule and give you the chance to leave school early . Also if a student is missing a credit they don't have and they need it to graduate on time , the school should offer them that class that they take it online so they won't be missing any credits and graduate on time with their class .

Therefore i think online classes is a good idea for many reasons and i think school's should offer it to students and let them pick if they want to do online classes or attend their classes at school . And even if some students are missing any credits or failed a grade school's should give students the chance to make it up . No student wants to do five years in high school when they could finish in four , this is why i think online classes is a good idea because it will benefit a student who failed a class or even failed a grade a year before because with the online classes they could finish the classes they need and attend school at the same time just do the online classes out of school . I think online classes would benefit me a lot because i'm missing one or two credits right now and i would have to go to summer school to get those credits , But nobody wants to be at school in the summer time they rather be outside and having fun . So if my school offed me the chance to take online classes i would so i could graduate on time and with my class . so that my parents see me walk that stage and know that i made it and will do big plans after high school . Therefore yes i think online classes is a good idea and will benefit a lot of high school student's.
