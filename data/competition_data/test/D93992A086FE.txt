Cars have been around for awhile and they have had a major impact on society. Many people believe that there is no problem with the frequency of cars being driven. But, there are many advantages to less car use such as improving our cities and suburbs, improving safety, and decreasing pollution.

Many have tried to make cities a little more dense and better for walking but nothing has seemed to work; therefore, they have moved on to suburbs. Now, people are trying to make suburbs better for getting around while walking instead of driving. By doing so, places such as shops will be made closer and more convienent which allows people to be able to consider walking as a better option. By having these suburbs, and soon hopefully cities, reduce the amount of cars used, the people living in these areas will be able to accomplish more in a healthier and safer way.

Safety has been an issue in almost all areas due to a variety of reasons; one being cars. People pass by "Drive Safely" signs or memorials on the side of the road too often. Many accidents occur because of all the cars and traffic and careless driving. By reducing the amount of cars being driven, the moment of deaths in car accidents can be reduced as well. In "The End of Car Culture", author Elisabeth Rosenthal states, "Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends." Recently, teenagers who are able to get their license haven't really made it a priority. This could be caused by factors such as fear of driving or just because they've figured out a way around driving. Not everyone needs a car to get around; there are plenty of other ways to safely get from point A to point B.

Another large issue cars contribute to is pollution. Pollution is in every city, every state, every country, every continent. Cars are "a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..." (Rosenthal, Elisabeth, "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"). Cars don't help with environmental issues what-so-ever. They add to the smog issues and they increase the about of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In the capital of France, for example, congestion was down sixty percent due to smog causing delivery companies to lose money since they couldn't delieve what was needed. Cars are extremely harmful to the environment and they make the issues we already have even larger. By limiting car usage, people could hopefully work on repairing the damage we have already done to the environment instead of worsening it.

Cars have impacted society ever since they were made. By reducing the amount of cars driven, cities and suburbs can be improved, better safety can be implimented, and pollution will reduce. Until then, the issues cars create will continue to get worse and by the time people see it, the problems will be too late to fix.
