After I graduated from high school I made a life changing choice and that was to go to Europe with my friend and while I was in Europe I joined the "Seagoing Cowboys". And I want you to make that same choice. And I dont want you to just think that im asking you to join for no reason im asking you to join because the benifits are really good.

I also would want you to join because you can travel all around the world and help animals who need help. Wouldnt you want to travel around and help animals in need? And on top of that you meet new people and it may seem like work but it dosent feel like work at all its actually pretty fun.

If i were you i would join right now. The list of reasons go on and on but if I were to write them all down I would need to write a book. So instead of me writing a book why dont you just join and I promise you will love it. And if you dont you can always quit but I highly doubt that you wont love it. You can either take the information that im giving you and go for it or not even try at all. But the choice is yours to join the "Seagoing Cowboys". Please and thank you.
