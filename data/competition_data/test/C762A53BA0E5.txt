In 6th grade my parents forced me to sign up for student council. At first, I was upset and I was trying to convince them to change their mind. They didn't. The next week I had my first meeting and I loved it. My first meeting was the highlight of my week. I wish there were meetings every day, but sadly there werent'. The only reason I got involved in student council was because my principal made the decision to offer student council and many other extracurricular activities. Students should participate in at least 1 school activity.

One reason students should participate in school activities is so that they can make new friends. Dr. James Arnold once stated that "friends are like oxygen the more friends the better and you need friends to live just like you need oxygen to live." This shows that it is impossible to have to many friends. There is no negative effects to having too may friends. Participating in school activities is a great way to make new friends. Dr. John Washington said that "I once signed up for my school yearbook because I liked taking pictures, but I was a little worried because I didn't know anyone in the club. So I tried to make new friends. I met this kid named Alex and we became best friends till this day."

It is clear to say that joining school activities is a great way to make new friends.

Secondly, it is true that going a school activity can also help the community. A serve taken by John Hopkins University shows that an average of 4 trees are planted every year by each U.S. school. With all the global warning going around the world it is clear that every tree being planted by U.S. schools will help the earth and that is all because of school activities. Some schools have a greens program that helps clean the earth. Normally the program meets once a week and they go and plant a tree, pickup trash around the community, help garden, and sometimes they volunteer to help the less fortunate. Students should be proud that they are helping the community in such great ways. The school should recognize the program and help to get more people to join the program. Programs like these are great for the community and environment and should be in every school in the county, but that's not my choice.

Lastly, students work really hard during school and deserve to do something fun and school activities is the perfect way to reward them. A report done by Oregon University shows that 89% of kids feel like they work better after 10 minutes of getting some fresh air. Students can be getting that fresh air by doing school activities. School activities combine learning and life skills together. By letting students go outside they are getting fresh air so that they aren't stuck in a school building the whole day..

Some people might think that doing these school activities is a waist of time and kids should just be learning the whole time. Although, they are particularly true it is also true that in order for kids to get a good job they need to be a respectful person and most jobs and colleges require community service hours. By joining these school activities they prepare you for the future. Tobias Johnson is the president of the company smart bond. He once stated that "when I first started my company I only hired the people that have given back to the community and the people that seem like they have a kind hearts." This means that these school activities will benefit them in the future. By joining these programs you can also put them on your regime and that shows that you have helped the community or helped your school by doing the right thing. Company and colleges will look at that and think this person is a leader. All good companies have leaders guiding the companies and employers to do the right thing. If a company didnt have any leaders to guide their company the company would fall apart and argue a lot. In the end picture it shows that most of the students that take school activities end up most successful in the future.

Ultimately, it is clear that doing school activities will benefit the students a lot through the use of making friends, helping the community, and getting the kids some sun while in school. By adding school activities to every school in the U.S. we can change the future of our society. If we dont start now by trying to change our students then companies will fail. If companies fail their will be no competition for buying goods and everything will be overpriced. We need to act now. If you want to help call or send a email to your principal and try to persuade him to add student activities to your school system. If you already have school activities then be active in joining them and try and convince your classmates to try and join them. This is our future.
