Dear Principal,

Should students have over a B average on order to attend sports or any other activity? Students should have over or at least a B average in school. If you can do sports or any other activities then you are able to manage school work no matter what. Sports have a huge responsibilities. Student's grades must be over or at least a B average because you can maintain good grades, earn the privilege to attend a sport and be motivated to improve your grades even more.

First, Sports can help you be motivated in school work. A survey has been done in the school and 80% of the students said that sports do motivate them to improve their grades and achieve their goals. It has been stated that "Some students maintain good grades for their parents and themselves to be able to do sports and/or magnificent achievements in life. Sports can be a wonderful thing to do, but also have good grades. Your good grades and sports can help you achieve goal's and give you an opportunity to be successful in life.

Second, You need to be able to earn the privilege of doing sports. If a child is only paying attention in their sport and not school then its a enormous problem for the students future. The student can be retained for many years if they only focus on sports and not their school work. No matter what people say their is always a chance to study hard and work hard for school. School may not be a huge fan of kids but if they want a better life they have to earn privileges and learn to take responsibility.

Third, Maintaining good grades is the most important thing ever in school. You can receive a scholarship for your well academics and good achievements. My sister was a honoral student and she received a scholarship for her academics. Now, she has been doing so well in life that i wish i could reach to her goal and maybe even more. Having good grades can help you do better in life. That's why sports can also lead you to a good path.

In Conclusion, a student should be able to have at least B average to attend any sport. Sports can help you be motivated in school but its a huge responsibility. Also you need to be able to earn privileges in life otherwise you will never understand how hard is to receive something special. Maintaining good grades is a wonderful thing to tell anyone in the future and be proud of to say. Sports is like a big A on every test you are given in life.
