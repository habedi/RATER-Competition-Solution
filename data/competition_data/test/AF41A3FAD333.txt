Do you know what the Seagoing Cowboy program is? A Seagoing Sowboy is a program that ships cattle on a boat. Being the Seagoing Cowboy program can be great in many ways. Also we need more crue members to help out on deck. Here are more reasons why you should join, and learn more about me.

My name is Luke Bomberger. I work as a Seagoing Cowboys program and I am here to help the cattle be moved. I move the cattel for people who need it. When I say I move cattle for people I'm doing it because, It's for people who lost their homes in war, battle, and even earth quakes and herricains. Also more like tornatoes and athor tragic events that happen around you.

Its not all about the cattle being shipped, you can do fun things to. There are a lot of things to do on and off the ship. Also you help people get their lives back on track. Don't forget about the things you will see.

There are lots of reasons why you should help people. And with that you know how you can help out you nabers in case of an emergency. But naberes to me means, "the world."
