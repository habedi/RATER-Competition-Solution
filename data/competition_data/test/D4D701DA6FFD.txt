Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have recently heard that you were reconsidering cell phone usage during school hours. My thoughts on this were, you should let students use there cell phones at school during times not in class such as lunch,passing periods and the beginning of school. Alot say that it would not be a good thing to do because of other students stealing other students cell phones when out from his or her pockets or backpacks,but my opinion is that most students have cell phones these days and they wouldn't want somebody elses cell phone. My next thought is if we could use them during lunch,passing periods and the beginning of school before the first bell rings. During lunch we could use them to talk to family or other friends outside from the same school we are talking from. Now alot say it would be a distraction if we did use them during school hours but it woulden't be a distraction if we used them outside of class like my opinion here. My next idea was using them during the morning before the first bell rings so we would not be done with texting until our next free time or outside from class. Hopefully my thoughts and/or opinions well help make it easy on you.

Thank you for your consideration

Sincerely,STUDENT_NAME
