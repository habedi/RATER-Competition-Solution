Well, I do know that Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and that its a very challenging place to examine. I thought that Venus was one of the warmest/coldest planets in the galaxy, but it just so happens that its neither.

I know that Neptune is the most freezing planet. It's the type of planet that people don't want to examine or not even explore. Even though,Venus is really simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth for the ones that like to stargaze.

The article mainly talks about on how others would see the planet "Venus," I see the "Evening Star " as a the brighest of the planets of the whole entire galaxy along with the Sun(Itself).

To me, I also thought that the Sun was just another type of planet,but it wasn't. Turns out the Sun was the "Biggest Star of the Galaxy."

Let's not forget that Venus is often referred to as the Earth's "twin."

Because Venus is after all the closest to the Planet Earth. The author would probably describe as the 2nd planet on the right, but I would describe/define it as the planet with the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it very simple for the stargazers.
