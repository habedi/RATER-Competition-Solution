venus might sound like an interesting planet to discover but is it that important to risk it.

venus is a very interesting planet to learn and study about. It has many different things to look at like formation,consuistency,and even life perhaps. But besides that is it really safe for us to go there the risks that 97% of the atmosphere is carbon deoxide that means you would need a long lasting oxygen tank. The other problem is the tempature reaching up and maybe over 800 degrees Ferhinheight. that means if you had that oxygen tank it would melt so you have no oxygen and would die.

Other causes that can be unsafe is the amount of presure it is recorded that its 90 times more preture build up and you would be crushed to death if it could crush a subramine. There is errupting valcanin ash that would errupt and make you disinigrate instantly.

It ight be cool to learn about and discover new things but is it worth it? Why should we risk to go out and learn about a planet that is so deadly should we take the risk? I feel like its not wotrth to risk a life over a planet.

With all the discovery that can be disovered

The life of one is more inportant than to know about a planet. The thought of it should be revised and looked st again.
