You would think attending classes from home would be beneficial for a kid, and it could be, by having the freedom to learn at home and being in a place that is suitable for you. But learning from home has it's downsides. Many people believe that kids who attend class from home miss out on fun opportunities, things at home will distract the kid from learning, and kids who stay in school are more hands on than kids who learn from home. Why students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home is the fact that is too distracting and less hands on compared to going to school.

Me being a student myself, I would say having the choice of having distance learning is tempting, but I know it would not benefit me in a good way. When you are in an environment that you are comfortable in, you tend to become lazy, not as motivated, and you start to slack off when you constantly have work to do that you don't want to do. For example, I have an online course that I have to take to graduate high school which I take at home. Usually, I don't feel like doing it so I search the answers online to finish my work. Kids now have technology that could help them with the work they don't want to do or even distract them from doing their work.

Having someone physically present with you when you need help with a question you don't know is something a student who attends classes from home doesn't have the ability to get. Distance learning students attend class from home by video conferencing, which means everything they do is from a video chat with a teacher, but students who stay in school has a teacher to physically be with them to provide help and answer any questions they need. This shows that students who video chat with their teacher have a hard time showing the teacher their work they have done but students who go to school just has raise their hand and there would be on the way to see it.

Students who go to school get more experience then kids who attend classes from home. Some classes at school has certain equipment that costs a lot of money that not a lot of people can afford. How would you think a student from distance learning could get those things? they don't. The kids from distance learning don't experience those things at all, but kids who go to school get to experience, touch, and test out those things. Students who attend school from home miss out on opportunities they would get if they just attended school.

Students who go to school gets the reassurance they need from teachers, the hands on experience, and the ability to learn things without the unneeded distractions they have at home unlike students who attend class from home who experience the exact opposite. Why would you stay at home and have distractions interrupt your learning?

Students who attend classes from home would not benefit as much as kids who attend school.
