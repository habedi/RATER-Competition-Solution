What if you had no friends and all you did was school work? Well I think that extracurricular activities could help with that in many different ways. I Agree that all students should be in a extracurricular activity, weather it is a sport or something with the yearbook club. All students have something that at least like to do or are good at and could even get better at.

If you were to do a sport for your extracurricular activity there are tons and tons of reasons why that is a good thing to do. For instance if you did a sport then that will keep you in shape. Another reason is that you can make a lot of new friends that you could become best friends with. If you are anti social doing a sport could help you with that, you could socialize with more people. However if you become very good at the sport that you do you maybe even get a scholarship for going to college witch is very very good. It could also teach you how to become a good teammate and learn how to support people that you try to succeed with. Also It can help block out all the the negative things in your life.

You could become a Leader at your school. You could do that by joining the school council. If you became apart of the school council that means you could make changes in the school that you and the students think that you could benefit from and you would still be doing a extracurricular activity. If you were to become A school leader you could help kids find what they are good at and what they enjoy to do in there free time. You could also help the kids with to much that they have to do with school and other things such as sports, school ext... that need help with time management if they needed help with it.

Extracurricular activities could also help with stress. It could help you by talking to your friends in the same club or sport that you do to get stuff off your mind, to help you relive or reduce stress. If you dont have many friends and you are stress about it this could help you find friends that have the same interests as you. If you are doing a extracurricular that you enjoy doing that could help relive stress, because you are doing what you love to do. Also helps you get the stuff off your mind that you struggle with.

In conclusion those are some of the reasons why I think that students should do a extracurricular activity. There are many more reasons why this is good for students. There are reasons why this can be a bad thing but there arn't as many reasons and I think that the good overrules the bad. Thats why I think students should have to take a extracurrular activity.
