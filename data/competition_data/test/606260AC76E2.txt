Dear Principal,

I believe that policy 1 is better so that way during our lunch time or hall way time we can use our cells to call somebody if something got changed around like an after school thing. Or we can text our friends and just chat with them for a while, or like what if somebody had an emergency and they had to go to the emergency room and we didn't have a teacher by us but we had our cell phones, we could dial 911 and get some help then go find a teacher and tell them what happened. If we didn't have a teacher by us or our cell phone on us we would have to loose time to go find a teacher. But when it is class time the teacher should make sure our phone is off or if not take them to be sure we have our cells off.

If we couldn't have phones at school then what if something you did after school like a sport for your school was cancelled and the phone lines were dead or something or you just weren't able to use them, you could tell your parents during lunch or when ever you have a free time to tell them that stuff and to keep them updated about up coming events to plan things a little earlier or else when you go home you might have something planned by then.

Not all kids have cell phones but some kids don't get to see some of their friends either because they don't go to their school, or they're sick or you just don't see them much at school because you always have to get to class. We would want our cells to talk to other people. Plus if we were just board and we had nothing to do during lunch or hall way time, even though during hall way time, you only have like 3 minutes to get to class.

Most parents wouldn't allow their kids to text in school because they might get it taken away or something. But if they shut it off during class or gave it to the teacher the students wouldn't have to worry about getting their phones taken away. But as long as the student got the right phone back.

The students would most likely listen to the cell phone rules because at least they get to use them at some point and won't have to worry about when they see a teacher in the hall way they have to hide their cell or get it taken away.

But also in a way I do agree with policy 2, because kids could some how get answers from other students or some adult they know to get answerers for a test. But policy 1 would be better for the students as long as they followed the no texting in class rule so they don't get in trouble. But I would recommend giving you're cell to your teacher then at the end of class get it back but grab the right phone. Or else it would be bad for that student and then the student who took that other students phone would get in trouble and then the cell phone policy would be taken away.

Lots of kids wonder why we can't have cell phones during school, but other know why we can't have cell phones during school. Some kids wouldn't take the risk of getting their phone taken away by a teacher or even by some kid that just steals your phone weather you know it or not. But some kids would take that risk, just to talk to their friends or family. But the principal should also recommend cell phone carriers or cases so that way you don't loose your cell phone or get it stolen with out knowing. But policy 1 would be much better for the students. That way it's easier for them.
