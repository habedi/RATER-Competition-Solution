Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think the policy you should consider is the first one. Allowing kids to bring phones to school using them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phone is off and will stay off during class time. I understand why you may not want cell phones to be at school at all you may think were using them in class and distracting others. So if that happens I think you should put policy number 2 full in affect and i will support that dissuasion all the way. Still TEACHER_NAME you should give us an chance some one will say to there self oh I have to cut my phone of during class I don't want to ruin it for my self or others but can I give you some advice on adding a rule to policy 1. If a student chooses to bring his or her phone out during class it can get taken away and give students a warning if it rings the first time and take it on the second. Personally I don't see the wrong doing in having it out burring lunch or free time while no instructions or an lesson is being given because personally school is a little to boring and I think I speak for mostly every one when I say that.
