Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? These summer projects should be teacher designed, because students may want to make simple projects without putting much effort into them. Students may not learn anything from their own projects, because they could just be copying and pasting from the internet. Teachers can also make a list telling the students what is required for the project, making the project more effective.

Making the summer projects teacher designed would be better than making summer projects student designed, because students may want to make simple projects, without putting much effort into the work. For example, if Generic_Name were to work on a project, during his summer break, Generic_Name would probably rush and put random things on his project in order to say that he has done the work, because he may have other priority's, such as going outside and playing a sport or going to the swimming pool. For sure, tons of other students would do the same as Generic_Name. This means that making summer projects student designed wouldn't be the most brilliant idea. Making summer projects teacher designed means, teachers would want to see some fantastic work, instead of some junk that students would do.

Students may not learn anything from their own projects, because they could just be copying and pasting information from the internet. That is plagirism, which is illegal to do and students can get into trouble for that and by the way, students are not learning. Therefore, summer projects being designed by teachers is a great idea, because teachers can assign the students ways to write, instead of copying and pasting, and teachers can make powerpoints of the instructions, that the students must follow. The way students can gain knowledge on what they've done is by reading reliable sites, based on the topics that the teacher has given them and summarizing what they have read and making sure it makes sense.

Teacher's can make list's of the requirements that the students must follow for their projects, making the project spicy. For example, the teacher can require the students to write a certain amount of paragraphs in their own words, joined with pictures that relate to the students work, and even data that the student would have to collect, making students experts that they could even present their work to hundreds of people. This means students would have to put in time and effort to make sure they have learned something during their summer break, instead of just spending time on their phones, playing games, and not doing anything productive. Meaning that the requirements that the teachers give to the students is a huge role on how the students final product is going to look like.

Therefore, schools requiring students to complete summer projects to assure learning during their break, should be teacher designed. This means that the teachers should create the way the summer project should be made. Students should take time out of their summer break to complete a project that is informing and can help them learn more. At last, summer projects should be teacher designed instead of student designed.
