The face on Mars is it a alien message or a natural landform.

I would say it is a landform. Why I will give several reasons why I think it is a landform latter in the argumentative essay i will be typing for Istep.

One reason I think it is a landform is how in the world could aliens bulid such a good looking face that looks a lot like a real human. I don't get how would the even know what a human even looks like. If they had some sort of device the going around Earth taking pictures of us would NASA already know about it or the National Goverment.

My second reason why the face on Mars is a natursl landorm. Is how could the make it when it is made out of rock. Did they go find a rock and start just carving a human face into it, NO you want to know why because things like that on Mars can't be used, Why because if they could be NASA would have traveled to Mars by now. PLus how would they move heavy equipment to mve the rock with out NASA seeing it, we have several microscopes going around different places of Space looking at different plants and such. So how could they not have seen that.

And for my thrid reason why the face on Mars is a natural landform. The text stats that their was no sigh of alien sighs or symbols the made us think that the aliens made this creppy looking face. BUt people say sense the 1998 trip to Mars was very cloudy when they toke the picture of the face. So they had to go back for a third time in 2001 a final prove that it is a natural landform and that is what they did. They shot a amazing photo that provide that there was no alien sighs or symbols by the face or around it.

The 3 reasons I gave you today are reasons why this face is a natural landform not any anilen made thing. That would be creepy and not right in my eyes. And maybe other peoples eyes. But to some people they think this is a alien made face which makes them crazy because it is definently a natural landform made form high winds and strong storms.
