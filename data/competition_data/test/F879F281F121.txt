Dear Principal,

Most of the kids in school have C grades and cant get it up to a B grade so you need to leave the changes that are there now and do not change it. A lot of us want to be in sports but if u change the sports thing to B grades like none of us will be able to do sports and that will suck very badly for most of us. Do not change to rules of the school board. We like it the way it is and do not need to change it. We need it to stay the way it is we are happy this way not the other way. So please do not change it. We need it to stay the way it is or we will have to do something about it. I don't know what yet but I will you just wait. If you change it you will figure something out and attack you. So do not change it or you will get what is coming to you. We would like you more if you would put the school back the way it was before you came here.

love the students

P.S. We do not like you for all you have done to the school
