Phones & Driving

Many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although, this may be a norm in our daily routines, some people risk their lives by using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. By doing this, people can cause a hazardous driving experiences for themselves and others. The dangers can include, distractions that cause car accidents, property loss or even death. With the potential that phone usage and driving can cause so much harm, it should be a legal band to cease all cell phone usage while driving.

In 2018, the state of Georgia adopted the "hands-free" law. This law doesn't allow the phone to touch any part of the body while driving a motor vehicle. This means that any touching, texting, calling, dialing, reading emails, surfing the internet, recording, etc. are all banned while driving. Doing any of these activities cause distracting conditions that are dangerous and unsafe and can result in the driver straying, losing control of the vehicle, or crash.

According to NHTSA, 3,166 people died as a result of distracted driving, in 2017.

With this understanding, nothing on your phone is worth that much of your attention.

Death is a real possibility if the law is not taken seriously. In Georgia, there are about 4 accident related deaths per day and nearly 1,500 fatalities per year. A quick glance at your phone or taking your eyes off the road for as long as 30 seconds, can escalate to a lifetime of regret, pain, and sorrow for yourself or someone else's family.

This reason alone, should serve as enough rational to band cell phone usage all together or maximize the cost of fines for offenders of the "hands-free" law.

In the event, that there is an accident that is caused by violating the "hands-free" law or distracted driving caused by phone usage, it has unforeseen financial damages, as well. Although, insurance is meant to protect us, it's still at a cost. Each year it cost about $230.6 billion to United States residents for accident claims. This can place a heavy burden on any family that is under prepared for life's unexpected turns.

In conclusion, there are so many things in life that we cannot control that can result in financial burdens or death, we should ask ourselves is answering a text worth my life? I'm guessing its not but so often, we risk our safety to do just that. Not using the phone while driving is a behavior that can be controlled, especially, if we consider how important life, focus, and finances are. If we take the time to put the phones down while driving we can "arrive alive."
