limiting car usage has an advantage because insted of using a bunch cars which most people do people can use their feet to walk and jog and legs to ride bikes insted of just sitting in chair and moving a wheel around thats why in the streets of vauban germany they completely banned people from using cars so they can be more active by using their feet to jog,run and walk and their legs to paddle a bike an other advantage that car usage has is with driving banned the air will also be extremly clean and not polluted with dirty machine gas that means people will not have to breath with dirty air and will be able to breath good and fresh this why car usage is good not only for people to be active and not lazy but to keep the air fresh and clean so that people will stay heatlhy and of course so that mother earth could be healthy as well now that people will begin to use less cars they will go to stores and buy bikes to use and people will be selling alot more bikes so for once human being have really done something good for themseleves and planet earth because earth is the only reason why human beings and other life forms exist
