Dear Principal,

Students should not have cell phones on school campus. students use phones during class time and use them to cheat on tests. And in any case of emergency the school will contact the authorities. They do not need two thousand calls simultaneously. When a student is in class they start texting friends witch does not only distract the student who received the text message but the rest of the class. Also students will use there cell phones to ask people out during class. Students will also use them to cheat on tests and quiz's. Cell phones in class lead to lower test grades because a student is not concentrating with what's on the board there concentrating on not letting the teachers see them and on the matter that the person is texting them about. Cell phones at school are a bad idea. Cell phones have no place in school they should be kept at home.
