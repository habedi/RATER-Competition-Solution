I believe that this technology would be very useful for use in a classroom. This is so because this kind of technology could help determine how much, if any at all, help a student would need in dealing with their emotions. It would also help figure out what triggers certain reactions in certain students.

The first reason that this tech would work for students in a classroom is that it could help find out when a student is having a bad day and determine whether or not that student requires some form of psychiatric help. This kind of technology could help with depression, anxiety, and it could even stop the next school shooter, in an extreme case, yes, but possible nonethless.

The second reason this technology could be very useful is it could help the teachers understand what actions or words trigger what reactions in students. This is useful because it could be used to take a survey, collecting data and deciding what gives a bad reaction the most and least out of all the people being surveyed. This could be used to decide the curriculum, activities, etc.

Now, I understand that there are a decent amount of cons alongside the positive side of this technology, but I believe that the pros far outweigh the negatives in this scenario. When it comes to mental health, and, in the most extreme cases, lives at stake, technology like this is always a step in the right direction.
