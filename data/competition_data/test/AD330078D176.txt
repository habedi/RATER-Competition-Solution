Dear Principle,

I am writing you a letter based on the topic of you wanting to make community service a requirement for students at our school.

I think you making community service a requirement is a great idea. I know from experience that kids need to do community service. I think that it makes kids become better people and it helps their community too. Even if its a simple task like donating a can of food to a homeless shelter, I still think it is a good thing for students. Especially ones who can't seem to stay out of trouble. It sometimes even helps people get through a tough time just by seeing themselves put a smile on somebody's face.

I know that this will help kids and the community because I have experience with it. My neighbor has always been a trouble maker at school and in the community. But one day he got in trouble for something he did and he had to do community service hours. He learned that helping out people is a good thing to do and instead of doing bad things and breaking the rules, he helps out at a homeless shelter or organizes groups to pick up trash.

That is a reason that we should make community service a requirement at our school. And if our school starts requiring it, other schools in our town could start requiring it. Sooner or later, tons of schools around the world could be helping out their community and making the world a better place to live in.

I'm tired of seeing trash on the side of the road or people not caring about what's happening in their community. With your help I think we could change that in our community and even other communities around the world.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
