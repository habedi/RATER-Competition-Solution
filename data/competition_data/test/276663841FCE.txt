I think it is a good idea for community service to be required. for the following reasons 1)

kids will have less time to get in trouble, 2) it will help the environment, and 3)it will give kids something to do. So for those reasons i think community service should be required.

Community service should be required because kids would have less time to get in trouble. that means there will be less fights. less vandalism, and less money to fix it because community service is a non-profit organization. It also means that there will be less time to try drugs, with less time to try drugs there will be less addicts.

Second of all it will help the environment. By helping the environment you are saving trees, and when you save trees you help make paper, oxygen, etc. Also you make the air cleaner. That is the second reason that there should be required community service.

It will also give kids something to do. Kids are often bored and sit on their but and gain on wait. Also when they have nothing to do they go and get in trouble. that is my third reason

I think that required community service is a good idea because 1)

kids have less time to get in trouble 2) it helps the environment 3) it will give kids something to do
