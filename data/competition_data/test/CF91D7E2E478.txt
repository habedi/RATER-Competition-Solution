The Earth and Venus have somewhat in common which is allowing NASA want to do what they are trying to study for. Venus is the closest planet to the sun. Which will bring some problems to the project. But it won't stop NASA from trying to do what they are soon going to acconplish.

The author did a good job explaining and supporting his idea. Venus is alot like the Earth and it can also have some living things. "Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."

Their is a possiblitity that Venus will have some living things. And to find out about all this it takes risk. And thats what NASA is trying to do but carfully and slowly.

To conclude the autor did a good job explaining his point and also supporting his idea. Sooner or later NASA or someone else will go to Venus. And the truth will be told.
