Schools should offer online classes or video conferences because students could do their work when they're not at school, and it would save the school money; however, there would be a higher chance of them cheating.

First, if the student is not able to get to school, they could do there work at home. Sometimes, students also have family vacations during school; therefore, the students could work on vacation. My friend Generic_Name misses school all the time because of family events. Generic_Name's school offers online classes, which means Generic_Name can turn in his work even though he is not at school. Students would have more time to complete their work since they can do it after school. Students would be more likely to turn in their work with the extra time they have to finish it; the students would then have better grades and actually be able to keep their grades high.

Secondly, online classes would save the school money. Schools that have some classes that only online could save money because they would not need to hire more teacher. That means the school would have ore money to improve the school itself and make the online classes more effective. Schools could even charge a small fee for online classes, so that way the school would be making a small profit. Generic_Name's school has managed to buy all kinds of new equipment for charging for online classes, for example: laptops, desk, gym equipment, snack vending machines, desk, and chairs. Generic_Name's school still has extra money to spend on the classes.

However, it would be easier for students to cheat on assignments. Students have access to more website at home than when they are at school. They could also get someone else to do their work for them. Most of the time schools probably won't realize the student has cheated. If the schools buy the students laptops; they could block access to some websites, therefore, making it harder to cheat and easier to see what websites the students are viewing.

In conclusion, schools should have online classes because students could do their work at home, and it would save the school money; however it's easier for students to cheat. Having online classes would be very helpful to school. It would bring in a small income and allow more kids to learn.
