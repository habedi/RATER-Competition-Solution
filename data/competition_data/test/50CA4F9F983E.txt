changing the election to popular vote would I think benefit us and this country. Whats the point on voting for the president if the electoral college is going to do it and will pick the final decision. the electoral college cinsits of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president, but what about us who vote. I feel like there is no point in voting if the whole election is based off the electoral college. This electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that runs in each state. candidates dont spend there time in the states they have no chance in winning in, they only spend there time in the states they think they can win in. For example in 2000 17 states didnt even see the candidates at all! Some people in these 17 states didnt see one ad at all. Its not like us voters can control who there electors vote for because some voters get confused about the electors and sometimes can vote for the wrong candidate. Its not fair to us if we dont matter in this vote at all, especially when the people running dont send an ad out to every state and dont visit every state. The election is held every four years and we help choose our states elecotors when you vote for president because when we vote for the cadidate we actually vote for the candidates electors so it doesnt really make an impact on votes and i think that we should vote for the cadidates themselvesÂ  not there electors. So i think changing the votes to popular vote would benefit us all even if we dont get an ad or see anythin in our state even if the cadidates think they dont have achance in winning they should still participate.
