"So Mr. Ashwalt now that you've read the article what do you think."Mr. Ashwalt answering, "Well i think it pretty self explaitory it talks about Mars and that how he face on it from 1976 it has changed gradually in 2001." "Ah yes the atritcle also says that it had been twenty five years of change" I exlcaimed. Mr. Ashwalt questioned " Yes but i want to question how the rock formation happened to make a face in the ground." I anwsered "Oh yes good question it says here that it must have been degree of surprise among mission controllers on paragraph two of the article.

" Mr. Ashwalt asked "Yes and how come it has grabed the attention of many people about Mars having a face on it?" I anwsered "Another good question that i don't know the anwser to but my guess would be that, people have a interest on what happenes on something new." "Also Mr. Ashwalt what did you think when you first saw the picture?" Mr. Ashwalt anwsered "Oh I thought that it was partially real but it could have been fake but i kept reading and saw that it looked like a face because of the ilussions of the shadows by the sunlight reflecting." "Yes your right Mr. Ashwalt and where did you find that in the article?" MrAshwalt anwsered " I found it on paragraph three of the article."

"Good to know."

"I think I have a question for you." I answered " Yes sir? "Would you think that aliens have made this when you first saw it?" I anwsered "Not really because in the article on paragraph three that it was an illusion made by shadows." I questioned also would you think that. that's why it attracted so many people because people maybe thought it was created by aliens?" Mr. Ashwalt anwsered "I supose so but it's what other people think not me."
