The car is a staple in modern day society by many standards, it represents wealth, sociatal rank however; on the more negative side of the matter cars are the result of a majority of deaths in the United States. Alongside the fatalities, cars also pollute the environment that is so very delicate. The benifits of becoming car-free are immense and far outweigh the "negatives" that come alongside living without cars.

Cars as many people know see them are recognized for their glamour and attraction, but what is forgotten somewhere in the infatuation with cars is the true devastation they can cause. Cars in the United States and many other countries around the world account for a majority of the fatalities in total. Living without cars would completely irradicate the fatalities due to cars as well as reducing the stress that comes along with having such a hefty responsibility.

Along with the potential danger to humans, in the United States cars are the second largest source of emmisions right behind power plants according to paragraph 34. Countries like India and China are among the top few most polluted cities on this planet; now imagine the imact of implimenting a car-free law. The amount of pollution would go down immensely and the effect that this would have on the lifespan of people living in those countries would be incredulous. Some will argue that this will negatively have a change on their life. And to that I would say, are you willing to sacrifice some of the comfort that a car supplies you for a better life for your children and grandchildren?

Many people aknowledge that buying a car is arguably the second largest and expensive purchases that will be made in your life second to a house. The amount of money that would be saved from living a car-free life would be incredible. Without having to pay car payments, car insurance, and gas fees every month imagine what this money could be going towards. Removing such a monitary factor would reap such high rewards that so many would agree is completely worth some of the sacrifices that would have to be made.

All in all cars are not completely necessary, and that implimenting such a thing would have such a benificial outcome for society as a whole. Think not about the present but about the future of the world, and by living a car-free life you are bettering the present community as well as the future world.
