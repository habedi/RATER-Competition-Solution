You guys should be a Seagoing Cowboy beacause you get to travel around the world. First you would want to go because the article it says "Luke had also found to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds were animals had been housed. Tabled-Tennis tournements, fencing, boxing, reading whittling, and games also helped pass the time." Another thing is that "

It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Nations Relif and Rehabilitation Asmmintration). UNRRA hired " Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke and Don signed up." Finally " It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to be fed watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be clean." So it will be very fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy some may be hard work but you should try it one day.
