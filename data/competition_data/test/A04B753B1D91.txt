Dear principle,

Students shouldn't be required to perform community because they may not want to or because it should be for children that don't behave as they should. For example, someone robs a bank. They should be the ones that perform community service because they are the ones that committed a crime. The students that do all of their work and obey the laws shouldn't have to do something that people that commit crimes do.

Another example is when students in schools bully others. They should be the ones that community service for making another student's life miserable. A student that participates in study groups and does all of their homework should have to do community service unless they want to. In a way, community service is, in fact, a good thing.

My last example is when students write on school property. they should be punished for that. That is a form of damaging school property. You should be more worried about attacking these kids than the students that are very well behaved. This just isn't fair.

Therefore I stand against all students should be required to perform community service. I believe if all students are going to participate in performing community service that they should be rewarded with something good. To give you something to think about, I want to just say that it's not that easy to do community service so why should people have to do something that is hard even though they didn't do anything at all? That would just be ruthless. To make matters worse, most of the people that are required to do community service sometimes don't even do it. They just skip out and make the innocent ones do their work for them. Yes, I know that performing community service is a good thing for your community, but you shouldn't be required to do it. Making it mandatory is only going to make the economy worse. Students aren't going to want to come to school knowing that they will be punished for no reason. Thank you for taking the time to read my argument.

Sincerely,
