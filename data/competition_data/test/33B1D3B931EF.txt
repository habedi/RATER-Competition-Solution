This new technology would be a good thing to use in a classroom because a teacher would be able to determine a students reaction to a comment made from another student. Lets say a student was getting bullied, the teacher then would be able to tell how the student is feeling after what he just got called/made fun of them and would be able to make the apropriate action against the other student. But this technology should be used only for certain times in a classroom. The technology would be able to prevent fights in schools before they even happen.

But if the students in the classroom don't want their emotions read by a computer/ new technology they should have the right to not have their emotions read without them knowing. Also this technology would help the suiside problem in this world. It would prevent kids that go to school that get bullied realise what they have instead of going home crying in their rooms, locking the doors from their parents and eventually killing themselves because some student at the same school is bullying the other student beccause he is too selfish and doesn't think before they say something.

Bullying is a big problem and this new technology would be very useful in schools and across the globe. But there is pro's/con's to new creations that people make everyday and people around the world will continue to exspose them everyday.
