When summer break starts most students only think about the fun they are going to have over those 3 months. They don't think about learning or gaining knowledge over this period of time. In addition, students forget what they have learned over the course of the long school year. A great way for students to learn while on summer break is to be assigned summer projects. These projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year.

Although, students can be creative in making summer projects for themselves, teachers are better equipped for this task. A teacher makes lesson plans all year so students can learn and pass semester exams. Summer projects can be a cool and fun way to learn. For example, students can create a big poster or PowerPoint displaying all of the things they have learned in school that year. If a student were to create a summer project then they might take it easy on themselves instead of doing something challenging. However, a teacher will give their students a challenge so they can think and problem solve.

Each year students learn the same thing that they learned the previous year, however, they build on what they have learned. This is why it's important for students to stimulate their brains over the summer so the information is not lost or forgotten. If teachers assigned projects to students over the summer then they would have information fresh on their brains ready to use next year.

Consequently, summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year. These projects are a great way for students to learn and grow over the summer instead of playing video games.
