Dear Principal,

Community service is a very helpful thing towards the community, if its cleaning up after a high school game or planting a tree it will all have a positive outcome. I think it would be a good idea to have us do community service because there are a lot of things that need help being done and there are so many kids at school. If they all work together they could easily clean up a school step by step. Some children fail to see the opportunity that you are faced with and do not recognize that they could take ten minutes from their day for a good cause. I see why you are struggling with this decision, some kids might act up and also write letters to you about why we should not have to do anything. Others want to help the town, and show that they care. I personally would love to help you out.

I do not do community service a lot and only have once during school one year, but I understand that some things need done from time to time. During school my teacher had us go out to the high school football stadium and clean up after the past nights game. We went through the stands and picked everything up and placed it in plastic bags to dispose of. The trash was everywhere and it seems it was going to take years. Then after that we picked litter up near the school and in brush. I found it amazing how fast we finished the huge task because of the amount of people participating. I believe that if everyone from the school helped, they would finish rather quickly.

Sincerely,
