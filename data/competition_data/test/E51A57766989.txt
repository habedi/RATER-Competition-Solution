Dear Principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I play sports here at our school and do not believe it is right to only let children with a B average participate in sports. Many students can not play sports anywhere else but our school. If they do not understand the work given by teachers and have an average lower than a B they should still be able to play any sports they would like.

I understand that you believe that a student with an average of a B should only play sports, but I know for a fact that most students have a C average. This rule you are making would make for smaller sports teams and less student being able to exercise. I would like for you to take into consideration my argument for students with any average to be able to play sports. Students should be able to play fun sports after long days of school.

Students need to get exercise in almost every day and should not have it be denied because they are not as smart as other kids. Please listen to my fellow classmates just like me who would like to have you not change this policy about sports. Students need to play and need to learn as well. With both being provided by our school you should encourage students and not try to pass this rule trying to scare us to learn. Students need options and I believe you should not pass this rule. Thank you for your time reading my argument and I hope this rule is not passed.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
