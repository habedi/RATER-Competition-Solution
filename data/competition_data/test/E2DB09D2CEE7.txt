In the passage "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author writes about many differennt things that have stopped us from being able to travel to Venus. One big thing that causes a treat is how hot the planet really is. Another one is the atmosphere. One of the biggest of them all is that the planets are moving at different speeds.

Why is the planet so hot. Now no one really knows why the planet is that hot but not only is it to hot but the pressure in that atmosphere is also very high. The planet averages a temperature around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The amount of pressure in the atmosphere averages around 90 times grater then what we have on Earth. With these conditions it would make life on Venus for humans inpossible like it talks about in paragraph 3.

Another big thing that causes a problem for use is the speed of the planets. Even though Venus is the closet planet to Earth at other times Mars can be. So because the planets are moving at such different rates in speed this is making it hard for us to send thing to it because the timing of the planets is off. All of these are talked about in paragraph 2.

Although humans may not be able to vist Venus anytime soon these are some facts from the passage that help support that. So I think that the author did a good job at putting information in that supported what he had to say.
