Summer Projects

I feel that students should be able to plan there own projects over the summer rather than teachers giving them projects themselves. My reasoning be that students can be creative when making thee own projects and using there own ideas. My second reason is that students can complete it over time and do it at there own pace to know they completed the project correctly and finished it in the way tat they like it. My last reason is that it enables that students to have a open mind, rather than being controlled or having to use someone else's ideas.

The main reason why students should be able to design there own projects is so they can be creative. When students follow what a teacher wants they cant always be open minded. If students use there own ideas and make there own projects it allows for the student to be open minded and be more creative while doing the project. When using there own ideas it lets the students be more focused and have a more original idea. If all the students get told to do the same thing it makes the teacher have to grade the same project over and over. Rather than grading different projects that are more interesting and different.

The second best reason students should make there own projects over the summer is so they have as much time to do them as needed. Usually in class the teachers set a date for the projects to be due by which leaves the students stressed. When they dont have a lot of time students tend to rush threw the project not being able to complete it all in the time given. Bu if the students use threw own ideas and make it threw out the summer it makes the projects more entertaining for the student to make and lets them complete the project on there own time.

My last reason students should make there own projects is so that they have fun with it. Most of the time when you have to follow a piece of paper given to you by the teacher it leave the students bored and has them repeat the same information over and over. Rather than them making there own projects an having fun while doing so. It leaves the field of ideas more open when you can go off the things you know rather than looking it up on Google and always having to listen to a teacher. When you let the student use the information they know it allows the student to the type of person they really are which lets the teacher know what interest them and motivates them to maybe switch things p in class while doing assignments like those.

In conclusion I think that students should be allowed to make there own projects rather than having to listen to a teacher or have to follow a form. My reasons being that it lets the student be more creative and have them be more interesting. I allows the student the have fun with it and makes it more interesting for the teacher to grade. Lastly it gives the student more time to complete the project when they do it own there own and enables them to finish it correctly and not be stressed out. Thats why students should make their own projects.
