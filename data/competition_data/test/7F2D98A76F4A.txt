It is clear that in the the article "The Challenge Of Exploring Venus", the excitement for a possible oppertunity to explore Venus runs deeply with the author. The problem with excitement is that it clouds judgement, Venus should not be explored without a proper motive or strategy, and they don't yet have that. The article did poorly in convincing me that the pursuit for venus is worth it.

Venus is an uninhabitable place. Dispite the information that would vastly improve our knowledge about venus, it proves quite difficult and could put a life in danger. The heat on Venus greatly surpasses that of the average on earth, it is said in the article," Tempratures average over 800 degrees". The author of the story is working around the fact that its probably not going to happen, within a lifetime at least. The article mentions that Venus is reffered to as "earths twin", and it appears to be unmistakenably true at one point in its lifetime, given it's know structures and landforms, but Venus is no longer firtile and cannot support that of even our most protective items suitable for space.

NASA's involvement in attempting to send humans to venus is highly advanced, although the productivity is not the fastest, they are indeed attemting to get somewhere with their research. The best thing mentioned in the article was of the, "Vehicle hovering over Venus". It sounds like the title of a really interesting distopian sci-fi book but no, that was the big idea that the author referred to. I did quite like the idea only in that it was somewhat sensible, to collect data from up high, though unfortunately the density of Venus' surface wouldn't allow for any colection of data.

On the contrary to what is beleived to be, the author provided good evidence as to exciting new ways to hopefully one day be able to learn more about Venus, and understand our solar system at the very least by one planet more.
