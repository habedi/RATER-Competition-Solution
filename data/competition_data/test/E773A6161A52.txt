Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that all students should be required to perform community service . i don't think it should be used as punishment but to make our community a better and safer place to live. If we had more people to pick up trash and papers in the street candy rappers ex. then that would help make our community cleaner and it would teach students the importants of keeping there community clean not to mention that if more people are cleaning up the community then less people are littering in the environment. Also for all the struggling younger kids it would be nice to have some one alittle older with alittle bit more experience to help them out on tough assignments so that in the future they can say they know how to do it and the person that taught them how can be proud to show some of his or her intelligent to others. Tutoring is a great way to help our community. For those who think its a waste of time to do community service its to help out there own community no ones going to do it but us. Sometimes it doesn't have to be just our community we can help out others struggling with the same problems. I think its a great way to help make our world a better place to live. This is a great time to make a difference as a young person.
