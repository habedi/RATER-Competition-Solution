To whom ever it may concern,

I think we should be able to use our cell phones in school but not during classes. I think it is important because our parents gave us a cell phone for special and specific uses as in contacting them when something is wrong or for them to contact us if something is wrong in our family.

We should be able to use cell phone between classes or during lunch or free time such as break. During class have them on vibrate or silent maybe even turned off. We should of a policy saying we are able to have our phones at school anytime just not while a teacher is teaching because it can be a disturbance to you or others around you. In one simple way i do believe students should be able to have phones at school and in view.

Also in a way i do believe that students should not have cell phones out at school because it can be a big distraction to them. If we are able to have phones to many it wont bother but a few it might change the way they pay attention during classes. I would think its better to let us have our cell phones out at certain times like lunch break and when we change classes.

Thanks
