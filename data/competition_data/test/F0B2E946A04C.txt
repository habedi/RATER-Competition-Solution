I understand that there is an issue with cell phone during school hours. But I believe this issue is never going to go away unless we work our way around it. We are now in the twentieth century, technology is a big thing, especially to us teenagers. I believe that is a great idea to allow students to bring their cell phones to school and use them during our lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time.

I can understand why you wouldn't want to have cell phones during school hours. Some people might say it's a distraction, having students using their phones in class or their cell phones to go off during a lecture. Or some people just don't want students to have cell phones at all. But I say we should but the cell phones to good use.

Almost everybody has a cell phone, is one of the biggest technology used everyday. But I think we can do better then just using cell phones during free time and during lunch. I believe that we should use them in class. If we use projectors, computers, and other technical devices why not cell phones? Most cell phones have calculators, let you take notes, and much more. A student always have their cell phone with them, so they could study more frequently. You can't carry a notebook around all the time like you do a cell phone. You could also record a lesson and watch it or listen to it when you don't understand, sometimes just reading and going over notes isn't enough. Less people would be getting in trouble if cell phones weren't an issue. Of course there are going to be times when a child is caught not following the rules, but everyone messes up were only human. Teenagers are always going to be tempted to break the rules. If you tell them they can't use their cell phones, they are going to be tempted to do it, and some people will.

Not allowing students to have cell phones would very much upset them. Most schools make the students put their cell phones in their locker. But most of them won't, if they put their cell phone in their locker they are most likely going to forget it and leave it at school. Which would lead to more problems. Most people are very dependent to their cell phones. So telling them that can't have it will not work. Students will always have their cells phones so why not work around it and maybe use them?

But if you can't use them during class perhaps just allowing students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times is a wonderful idea. it's nice to just have fun at school every once in awhile, especially if your cramped up in a classroom for several hours. We are young adults I believe we can handle it. I hope you take what I said into deep consideration and allow us to use our cell phones.
