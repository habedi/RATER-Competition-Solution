THERE SHOULD BE COMMUNITY SERVICE!

Well my opinion on weather there should be community service or not i saw yes there should be we need to have the school clean and looking good.

My first opinion is well because we cannot be having trash all over the school because if we do and we ever have a visitor or someone who is going to enroll and if they were to see all the trash and mess everywhere they would probably not want to be here. If our parent saw all the mess they would take us out of school to a different one were it wads cleaner, and if the owner of the school were to come he/she would fire all of the teacher janitors maby everybody because it was such a mess they would think we don't know how to take care of our school. If a cop were to pass and see the kids just dropping stuff on the floor they would get tickets.

For the people that don't think this is important they are wrong because that just means they are dirty and don't like to help others or keep clean! I think everybody should at least help out if they see a peace of trash even if its not yours just pick it up through it away it not going to kill you for being good and keeping it clean. Or after school we could have a group of kids just to help out pick up trash go around making sure our school looks the best then we could have like a pizza party or something a small one just for the people who are nice enough to help out. It is VERY

important to have it clean! Also if you ever see someone drop something just tell them hey pick that up through it away. We could all help yes i think the principle should have that for us. We all need to learn how keep clean we could just do it after school during school could have monitors. Those who don't want to let them they just don't care or want to keep clean that there problem! Also it will impress a lot of people they will want there kids to come here they will say this the best most cleanest school in the district the school will be better off like that i would love to help out and keep my school clean.

Well this was my opinion on if we should have community service or not and yes we should it be good we will improve a lot. Our school s the best!
