Teachers work much harder than students do. They make lesson plans, attend countless meetings, and grade their student's assignments. Why would they want to work harder than already do? Summer assignments are not meant to be grueling tasks for the student or the teacher; simply, they overview materials pertinent to the class so that during the school year, teachers won't have to spend time going over fundamental concepts and students won't have to spend time relearning old topics. If teachers were to assign summer projects, they would give a solid foundation for the curriculum of the class, teachers could be of help to students who don't understand, and it would make both the student and the teacher's school year easier.

Knowing and teaching a curriculum to a class is the basis of a teacher's job. Because of their experience with students and knowledge of the school system, a good teacher is in the best position to divvy summer assignments to an upcoming class. For example, accelerated math classes require a strong grasp of basic concepts. Going into calculus, being proficient in algebra, trig identities, properties of logarithms, and knowing graphs are a few of the many fundamental concepts that are frequently applied before doing any actual calculus. The average student would not go out of their way remember what they learned so many years ago. If a teacher is trying to teach their students new mathematical concepts and they don't have these basics, then the students will fail to understand. Because a teacher would have access to the proper prerequisites, a teacher-designed summer assignment would include the most integral topics required to be successful in their course.

Even with Google and countless online videos and articles, the most efficient way to learn would be one on one with a professional. A virtual lesson cannot give a student the same feedback that a teacher can. For example, in Latin classes, noun and verb endings can be memorized as easily as the alphabet. However, identifying how those endings relate to all the different grammatical constructions can be difficult. Google Translate cannot explain why certain endings change the meaning of a verb or a noun, its algorithm only spits out an inaccurate and basic translation with no regard to context. A readily available teacher could review the whole translation in context, go over any confusion of grammatical concepts, then supplement their explanation with some credible resources for the student to use. Unlike school, the teacher will not always be there to help, but they wouldn't set their students up for failure either. With enough guidance, students can learn on their own and teachers will consequently recognize how their different students will learn best during the school year.

Being a teacher requires so much patience towards their students, co-workers, and higher ups. They can really only attempt to control the student aspect. Dealing with student and parent complaints would be so detrimental to a teacher's morale, so why would they make assignments that their students mostly dislike? Not only that, but grading challenging and dynamic assignments would be so tiring and time consuming. After break, that simple summer assignment puts a letter in the grade book and, if done correctly, makes the students feel accomplished and primed for learning. Now that the students are equipped with a basic understanding of the class and the teacher has begun to understand the learning patterns of their students, the school year is set up to be smooth and successful.

Even though students might complain or question at their teacher's methods towards learning, they are professionals and know what they are doing. A teacher should want their students to be as successful as their potential allows, so the teacher-designed summer assignments would be reasonably challenging and include the most important topics with regards to the subject. If properly executed, teacher-designed summer assignments are best suited to set up an easy and enjoyable school year.
