Summer projects are sometimes assigned to students to encourage them to keep learning over the Summer. These projects should be designed by the teachers rather than the students. The teachers are in charge of the classroom throughout the school year and should remain in charge of projects over the Summer. It would be easier for the students and teacher if it is this way. Projects should be designed by the teacher because students would stay on topic, be able to receive help from the teacher, and wouldn't take as long to complete the project.

If the teacher provides specific details for the project to the students, then no student would be confused about what to do. Every student would easily be able to stay on topic and follow the instructions of the teacher. The teacher could design a rubric for the students so every student would know what they need to have on the project. A rubric would also make it easier for the teacher to grade by checking off what the student has based on the rubric. There wouldn't be many different kinds of projects that are hard to compare and grade. Additionally, some students may struggle with creativity and coming up with their own idea for a project. So, having guidelines to follow would assist these students in completing their project and level the playing field so struggling students do not get outshone by more creative students.

Teachers may also be able to provide supplies and help to students if the project is predetermined by them. Before the school year is over the teacher can assign the project and give out the supplies needed to complete the project to students who may need them. Having the supplies given to them can help students visualize the finished project. The students wouldn't receive a bad grade for using the wrong materials. The teacher could also easily answer questions if they came up with the project. Students could e-mail teachers with questions over the Summer and the teacher could respond quicker and clearer if they knew everything about the project.

Some may argue that students procrastinate if they know what the project is. This may be true, but if the project is laid out for them, it can be completed faster than an unknown, student-designed project. If a student has a project that they must design them selfÂ then they may be slow to start it since there are no steps or guidelines to be followed. If a project is designed by the teacher, then the requirements are listed beforehand and a student would more likely get something done earlier because it is clear on what they must do. However, if the student does decide to procrastinate, then it would be much easier for them to complete a given assignment rather than make their own and complete it on time.

Having teachers design Summer projects rather than students is easier for everyone. Students can receive help and supplies from teachers and have guidelines to follow. They may also complete the project quicker and on time. Teachers can grade the projects easier by following a rubric and answer questions easier if they have designed the project. In conclusion, Summer projects should be designed by teachers not students.
