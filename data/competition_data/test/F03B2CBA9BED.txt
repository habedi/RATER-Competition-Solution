Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME. I feel that students should perform community service because the world needs to become a better place. Everyday many birds and animals at sea die do to pollution and the garbage thrown in the water. People eat whatever it is their mom or dad packed for them and they throw that plastic in the water only causing another animal to suffocate and die crucially. Even if that piece of plastic was thrown on the floor do to all the wind it can end up right in the ocean. I feel that this whole community service is like a processed sequence because someone liters and another person picks it up and it goes on over and over and it doesn't help the earth as a whole. I know that if we can all come together and clean up this earth it will make it not only a better environment for the animals but for us humans. As more people see us clean up the world they will start to join. They should raise the price on littering to however much it takes to get this earth to a better and cleaner place. So in my eyes I believe that community service is appropriate in everyway possible. Now even though I believe students should do community service I also believe that adults should to because as mentioned earlier if everyone participates this will in deed make the world a better place.
