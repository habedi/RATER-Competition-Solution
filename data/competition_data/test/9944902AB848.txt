I think that sudents that stay home and take onlie classes is beneficial because some students learn better and understand the material better when they take the class online. there are a few other reasons why online classes are benefical and i can name a few. One reason why online classes are beneficial is that if the student does go to school and if he/she is sick that day he/she can take an online class that will teach him the material and doesn't have to worry about making up the work he missed or being behind other students because he/she caught up with the material that they learned that day. Another reason whay onlie classes are beneficial is if the sudent is on vacation they can go onilne to make up the work that they missed and learn the lesson or material from that day. A student that takes online classes doesn't have to worry about there gardes, they don't have to worry if they missed a lesson, they dont have to worry if they are behind because they took onlie classes to catch up with any work they missed.

There are some students that like to go to school, but lets say that some of does students didnt go to shool because the were eather sick or they are on a long vacation. They are gunna worry a bit becasue they missed a day or a few days of school work. Thse students are not gunna worry as much because they are able to take an onlie class to catch up with school work, learn the material, and don't have to worry about having low gardes because they took an online class so they can catch up with school work that they missed. Some students learn better in the comfert of there own home bc they can pay attention more and won't be distrcted as easily like some students do in school. they will be able to finish or catch up on school work because they'll have a lot of time to catch up on materials that they missed and have lots of time to finish up school work or homework.

students that stay home and take online classes are beneficial. they can easily catch up on school work, finish any school work or homework, learn the materail on time, doesn't have to worry about low gardes or work they missed, learn better and so much more. Online classes are beneficail for students that like to saty home or for students that missed school because they were either sick or on vacation. Onlien classes are beneficail no matter what.
