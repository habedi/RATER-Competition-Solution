The preservation of human consciousness is essential to understanding our universe, this being said I am unfortunately uninterested in this topic because my summer is more intense academically then my school days, but this is a great prompt for an eleventh grade written paper and I will gladly show my gratification for the chance to become a more intellectually stable human being and discover the proper way to advance my knowledge in what I don't know. Thank you for the first steps.

After thinking about this topic and realizing that I'm not in any position of power I figured out that some students are not exactly thankful and do not care about their education even though the learning structure in Virginia is incredible compared to other countries, or even states. But unfortunately too many students choose less significant factors of education. Of course what I mean by this is we don't focus on the most important topics, instead being more focused on the social attribution that the schools give us. In my personal opinion summer break should disperse around the school year evenly so education can be taught all year allowing for; minimum stress, better attention in schools, and so summer isn't the most look forward to part of the year, unfortunately though this will not happen until more students understand the quality and purpose of education. Getting to the point, I believe that students should put multiple efforts into discovering foreign countries to learn how grateful we should be to have a function able learning system.

These experiments should be created by the teachers since they have the intuition to complete a task and will make proper choices to make sure the students arent overwhelmed with stress, but a considerable amount of mental stimulation is pushed into action with each chosen summer project. Unfortunately some teachers may have lost connection to how they felt when they were in the position of the student, but this can be a good thing since the more intellectual discoveries one experiences, the better choices they will make through out their lives, and for the lives of others.

Some may argue that each student knows what is best for themselves, since each person is unique and no one project will interest every student, and I agree with this to a certain degree. So a multitude of different projects should be able to be a student selective of types and display an exciting amount of variety. such as; building homes, masonry work, political and economic trips to different parts of the country and projects that allow the knowledge of how beautiful this world's natural state can be, but it doesn't have to be expensive, it can also be as much as local viewpoints and a reading quota to make sure that the students are involved in furthering their education while outside of schools.

So to wrap this all up with a pretty bow, I believe that students should not be allowed to choose our own path of development, inside and outside of the campus. Education should be left to the people with a strong knowledge to ensure proper development for every student. Thank you for reading and I hope to receive insight on how to better my opinions and persuasive writing abilities.
