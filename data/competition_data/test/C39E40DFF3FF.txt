Dear principle,

I believe that the policy shouldn't change the same because lot of students would like to participate in sports such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, or other sports. Some students have difficulty's in subject's. Instead of having to get a B+ we should leave it the way it is. That way more student would participate in sports. Many students believe that this new policy is unfair because they could be having a problem in math or other subjects and they might not get the help they need. Honestly i agree with them. Teachers might also be pressuring them to cutch or not teaching well. Also, there are some students that do there homework and get good grade in quizzes but when it comes to the test they forget everything like they never even learned it. I also believe that the student's should get more help after school or at lunch that way the have more possibility's to succeed and then they would get better grades and would be able to participate in sports. Now that's what i think that should happen if you make the new policy. also other students wouldn't just want to participate in just sport they might want to go in an art class or would want to be in leadership. Now i also believe that you are being to harsh on the students. They might want to join a sport or other activities but they wont be able to because of there grades. Students come here to learn and get to spend more time with there friends but most of all they would want to participate in fun activities that way they wont get so bored in class or in school. Many other students don't have nothing to do at home they would get bored of playing video games or the same thing over and over again. That's why i believe that the police should stay the way it is.

sincerely
