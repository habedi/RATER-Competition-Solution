Phones and Driving

Driving while using your phone shouldn't be allowed. There's people who are more afraid of getting hit by a distracted driver than getting hit by a drunk driver. Even though they are making new laws to help distracted driving it's not enough to solve this problem. People break laws all the time just because you make the one touch rule doesn't mean it solves the problem. Now the day enforce this rule and start finding or revoking people licenses.

The dangers of distracted driving are very high. This is a serious matter people are dying every day because of distracted driving. 3,166 were killed by distracted drivers driving in 2017. At Least 9 people are killed every day, and more than 1,000 injured daily from something as little as a phone. I would expect a bigger cause to so many deaths; people don't understand that driving while on the phone is like the butterfly effect. One flap of the wing and it could destroy someone's life.

Driving with a phone could destroy someone's life in a matter of seconds, you can destroy your own life in a matter of seconds.

Driving while on your phone can ruin your life in a matter of seconds. More than 481,000 drivers are currently using their phones while driving. Even though there's all cellphone ban in 21 states and one touch only ban in 48 states people still use their phones. Two seconds is all you need to crash your car no more or no less. It's that easy and people don't realize that a snap of the finger you could be dead. It takes two seconds to not see that motorcycle or two seconds to not see that child crossing the street. Even if you yourself are not injured you can really do some damage to a person that's not in a car. You have protection of your car the person walking has nothing, but themselves.

People need to wake up and stop smelling the roses. What will it take? How long will it take for you to change your ways? What will it cost you for you to realize that putting your phone down for a 10 min drive vs putting your own life or someone else's life down for ever is more important. Not even one tap should be allowed because that one tap can also cost lives. People should have their licenses revoked for driving while on the phone. This is no accident this is manslaughter; it's an accident that could be avoided. 8/10 times a call or text message is not that important that it costs death/injury.
