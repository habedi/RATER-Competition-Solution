I believe that the summer assignment should be a student-designed project, because though students would be doing work it would keep them engaged, they would put forth more effort in their own creativity than a teachers, and to continue their learning they could do it on something they wanna learn or are interested in. Everyone learns at different paces and in different ways, so having their project be something they chose would show the kind of person they are and help with teaching them in the future. A student designed project is the best way to peak and interest while keeping learning in the game.

First, having the summer project be a student designed assignment would keep them engaged even though their doing work. Nobody enjoys doing school assignments especially over break, but getting to pick what it's on and what it looks like is a good way of keeping the attention while having it be entertaining. When you get to be the master mind behind something you do is doesn't feel so much like work. Keeping students engaged is also a very hard task, so the more involved the student the better it is for everyone. Also, the more engaged a student is with something the more they wanna do, and the better they'll wanna make it.

Next, more effort will be put in for their own creativity than a teachers. When making an assignment designed by a teacher I personally always do what I think the teacher would like and appreciate, granted I add my own flair but I always have the teachers opinion in the back of my mind. But, when I get to design something myself based off my own creativity it comes out ten times better. A project is meant to please the person making it not the person assigning it. Creativity for all students is completely different whether it be through color, design, or presentation. So when a students gets to make their own project design it amplify's their creativity level.

Lastly, to continue a students learning they could do it on something they wanna learn about or are interested in. One student could do it on a past president where another student could do it about Sociology, it'd all be based on them and what they chose to wanna learn. I would personally make my project about Psychology and the therapeutic side of it, making a presentation on the pros and cons. Someone else could do something entirely different. That's the amazing and fun part of a student designing their own project while learning as well.

Now, some believe that teachers should design projects being given to students because they think the student won't do it if they get to pick what's done, or they believe the student will do it on an inappropriate topic, or that they'll half way do the assignment. But that's not always true, in some cases it is, but it's also based on the type of student. I believe if the teacher were to assign something that if the student found it boring then that's when they wouldn't do it or only halfway do it. You can't make an accusation about all students based on what a minor few may do, you have to factor in everyone that will be doing the summer project.

In conclusion, I do believe that the summer assignment should be a student-designed project, because though they'd be doing work it would keep them engaged, they would put forth more effort in their own creativity than a teachers, and to continue their learning they could do it on something they wanna learn or are interested in. A student could surprise you with what we can do when given the chance. So a student designed summer project sounds like a brilliant idea on so many levels.
