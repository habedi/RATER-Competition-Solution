Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than just taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls for the animals.

Doing this, it could open up your eyes to a new world and explore new places.

Luke though it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, he says. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

The fact that Luke thought helping all of those people in need, shows you that he wanted to help them.

But, not only was he taking care of the people and helping them, he was also helping the animals. I think he also liked taking care of the animals himself.

When people think of a Cowboy, they see someone wearing cowboy boots and riding a horse.

They also see a farm with a whole bunch of animals.

If someone is a cowboy, they normally like animals and taking care of them.

Like also liked the trips coming back. They played baseball and volleyball games in the empty stalls where animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that also helped pass the time.

You also got to visit unique places.

Luke got to go to Greece, China, and even toured an excavated castle in Crete.

He also marveled at the Panama Canal, during his trip to China.

Since Luke didn't just go once, he must have enjoyed going on the trips and helping people.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy can open up a new world to you. Not only does it let you visit new and unique places, you get to help animals and people that are in need of it.

It sure was like that to luke.
