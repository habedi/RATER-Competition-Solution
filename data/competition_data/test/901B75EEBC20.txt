Is this photo an alien artifact or just a natural landform? This is just a natural landform,for one we have facial looking landforms on are planet, why cant there be on other planets? Also if this was true, NASA wouldn't hide this because if they were to discover ancient civilization they would earn alot of money.

To start off there are different looking landforms on are planet why can't there be others. In the first set of pictures it shows the landform changed,so a face wasn't there to begin with,it was forming over time. Also sometimes when the human mind is told something it would try to shape together to form what was said, so this could be just a natural landform and your mind is changing it.

Also NASA would not keep this a secret if alien activity was found in this area,if anything NASA would make alot of money off of this discovery if it did have to do with aliens. But if NASA wanted to keep it a secret they wouldnt have took a picture and let the media get ahold of it they would have kept the pictures stashed away. Also the media is known to blow things out of proportion.

In conclusion of my argument,we have tried and tried for many years to find something unatural or indifferent on another planet,eventually we would have stumbled upon something, but its just a landform,no alien activity. My question is after reading this argument couldn't this massive piece in history just turn out to be a rock?
