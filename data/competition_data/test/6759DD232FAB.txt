Limiting car usage has many advantages. It would have advantages like less pollution in the atmosphere, congestion bewteen the streets would be reduced, and people would be more interactive with the outside world. The limitation of car usage has showed many improvement all over the world.

According to the first source in the passage "In german suburb, Life goes on without cars" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. In source 2 "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, it says that when there is cold nights and then it is warm during the day, the warmer layer of the air traps the gas emissions from the cars. There are all statements that prove that the gas that is emitted into the air by the car affects our atmosphere. If there is tons of cars out during the day all at the same time, they are all polluting the air which affects us all. The amount of pollution coming from factories and other things is already way too much for us to be adding even more gas emission into the atmosphere. Also, there are not only little cars but different sizes of cars ranging from extra large to small. Some cars let out more polution than others but when all the pollution from all the cars come together, it is a gigantic problem.

Congestion is something that happens in many places where cars are used alot. In Miami, congestion is a big problem and it is very stressing specially during afterschool hours. In souce 2, it says that when France passed the law in which even- numbered or odd-numbered license plate had a certain time where they could not drive, the congestion went down up to 60 percent in the capital. Imagine the amount of congestion that was avoided each day by passing that law. In source 3, they state that they had a car-free day in Bogota, the capital of Colombia and it left the streets devoided of traffic jams. They also assure that it was a great way to take away stress. Stress is often caused by very long traffic jams in very populated cities such as Miami or Bogota.

If the usage of cars was limited, people would be more interactive. We would see more people walking and riding bikes. We would car-pool with friends and instead of just driving to a place where the person is going to be in a car from point A all the way to point B, people would interact more with one another. Talk to people while they walk, use public transportation and it would benefit local bussiness even. In sorce 1, they say that in the new approach of limiting the access of cars, stores would be placed by a walkside, somewhere you can walk to instead of being placed inside a mall along a distant highway. In source 3, it says that the limited amount of automobiles has lead to the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, parks and sports centers have bloomed and even the sidewalks have improved!

The advantages of limiting the car usage are so great. Not only do they reduce pollution and congestion but also make people become more interactive with the outside world. It is something that benefits us all in many ways.
