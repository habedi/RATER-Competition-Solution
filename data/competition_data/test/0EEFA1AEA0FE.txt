Venus, the second planet from our sun, the "Evening Star" as some say is referred to as Earth's "twin." The atmosphere of this raging planet is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, the clouds are formed of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. This planet named Venus is deemed inhospitable by the author of this passage, yet the author feels he/she should express and support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

The author supports the idea that Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus has a rocky surface of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author also includes the statement that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been working on different types of equipment to be able to behold many different methods to send technology to Venus. The author states that this technology will allow humans to further understand Venus's complex array of difficulties presented by wanting to send exploration teams to the planet.

The author allows the reader to have a clear view into why it is valuable to be able to have the tools to explore Venus in the near future. He/she shows that human curiosity could lead us into situations where we need this certain technology to help us with different challenges presented in the future. Humans have a lot to learn not only about the problems we face when trying to meet exploration needs, but to gain the valuable insight the author states learning about Venus has. Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus could lead humans into expanding their knowledge to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation the author feels so strongly that humans should aspire to reach.
