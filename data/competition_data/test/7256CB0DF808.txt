i think it is very valuable because it knows if youre happy or or sad which helps in a lot of ways. another intresting example would be "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."and the technology is so good it can make computer animated faces more expressive accroding to the text and can too for surgery videos. and the computer may not detect your emotional communication but noted dr. huang said "so computers need to understand that too.

"The proccess begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face" and all 44 important muscles in the model must move like human muscles."it also says that we may some times not really know what is wrong with our friends and sometimes we can becaus of there facial expresion. or just behavior in general but sometimes they dont want to show that emotion or what is in them the computer can detect all of that.

so i personally think it would be great because some people are usually shy and wouldnt really express there selfs to the class as if they were with there friends. so all we would have to do is just by a sinlge glimpes on the computer we can tell what is going on maybe something happend. and she doesnt really know what to do so she seeks help from a counceler and she just checks what is going on with her and just by that maybe her whole life could change by checking the computer. tech is advancing a lot and is helping the sociatey positivley and yet negativlily but hopefully one day it will all come down to nothing but potive stuff.
