The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because the person could be really down or mad a math problem. Also in the text it said that when a student is confused or bored it can tell that they are so the computer will give them a problem they understand. Plus if a student is having a bad day the computer can detect that so the teacher could ask the student if they need someone to talk to or if he or she needs to go chill out in the health office. the computer can tell that your mad, sad, or felling sick to your stomach because it reads the mucels in your face like when your eyebrows go up from getting suprised or how your cheek bones go up from smiling. Also the computer know the percentages of your feeling the computer can tell you that your 80% happy and that your 10% mad and your 10% bored.

The computer can also tell if you dislike the ad its showing so it wont show anything similar to it but if it shows that you like the ad the computer will put another ad similar to the one you smiled or laughed at. Dr. Huang and his colleague made this kind of computer so that we humans can have better computers and better ways to communicate with each other. So we would know if someone is mad, sad, or glad so we can help them out with what they are going through. But the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. But all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Huang relises that Dr. paul Eckman creator of facial action coding system has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness then associated each with characteristic movments of the facial muscles.

plus the computer can also identify mixed emotions. the computer can also detect a painting of a face like Mona Lisa. Things like this that detect emotions can help schools parnets and friends to know whats going on with the person and so they can help. But one of the good things about it is that the things you see on the computer you like to see will have something similar to the ad or video you watch. Also the things you didnt smile at wont pop up on your screen because it didnt grab your attention.
