Dear Principal,

I think everyone should have to do the community service. I think it is important for kids to be involved in that kind of work. It helps the community they live in and it helps them. If they did community service they would be able to put that on their things to get into college. It would help them get a better education and it would help the community stay clean.

Kids and people both say that they don't have time because they are busy. They are busy doing what they want to do, not what they have to do. There is a difference! I am not saying that it is bad to do what you want sometimes but it's good to help out on your community. People that drive by throwing things out the windows are wrong. But we can make it clean if we just pick up a few things. If we had everyone working on it then each person wouldn't have to pick up that much. Kids and people need to learn that they can have fun and do what they want but also pick up and make the community look nicer.

If you are one of the ones that is picking up then you need to get your friends to help out. You need to get all your friends together and help make your community a better place to live in. I think you, principal of this school should get them to learn that because if we could get friends and even parents to help out then I think we could make it beautiful outside. There is only one way to do that though, and that's to get everyone picking up around here. Don't only get kids but get parents too. Parents can help out even though they are not at the school. Simply telling them to stop throwing things out the window will help some.

For all the reasons I have listed, I think you should make everyone help pick up. They are not too busy that they cant help the community. They can separate the hours they do what they want, what they have to do, and the time they spend making the place they live in a better one. Send out a letter saying that they need your help. Not just the kids but the parents too. Picking up the litter doesn't only save the land, but if you live by an ocean is saves the sharks, dolphin's, and many other water creatures. One person can't make all the difference, but getting everyone together and all helping out can. Anything is possible when you have everyone working for it.

your student,
