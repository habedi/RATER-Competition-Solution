Students should have free time to get away from class for a while but some do not want to get away from class . So it is wrong that the principal is forcing this pressure on students to have to participate in at least one "extracurricular activity". Some students enjoy sports or student council and year book staff but some also enjoy spending time in class and paying attention and getting their work done. So you can't force them to participate in other stuff that they might not enjoy . So Why put pressure on them and say that they have to do this or do that ?? And what if there's not good options to pick from then that puts even more pressure on the student . There is no reason we should have to take at least one activity that liberty believes is benefiting the students when really all it's doing is putting stress on the students .

What if the options they have is not what the students are interested in. Because some are in to sports and you have to be good at that sport if you want to make the team. But then lets say the students does not make the team that leaves them with the other stuff they may not want to do, but it's not optional according to the principal we have to take some sort of extracurricular activity but some people arent good enough to do what they really enjoy so dont put un needed pressure on them .
