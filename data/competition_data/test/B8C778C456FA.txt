Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? While there are many schools that require you to show up and attend everyday, there are other methods of learning. One of the biggest is attending school from home. Online learning from home that provide visuals and conferencing that could help students if needed. This could be a great option in some cases.

Having done online classes myself, I dont think its beneficial whatsoever for learning at home. Having the opportunity of take an online class or classes at home leaves you with a very heavy responsibility. You have to be dedicated and a drive that pushes you to strive for success. Thats something I didn't have when taking online class from home and I failed horribly. I was too busy worried about other things rather than focusing on whats important and what needed to be done.

In some cases some students learn better in school rather than being at home. Online learning, especially at home could be very challenging even when help is provided. Instructions provided from the classes could leave out valuable information. Being a student myself, I find it easier being taught rather than having everything done on a screen, because they can help you solve or get where you need to be. I think attending a school and having an online class is the best solution, therefore you can always ask for help one on one in person.

Every students dream is to be at home laid back doing things you can't at school; you also have access to everything you don't. Being at home you have all the freedom you can and having an online class fighting against that, having freedom just might win that battle. While attending a school, some students dont even make an effort to do homework at home so what could that mean for attending school at home. So no, I dont think attending school from home is beneficial for students.
