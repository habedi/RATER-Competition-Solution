Dear Principal,

I recently heard about how you are reconsidering the use of cell phones at our school. I think this is a good topic to consider since so many teenagers have cell phones now and technology is being used more and more in schools. I feel that we should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I don't think that we should not be allowed to bring our phones to school at all.

The reason why I don't think the policy that we shouldn't be allowed to bring our phones to school at all is because this rule will always be broken. Yes, you could say that the phone will be confiscated if a teacher finds you using it, but that won't stop kids from still bringing their phones. They will still sneak it into class and use it. Another reason is that if there is an emergency and the students have their phones, it could help a lot.

I think out of both policies, the one where we would be able to use our phones during free periods and lunch times only would work out best. You may be thinking that they will still try and sneak them into classes, but I can guarantee there will be a lot less of that. If kids know that they can use their phones during lunch and free periods, it will take the temptation away from using them in class. Another reason why they probably won't use it in class if this policy goes through is because if it does get confiscated, they won't be able to use it until the end of the day. If the policy where we wouldn't be able to use cell phones at all goes through, then it won't matter as much. If the policy where we can use our cell phones at certain times goes through, it will matter a lot. This is because if you phone gets confiscated before lunch or your free periods, you won't be able to use it. So I know that if it was me, I would wait because I would know that I would be able to use my cell phone soon without the risk of getting caught.

I know that you and most are teachers are probably thinking that the policy where students don't get to use their cell phones is the better choice, but I can bet that it won't be. If students know that they will be able to use their phones at school, it will raise the mood and they will be looking forward to the times when they can use them. It will probably lead to less students sneaking their phones into class also.

I hope you consider my reasonings and go with the policy I think will work. Thank you for reading this.

Sincerely,
