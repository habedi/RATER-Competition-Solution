Many probelms that our world is facing right now are pointed back to car usage. Problems such as congestion, high levels of smog, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions in many places are all discussed in these articles.

These days people can't get see themselves going on with their life without a car but in places such as Bogota, Columbia they have a set date called "The Day Without Cars". The day without cars is a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.(paragraph 20) Many people in Bogota choose to hike, bike, skate or take buses in order to get to work or wherever else they need to be. Some Colombians even enjoy it, such as businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who said "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." (paragraph 24)

In the article "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars," places such as Vauban, Germany are even giving up the usage of cars. Vauban's streets are completely "car-free". (paragraph 2) A media trainer and mother of two in Vauban named Heidrun Walter described how the change to not using cars has affected her in a positive way when she said "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." (paragraph 3) Experts say that automobiles have a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. (paragraph 5) When places like Vauban begin to reduce or completely end car usage, the greenhouse gas is also reduced and helps to reach the goal of a more healthy and clean society.

The article "Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog," Talks about cities such as Paris that have tried to forcedly ban driving. The reason for doing this was in hope to "clear the air of the global city." (paragraph 10) Even though there were many who did not participate in the ban of cars in Paris, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. (paragraph 14) Not only did this effort of less car usgae reduce congestion but it also reduced the level of smog in the France.

For many people cars are just an excuse not to exercise. For example, someone might say "Why should I walk when i can drive?" or "Why should I bike when I could take a taxi?" People are so busy and caught up in work and being the best over everyone that exercise and physical condition are the least of their worries when really, it should be at the top of their list of importance. If someone decides to walk or skate to work everyday they would be in a healthy state of being and not have to worry or stress about finding extra time after work or school to exercise. If car usage is limited, our community would be drastically more healthy, physically and mentally.

The amount of car usage has a great affect on many things in our community and our world. Car usage affects not only the pollution in our living conditions but also our mood and for some people, their happiness and stress level. The limited amount of cars also forces us to seek different forms of transportation that are not all motorized. Without cars people sometimes choose to walk, bike, skate, or even run to where they need to be. Not only does this improve our pollution problem but it also improves our physical and mental health. Limited car usage has many advantages and could make a very positive impact on our world.
