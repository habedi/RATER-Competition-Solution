Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing. The real concern is if this system of learning will actually take effect. There's many benefits to this if we think about it. Benefits like the students being able to work from the comfort of their own home and feel safe, adjusts their schedules if need be, and still be able to learn on the go. Though there's also a percentage of kids that can still manage to slack in online school.

Students being able to feel more safe and work efficiently in the comfort of their own household is a major pro in a case scenario like this. Think about it. Schools (whether it's public or private) tend to get rowdy at times. Stuff like constant fights, bickering between students and teachers, bullying, etc. takes a toll on those who aren't even involved. There has been one too many times where i've been disrupted in my learning environment or simply didn't want to deal with the negative aura around me and felt like switching to online school. Sometimes it isn't even because of a noisy area, it can also be because of bullying like i've stated before. Kids who are being picked on and teased at usually skip school or avoid certain classes to not face these kinds of issues which leaves them to fall back on work. As for another thing, social anxiety exists so those who aren't able to work with others or present in front of the class can consider online classes.

Adjusting to schedules is something really helpful. This is more directed towards middle schoolers and high schoolers because we get up way early than elementary and preschoolers. There's been a good amount of complaints through my sixth to eleventh grade years to know that waking up early and finishing work early in class but having to sit for another hour before dismissing is not something we want. I have a couple of friends who partake in online school that've told me they finish their work on their own time as long as it's done before it's due. So for instance, let's imagine i'm in online school. If i'm more of an afternoon person and can get stuff done faster around that time period plus able to think more clearly because i'm awake then i'll do it around that time.

Learning on the go is the last benefit on my list even though there's more. If you were to go out of town for vacation, funeral or whatever then you can always access your classes from the click of a button on your device. This can make your attendance record look good as well by not missing any work or skipping out on a day. Some may not take the opportunity and just skip on a few learning days instead which brings in the " there's a percentage of kids that can still manage to slack in online school" argument.

When it comes to the schooling system, I believe every student should have an opportunity to learn however they please whether it's online or not. Same benefits a public or private school has, is the same with home schooling but just online.
