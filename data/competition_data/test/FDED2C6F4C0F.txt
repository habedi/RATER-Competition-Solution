Dear Principal,

The school's cell phone policy should indeed be changed from the original policy to Policy 1. Children are stubborn, but nobody likes getting into trouble at school. Letting students use their cell phones during passing periods or lunch will give them a better attitude during their classes and one less thing they could get into trouble because of.

Some kids have significant others or close friends at other schools. The children in that category enjoy speaking with the people more meaningful to them even if it is during school hours. These people most likely put them in a better mood, so their attitude is to be expected to improve. With a better attitude during class will also improve students participation levels and grades.

Most kids get into trouble often for texting in class, but who wants to be in trouble? Kids from the junior high level to high school level will in fact bring their cell phones into school whether it is against the rules or not. Not every kid in America loves going to school and learning, so the children who don't, try to escape from class without exiting the room.

Let us use our phones during certain times
