I would be agaisnt it, because the person does not have controll of the car. I know its says the car hardly has a accident. The car is still dangerous though because the person does'nt have controll the full time. A person should be driving a car not a computer.

The person can take controll of the car yes but what if the driver falls asleep while the car is driving its self. Some people work very hard at work and is tired after a long day of work. Another thing what if someone walks out in front of you.

The positive thing about getting these car is its a better public transpertation. The inside is more flexible then a bus. The car uses half the fuel that the cars we drive around now does.

Ok not gonna try and sound paranoid here but what if someone hacked the car so that they could make it crash into something or someone. That would help hackers who murder people easy for them. These cars are not safe I dont think we need them.

People have been driving themselfs around for years now I think it should stay that way. These are just my opinions though nothing more. If we get them we get them.
