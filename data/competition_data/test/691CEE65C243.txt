Imagine being stressed everyday because you have to go to an activity that you hate. Then your parents are stressed because they have to get you there but you don't want to go. Plus you have more activities out of school that you have to go to after. A principle is trying to force his students to take at least one extracurricular activity.

I disagree with the statement. There are many reasons that a child may not want to or be able to do a school activity. The students could already be in activity outside of school. There may not be an activity that all students have an interest in. Plus in certain conditions some students may not have a way of transportation to the activity.

Some students may be going something outside of school. Like me, they could be on a sports team. The school may not offer a sports team at the level they are at. Some students could do martial arts. I don't think I have ever heard of a school that offers martial arts. A student could be on the swim team. Most public schools at least that I know of do not have swimming pools. Kids may already be doing and activity outside of school.

There may not be activities that all students enjoy. Certain students have certain interests. It is almost impossible to have an activity that every student will enjoy. A student could have an interest that only that one student has. Then they would be in a club that's just them. Students aren't going to want to go to an activity that doesn't interest them. Parents are going to have an even harder time getting their kids out the door to go.

Every student is different.

In certain situations students may not have the ability to go to an activity. A students may have just moved and they live farther away. They may not be able to drive back and forth. Maybe a students parents are divorced and they have to go to the other parents house. That parent may not be able to get them to the activity or pick them back up from it. Their parents might get home late and all they want to do is spend time with their kid. They don't want to worry about having a club to get to. Some situations are better without a club to worry about.

I disagree that it is a good decision to have all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students might be participating in an outside of school activity. There are some students who arent going to have an interest in any of the clubs that the school produces. There could be certain situations where clubs may make things more stressful than they have to be. I think that the students and the parents should get to choose if they should sign up for a club or activity.
