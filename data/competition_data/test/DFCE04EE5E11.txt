Everyone loves summer break, specially students. They get about 2 and half months to go out do activities that they couldn't do when the school is running. There are many outdoors and indoors activities that students engage in during summer break some of outdoors activities are going to beach, pool, and many other places. Some indoors activities are learning new skills, working on projects, talking extra online classes etc. Engaging in all these activities might lead to students not wanting to learn and go back to school. Which is why some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I think these summer projects should be teacher-designed because teacher can give students with projects that will help them when they come back to school, students can figure out if they like that class or not, and it will keep students in right track.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teacher can give students projects that will help them when they come back because teacher will teach them that subject in their next school year. When I was going to 9th grade we got to choose if we want to do summer projects or not. Most of us chose not to do the summer projects, instead we did not even look at any study materials during our break. There were few people in my class who did do their projects. The people who did their projects were able to answer all the questions asked by the teacher on topics that weren't taught to us. The students were able to answer the question because they were supposed to look up information and learn about that topic in the project. This shows that teacher-designed projects are better because teacher can make them study topics that they would need next year.

Teacher-designed summer projects are better than student-designed summer projects because students will not struggle in class. This is because summer projects designed by teacher allows students to learn and figure out their weakness in a particular area of that subject which also allows them to figure out if that subject is for them or not. For example, in my AP Computer Science class in 10th grade people didn't do their summer assignment because the teacher said she would not grade it. From the very beginning there were only few people who knew what was going on in class, rest of the students had no clue of what was happening because they were not interested in Computer Science, they would have known weatherÂ they are interested or not only if they had done the summer projects. Having summer projects and doing it helps students know what to expect from the class they are taking and weather to drop out before the school start or to continue with the class.

Summer project are good to keep students in track for next school year, and it is better if that summer project is designed by teacher. When students design their own project then they could choose things that are easy. Working on easy projects during summer break will take students off track for next school year. If a student designed a project where they have to sleep and watch TV, they will loose track of their sense and responsibility as a student. It would make them not wanting to go back to school. Once, one student didn't come to school a whole month after summer break because he was in love with his summer holidays and didn't wanted to come back to school. If he had summer project that he worked on during his summer break then he would not go off track.

Some may argue that teacher-designed projects are hard for students, and students should be allowed to whatever they want during their break. They are not completely wrong that teacher-designed projects are hard, but teacher designed projects are hard so that the student can do good in class next year. If a student thinks that summer project is hard for them, then that means the class that student will be taking is not for that student and should change the class. Teacher-designed summer assignment allows student to test their limit, allows student to be prepared, and will keep student in right track.
