The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuabe because teachers really cant tell weather all students are confused, bored,happy or sad. Also some people cant express there emotions like others can or some people can't always read another person's emotion.

Classroom's are full of students so teacher's cant tell wheather a student's is bored, or confused with a lesson so if the tecnology was valuable the lesson could be changed in the text it state's "A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts."Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." So if classrooms had this tecnology it would be slightly better for students to learn without being bored or confused.

Some people cant acually tell how other emotion's are they might be having trouble for instance in the text it states "you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course most of us would have trouble accually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc." This tell's you how some people have trouble figuring out a person trait and its not easy for many people to tell how your feeling. so its hard for a teacher to know how a class full of student's are feeling about each topic bacause some might not want to tell that they dont understand something or get the topic beacause many people don't like to express there emotion's.

With the use of the technology that reads the emotional expression's of student's in a classroom it would be easier for student's to learn better because and to understand because the tecnology would know that one student is confused or another is bored because it was to easy for them so with the technology being valuable it would be easy for most student's.
