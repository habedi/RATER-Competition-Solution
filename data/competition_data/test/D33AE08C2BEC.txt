Cell Phone Policy

Dear Whom It May Concern,

Not allowing kids to have phones out at school it the best option.

Not having the phones would mean that they could focus more in class and not be distracted so much.

Kids would be involved with more drama if phones were allowed at school.

Inappropriate text messages and pictures could be sent while at the school, via cell phone, and most parents would not like their children to be involved with this.

One reason phones should not be allowed at school is distractions.

Kids already get distracted very easily and don't pay attention in class.

With the phones, they wouldn't pay attention any more than they already did.

They would be too busy texting or on the phone with someone than to be studying for a test, or finishing homework.

Another reason phones should not be allowed is more drama would be started.

Rumors start drama, and no one likes drama.

Rumors are mainly started by texting, and with phones kids would have the opportunity to text and spread rumors more than they do without them.

Drama can cause conflicts between teachers and students, students and parents, parents and teachers, and students and students.

The last reason phones should not be allowed is they are not necessary.

Now kids aren't allowed to have phones and some choose to not obey the rules.

If caught, they are punished for not obeying the school rules.

Kids can fully function without their phone in their hands the whole time.

Obviously since phones aren't allowed now and children can talk to each other and carry on their social lives, there is no point in having them at school.

No phones at school is the best decision there is.

Although some kids may need music to study or work to their fullest extent, they can do that home.

Phones can cause so many problems between people, and no one wants to bring that into the school. The policy on no phones allowed at school should stay the way it is.
