I believe that the so called face is just a natural landform. It is just a mountain with shadows that create an illusion of a face. In the very first picture of this landform it was very blurry, now cameras has evolved so now it is clear.

NASA wanted to figure out if this was a ancient face or an regular landform. So , 22 years later NASA went back to Mars to figure out what this landform is. With the technology NASA have they took pictures of the landform and they found out it was just a regular landform.

NASA wanted to do a double-check so in 2001 they took some more pictures. Now the pictures came out more clear than the last picture in 1998. Then NASA proved once again that it was just a natural landform.

Those are the reasons why that it is a natural landform. It was proved twice and the pictures were accurate, 3 times better the vision the last time they took a photo. Even with all the evidence some still believe that it is an acient Egyptian pharoh face on Mars.
