Diverless cars sounds like a fantastic idea for the future, but not now. We are developing and avancing in technology to fast. Which can led, to many errors in our technology. In the coulpe years technology has becomed our need to survive for some people. Adults are growing children with technolgy, for example computers, phones, iPads, etc. Well, my position on driverless cars is that they are a smart and wonderful invention for the future because the cars sound more reliable and safe, but

I feel like it is just not the right time for driverless cars to be introduced in four years. I am still trying to catch up with all the new avanced things that are bing invented each day.

The idea of driveless cars sounds really cool because the car can drive for you, without you needing to drive. And that it involves a heads up display by turning off instantly when the driver needs to take over. Therefore, it makes it safe to travel in driveless cars because safety is a huge concern. That means there should always be a driver, who can drive to remain alert. It is also cool how the driver watches the road and the car watches the driver. I cannot wait for driveless cars to come out.

It seems like the ficitional movies were correct that by 2020 technology will change and do a huge impact on the world. Hopefully, we don't loss the track of time. And don't develop technology really fast that we can be disspointed in the future.
