People all over the world love to do extracurricular activities;so why not students. I agree with that student should do an extracurricular activities. First, I think that if students do sports they will get healthier. Second, I think that if students work in a play the students would be more responsible. Third, I think that if students serve on the student council the students would be more mature. In all, a extracurricular activity would be good for everyone.

First of all, If students do sports the student would get more healthier. When people do a sport they begin to lose weight. Students like sports because it build up your muscle to do stuff like pick up heavy things you couldnÃÂ´t pick up before. Another reason students like sport is it helps you build up confidence. All in all, sports help kids in a lot of ways like get strong muscles, get confidence and get you healthier.

Next, the students who work in the play are really respnsible. I think that because they have to remember hard line. The actors also have to remember their costumes and to do their makeup in a short amount of time. The backstage crew has to remember the piece of set goes on to the stage. Overall, students who are in the play really have to be responsible.

Lastly, students who serve the student council are mature. The students in the student council have to be trustworthy. Also the students have to be good in school like the donÃÂ´t get sent out of class and have straight AÃÂ´s. So the students need to be respectful and kind. All in all, the students in the student council need to be mature.

In, conclusion, students need extracurricular activities like sports,plays, and to be on the student councils. The extracurricular activities make you strong and independent. They also help you to be healthy and confident. I think student really nee extracurricular activities. That is what I think about extracurricular activites.
