Dear Principal,

Many of the students, including myself, feel that you should allow students with a C average to participate in sports. Because many of the athletes on the teams have only a C average. Now some of them might have higher scores but the ones who don't shouldn't be kicked out of the activities they like. Some students are not as smart academically as they are good physically. But we the students feel that as long as they are smart enough to get a C average than they should be allowed to participate in sports. If you approve the new policy, odds are we wont have any sports teams anymore and the ones we do have will be very small. Our teams are mostly made up of C average students.

I feel the reason that is, is because many of the smarter students are more interested in science, history, reading, etc. That may not be the case for everyone but for the most part it is true. If you were to pass the policy there would be a huge outrage within the student body system. And many of the athletes that are C average, would go to other places to play sports. And I know from personal experience that it costs money to partake in sports. You must pay for the jerseys and the coach and ref fees. So if you made that policy then the school would be losing money.

Although those two reasons are fairly good reasons I think, there is another reason that I feel is the best reason of all. My main reason for going against this policy is, think about the students. Most of them do not like school and that is why they are getting a C average. And participating in sports makes them actually want to go to school so they can enjoy the sports. And if you stop allowing the C average kids in sports, then all of those kids will lose all interest is school. They will stop caring and trying. I feel that as a principal it is your job to want the best for our kids. And that in turn means that you want them to try their hardest and do well. But if you take away their reason to try, they will take away the effort. It may cost more, or be harder to let all the students in, but I feel and you should hopefully feel that the cost is worth it if it gives the kids hope, fun, and a reason to try.

That alone is enough of a reason I feel, not to put that new policy into action. But if you feel that those reasons aren't good enough, then put that new policy into action and then look at the student's grades and efforts at school. And then you can see how they would probably have dropped tremendously. Because they have to reason to try if they get nothing good or fun out of it. And you can also look at all of our past trophies and awards and think about how we won't get many more because all of our good players got kicked off. So if you decide to pass it, I hope you can work the other problems that come from it out, and if you decide, to listen to this advice and take this all into consideration, and decide not to pass it. Then I can almost guarantee that our football teams, track teams, baseball teams, basketball, softball, lacrosse, water polo, and soccer teams will all thank you for it. Because you give them reasons to try in school. Which also means they'll try during a game.

Which will bring our school honor, respect, dignity, and most importantly it will bring us closer together as a group. So we can all stop arguing and fighting and help improve our schools, communties, towns, and cities.

I hope I have given you some things to think about. Thank you for your time. I hope this helps you make the right decision.

Sincerely,

The student body of SCHOOL_NAME
