In the story "The Challenge of Exploring Venus". The Uthor talks about the dangers in Venus and why it is not a safe place to land on. He also states the benefits of traveling to Venus, and why going to Venus is a risk worth taking

The Author states that Venus was once like planet earth, That it held Oceans, Mountains, and Craters. According to The Challenge of Exploing Venus, "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 4). In other words Venus held some sort of life at some bpoint it also had water which could help us if one day our Earth comes to and end. Furthermore, The Author also mentions that Venus is the nearest planet in case of an emergency. According to The Challenge of Exploring Venus, "Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"(The Challenge of Exloring Venus 4). Finally the Author mentions out technology and how Scientists have made new simplified electronics made of Silicon carbide that have lasted up to 3 weeks in Venus's conditions. According to The Challenge of Exploring Venus, "some simplified technology made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This means that we eventually would be able to visit Venus's surface without dying within a few hours, which woud help us learn way more about teh planet.

To conclude, traveling to venus is dangerous but with the amount of information we know and the amount of technology we have we will be able to surface Venus once and for all. Venus holds a lot of things that will benefit our lives.
