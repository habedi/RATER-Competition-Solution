I agree that students should participate in 1 or more extracurricular activity because it can work on their teamwork skills,get them exirsize, and let them do something other than work for a little. They don't have to actally do what they dont want .If they don't want to pay soccer and they want to clean up they have that choice but there will be groups and they might not always get what group they want. If they get outside and play sports or even pick up trash from outside it can help our community. All of these students want to do is be on a computer or a phone and doing these activities can help them be use to being of of these electronics.

I think the students should also have a say in what activities they should do because people don't like doing things they don't injoy. We could play sports, pick up trash from the football fields, work on their homework if they are behind,and walk the track. They are so much more we can do to get these students doing. I think don't think it's good for students to be just doing work all day until 3:00 half way throuhgh the day they need to be doing something relaxing or something that's getting their mind of of work for maybe just 20 or 30 mins a day.

So I do agree and think that all students should participate in 1 or more exrtacurricular acttivity a day. Do you?
