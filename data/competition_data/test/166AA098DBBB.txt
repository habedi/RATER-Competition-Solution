Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Should the children at SCHOOL_NAME be required to perform community service?

No! In my opinion I do not think the children should be required to do so.

One, because we the children of SCHOOL_NAME are given lots of homework on a daily basis. Two, because lots of children at SCHOOL_NAME are involved with sports, clubs, and other after school activities so we wouldn't have time.

Homework counts as a grade and not doing it counts off and brings a students grade down, so if we don't have time to do it because we are doing community service we won't have a good grade in that class. Why as a principle would you want that? Granted I do think community service is important just don't force the children to do it. Just because other students have extra time on there hands and like to do community service doesn't mean other students want to.

Basketball, Football, Soccer, etc... these are all examples of things kids do after school also there are academic clubs, and tutoring that go on after school, so by doing community service the children would not have time to do sports or clubs which are fun and you can make good friends in a safe and controlled learning environment. So TEACHER_NAME please do not require the students of SCHOOL_NAME to do community service.

Please and Thank you.

Sincerely,

The Student Body of SCHOOL_NAME Middle School
