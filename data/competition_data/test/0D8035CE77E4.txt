Dear principal,

You are trying to decide which policy that you should apply in school. The first policy allows students to bring their phones to school and use it during lunch or free times. I think that this policy should not be applied to the school. Instead, you should apply policy 2 which students are not allowed to bring their cell phones at school at all. I agree with policy 2 because when the students phone rings during class, it distracts students from learning and teachers from teaching. Also, if you allow students to bring their phones to school and they use their phones to cheat on tests by texting other students.

Students carry their cell phones to school.

We understand that they need their phones for emergency. However, cell phones are becoming a big distraction to the class. This distracts the class because when the phone rings, all students give their attention to the phone that is ringing. Yesterday, my friend forgot to turn of his phone so when his phone rang, everyone started laughing about the ring tone so, it distracted everyone in my class. Also, when the phone rings, it stops the teacher from teaching the class. My teacher is teaching us in a fast pace because we have the annual C.M.T tests in 2 weeks. But, when the a students phone rang, the teacher had waste his time trying to take the students phone because the student doesn't want to give his phone to the him. In addition, by the time my teacher took the phone away from him, the class ended and we barely learn the important subjects.

Here are some reasons and examples why students shouldn't bring their phones to school. When their are tests, the student doesn't give all of their effort. Instead, they cheat on their test. The worst thing about that is they use their phone to contact another student and help them cheat on their test. They do this by secretly texting each other. When they text, they give each other the answer to the test. This is wrong so this is why cell phones should be banned from school.

In summation, the reason why phones shouldn't be allowed in school is that it distracts the class and students use it to cheat on test. If you still feel that policy 1 should be applied in the school, then you made a
