I fell that students should still be able to participate in school activities with an grade C average. I fell this way because there are student who do not pick up work as quickly as others, and do try very hard to get their work done on time ,and works hard in class to reach the standards. Even thought many try they still lack behind on learning new things and need extra help on picking up the work.

I think it would be a better consideration if instead of banding these students away from participating in these school events they start programs to help them get help in the subjects they are not doing their best in. For example starting a Saturday school program and make sure all students that want to be apart of these activities participate in this as well, and are showing improvement should be able to be apart of these events sinc
