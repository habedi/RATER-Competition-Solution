Summer has always been seen as the well deserved break from school that students deserve. However, for many advanced placement students, summer can be filled with projects and homework to prepare them for their rigorous courses. These rigorous courses can be honors, advanced placement, or dual enrollment classes offered by the school district. Summer homework has become the distinction between academic and higher education options. The question remains, is summer homework more beneficial when it is designed by a teacher or by a student. Although students have the advantage since they took the course themselves while the teachers seldom take part of the tests or classwork, teachers would be better equipped in making summer enrichment projects because teacher are far more educated, have made many projects for students in the past, and have most likely taught the course in the past. These reason showcase why teachers are better at making projects for the summer than students are.

It is a fact that teachers are more educated than students are. Teachers have completed years of college to be able to teach in a classroom. Students have not even complete high school compared to the numerous years of education teacher had to go through. Teachers also have to go through a apprenticeship and learn from a teacher after they achieved their college education. During this apprenticeship, many teachers watch and learn as older teachers show them how to make a project that can be best suited for their classroom. This amount of work makes educators more than capable of handling making a summer project for students. Students are not as educated as teacher are. Teachers went to college to learn and be able to educate. Their education makes them more than qualified to make and grade summer projects that they assign to students. While many students have no idea where to start in terms of making a project, America's educators have been learning these skill for generations. These reasons on education are why teachers are more qualified to make summer enrichment homework than high school students.

Many teachers also have years of experience making projects for students to complete. Teacher across America have been making projects for students to complete for years. Projects arent new and teachers have been making and assigning them since day one. While many students have not once made a project for multiple peers, teachers have been making assignments and projects for years. Education alone should make teachers a far more appealing group to develop and assign projects and summer work for students to complete to understand the course. This amount of practice comes from their education and their time as teachers. Many students have no experience at all with developing and making assignments, this is a teachers job. This is why that experience alone and be the factor why teachers are more qualified to making summer projects than students are.

Also many teachers, have taught the same class or at least the same type of class. Many classes, such as the advanced placement classes, have included the same teacher for most of their careers. This is the most important factor. Since teachers have been educating in the same fields and classes for the majority of their career, they know the material and curriculum of the class. This, opposed to a student who mostly likely only spent a school year in the class, makes educator qualified to be able to assign and grade summer projects. Students merely have attended the class for only a school year while it is apart of a teachers job to understand and master the curriculum of the course. Teachers know what is on the tests and what you need to know to be successful in the class. This is why teachers are far better at making summer projects than students.

While many teachers have taught the courses, the students are the ones taking them. Students are the ones who have to study and do homework for hours and sometimes the information is not relevant for the exam. Teachers have not had the same point of view as students have today. Students at the end of the year know what they need to know to be successful in making summer projects and assignments. Although these are very valid points, they do not account for how qualified teachers are. As already mentioned, teachers have gone trough years of education, teaching the same class, and experience of making projects. Between students, who no little about the course compared to teachers, and educators, who spent years to be the best teacher they can be, teachers are far better at making summer enrichment projects. Many students are ill-equipped and ill-advised on making summer projects for them and their peers to complete and have a basic idea of the course itself.

Teacher are more qualified to make summer project because of their extensive education and apprenticeship, their time making projects in the past, and time spent learning and mastering the course. These reasons, among many others, showcase way teacher are the best at making summer assignments and projects for honor students across high school in America. Although students have the point of view of seeing and participating in lessons, taking the tests and exams, and doing the classwork and assignments, it is not comparable to the advantage that many teachers have when education students. At the end of the day, teachers are the best to plan and make summer projects that can prepare students for their upcoming class. It is up to the teachers to teach and the students to learn the topic of the course.
