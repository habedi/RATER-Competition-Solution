To the principle:

I agree on how all students should help community service, even thought it may take much time it will make a big change upon the school. Such as the school wont be dirty and have trash all over the school grounds. It will also help the environment so no pollution will be caused by that area. Although the school on the outside may look nice but what about the inside? You may be thinking, all the schools on the inside looks perfectly nice and clean, but some schools or even neighborhoods have trash and pollution all around it.

All students should go in a extracurricular activity to help clean the inside of the schools, such as cleaning the lockers, erase graffiti that are on the bathroom walls, or just even cleaning out the desks, it will be a much better help if they go and help the community outside of school grounds. In fact they can pick up littler off of the ground around their neighborhoods, recycle plastic bottles, or cleaning their house and rooms. its not much to say, just a little hard work and bam, your community is all good and looks new.

Some friends might think, "Hey man, I know that you like helping the world but face it bro, there are plenty of other people helping the world, lets just go to the mall." then tell them this. "If you think there are so many people in the world helping the world and their community, or even their schools then how come nobody has been helping out? Every single person causes damage to the schools and community, such as going to the mall, you cant walk so you take a car, and the car blows out gas which causes air pollution. and people litter everyday without them knowing. even breathing causes air pollution, not like someone is telling you not to breathe but would you want to live in a world where the environment is horrible and the schools have trash all over the floor and grass, also have graffiti all over the place?

I know i don't, so that's why we make the world a better place by recycling and cleaning up the schools and the environment.
