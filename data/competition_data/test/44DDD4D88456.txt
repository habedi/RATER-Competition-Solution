A project during summer vacation! summer vacation was suppose to be about having fun not doing boring old school work. Some schools require students to do projects over the summer. While some may say that the projects should be teacher designed, because the teachers know what they want the students to learn about. The summer projects given to students should be designed by no other than the students themselves. Students designing projects themselves will lead to many positive things, first students will actually do these summer projects, secondly they will be more engaged to what they are learning from this project, and lastly they will learn more about what they like personally.

To start off, if their summer projects were designed by students they would actuallly do them. Alot of times when the teacher assigns a project many students won't turn that project in at all. This results in conflicts such as bad grades. Most times students don't do these projects because they are not intrested in them. Summer is on of the biggest breaks students get from school, so why would they wanna spend it doing projects for school that are boring. Students share intrests, so if a student were to design a project that was educational but in common intrests of those around them. The other students would actually do this project because it's something they like.

They may even come up with partner projects that will help with students social skills. This Allows them to open up about things they don't understand about projects when they are in the class room.

Secondly, student designed projects will allow students to be more engaged in their projects. There is no kid anywhere in the world you can get to engage in something they don't like or want to do, unless you force them to do it. Well same goes for summer projects if a student doesn't want to do it they will not be engaged in it. Not engaging in things such as projects can lead to sloppy, messed up, and badly graded work.

This doesn't allow students to show teachers what they are really able to do. Other students know what their fellow peers strong point and weaknesses are. They can design fun and intriuging way to learn but also have fun while doing their summer project. When they do design fun projects like this it will let these students become engaged in what they are learning.

Finallly, student designed projects will allow the student body to learn more about their intrests personally. The whole point of school is to learn about the world and learning skills we will need when we grow up. Along the way you will learn youe strong points and your weaknesses. You figure out what you like and don't like doing. Taking your strong points and intrests to poin you in the direction you should go in. A project that's student designed for their own personally intrests will allow them to grow. They will learn all they can because that project will be something fun and engaging about something they want to know more about personally. This will let them flourish in the field they want to learn about.

In conclusion, Schools requiring students to do summer projects should let the projects be student designed. Students know what their peers want to know about. These projects will be more student based so they will actually do them. Activities they want to learn about is where you will find the students to be more engaged. When projects are designed by students it will be about topics they themselves are intrested in, allowing them to learn more about these topics. Students should design required summer projects because they are the ones doing the projects.
