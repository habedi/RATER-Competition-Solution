Dear Principal,

I recommend policy one to be allowed, to have use of cell phones only in lunch and free time periods because if student now don't have that privilege they are force to sneak texting. Not only are they sneaking texting but some students call parents and friends in bathrooms and locker room. So either way student are using there cellular devices anyway. It will also reduce the detentions and any other consequences that the school haves to make kids learn there lessons. So if you actually think about it you are teaching the kids more because there are no interruptions on taking away a cell phone or punishments there for there is more time on teaching then yelling punishing and interrupting in the class rooms environment. Also it is possible that the students behavior will increase because they have a little leeway. But if the policy dose not work you can just end up switching the rule to policy two and punishing the students that way and if you are nice enough if the students behavior changes then you can either give them another chance or say you blowed it so now you have to suffer with no cell phones what so ever. That's why i think policy one is better.

senilely, STUDENT_NAME
