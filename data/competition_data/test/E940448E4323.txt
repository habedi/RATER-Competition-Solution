Well i think students should do community service because it will keep their mind active. Also they will be focus on there work in school and in the service. If a student does not do community service they will not focus on there work and they will be playing all the time. For example if a student does community service they will be focusing on the work and not play, they will also concentrate on homework. When a student does not do community service they will not focus on there work that they will have to do. The students that don't do community service will almost be playing outside with their friends and not the work they are suppose to do. If a student does not want to do community service then maybe they have an after school program that helps them.

When you do community service you don't have to do it all day some of the community services have a time to see how long you can stay. Also you can decide whether to help on weekdays or weekends so that you have time for school work. If you do help your community with like picking up litter, helping kids, or others then your community will look like a nice place for everyone.

When you don't help your community like help cleaning trash then your community will look like a dirty place to live in.

If you don't want to do community service then its up to you if you want do it. If you decide not do it then maybe you have an after school program that helps you with things you need done in school.
