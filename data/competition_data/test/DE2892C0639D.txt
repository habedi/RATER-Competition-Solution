Summer break is one of the many joys of being a student. The sunny weather, the vacations, and most importantly, the break from school. However, there are many schools that require their students to continue their studies over summer break by completing a project. Considering this, it is clear that it would be most beneficial for students to have the opportunity to chose the nature of their own projects, rather than being assigned one. This is because if students are able to choose a subject that they are personally interested in, they would be more willing to learn and do the work assigned to them. It would also allow them to spend their summer break working on something they enjoy learning about.

To begin with, students would learn more if they were allowed to choose their own topic. This is because they would be more willing to do research and spend time on said project during their break, since they would enjoy themselves. If they were assigned a topic by their teacher in which they had no interest in, they would be less likely to put in effort and complete it. Thus, students having the freedom to choose their own topics for summer projects would allow more room for their education.

To continue, if students had the option to choose their own topics for summer projects and assignments, they would be able to spend their summer break on something that they enjoy learning about. The reason for summer break is so that students have an opportunity to wind down and get away from the stress that comes with schoolwork. If they were forced to complete a project in which they had no interest in, they would again be stressed and not enjoy their summer break. Therefore, students would enjoy themselves more by working on an assignment that they have an interest in.

Despite this, many say that without a clear topic for a summer assignment, students would be more likely to be confused on where to begin, and would not learn about significant school subjects. While this could ring true for some students, it does not apply to the majority. All students have unique interests and viewpoints, which would be evident in their own individual projects. If given the opportunity, students could shine in a way that would not be possible with a teacher-assigned topic for a project. This shows that, again, students having the opportunity to choose their own topics for summer assignments would be extremely beneficial for them, much more than if a topic were chosen by a teacher.

In conclusion, students would benefit more from summer assignments if they chose individual, unique topics, since they would be more willing to learn and educate themselves. They would also enjoy their summer breaks this way. They would put in more work and research into their projects, and simultaneously enjoy both themselves and their summer break before school starts again. Students deserve the chance to appreciate and soak in the summer sun while being stress free.Â
