Everyone likes to do things in their own way. You like to have control of certain things and you want to do it in a certain way. In Subway, for example, you like to build your own sandwich and put all the toppings you like. You get to choose if you want turkey or ham, olives or tomatoes, or maybe you just want a slice of thin bread and cheese. Just like how you like to build your own sandwiches and food, summer projects should be student-designed. If students were to design their own projects, they would learn more efficiently and have an opportunity to showcase their creativity.

We as a society value creativity and uniqueness. They are qualities that are taught and promoted in our schools and communities. Therefore, summer projects should be student-oriented because they can showcase their creativeness and their own ideas. Students will have the opportunity to show how they think and their originality. As a student, I like when Ms. Generic_Name gives the class a project to do. All Ms. Generic_Name does is give us a topic and tells us to write an essay, do a PowerPoint, or a poster. We get many options, there are no barriers as to what we can do. She says she wants to see our thinking process and wants us to be interested in what we do. If we get to design our projects we will be much more interested in completing it, whereas if it was teacher-designed we would be indifferent towards it. We are not robots or computers that simply do things all the same. We are humans with different ideas and thoughts. That's why you may tackle a problem differently than I would. Thats why summer projects should be student-designed, so we can show our teachers our different ideas and thoughts.

I hate it when a teacher tells us to do our notes in a certain way. If we take notes, its so they can help us study and review. Each person has their own way of learning, so our notes are not always going to be the same. As Ms. Generic_Name says, " Your notes, your way." Meaning that taking notes will not benefit her but it will benefit us. So we should take notes our own way. With projects it is the exact same thing. If we get teacher-designed projects, we may not really learn the material and the whole thing will have been for nothing. A teacher is not going to think how a student thinks. The whole purpose of giving students summer assignments is so we can continue learning during our break. But how can we learn efficiently if we are not given the opportunity to do things our way. If we do get to design our projects we will be interested in the topic we are given and do our research with enthusiasm. We tend to do better in things we are interested in and things we are good at.

Many can argue that it is better if the projects assigned should be teacher-designed because it shows students capacity to follow tasks. They also say that it prepares them for future jobs where they may need to do an assignment the way their supervisor tells them to do. But thought our entire school lives we've been doing projects and assignments that are designed by teachers. Therefore, in the summer, students should be able to show their skills and creativity. Being original is an attribute that companies also look for in employees, not just the ability to follow tasks. By allowing students to design their own projects, teachers are better preparing them for the future and their careers.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be student-designed. If we get to design our projects we will be able to show our creativity and our way of thinking to teachers. We will also show more interest in our project and puts lots of effort. And of course we will learn more efficiently if we get to design our projects. It is more beneficial if students were to design their projects instead of the projects being designed by a teacher. Just like how you like to do things a certain way, we students should be able to design the summer assignments.
