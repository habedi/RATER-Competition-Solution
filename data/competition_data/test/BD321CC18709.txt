Mostly everyone is aware of the so called "global warming" and air pollution issues we have going on around the world. Both of those are mainly caused by motor vehicles that we use on a dialey basis. Lately places around the world, like Paris and China, have been trying their very best to limit the percentages of these and the pollutant in the air by banning cars for one or more days and having citizens rely on taxis, buses, walking, bikes, etc.

Because of this, scientists have already began to prove that the percentage of air pollutant has gone down, not drastically but there is at least 9% less, which is still improvment. Less air pollutant also means healthier citizens, which is what these countries are mainly aiming for in this experiment which they call "smart planning".  They began this study in cities to make them less denser and better for walking, now they have move their plan over to the suburbs.

In Paris they banned all vehicles with even number plates for the day and vehicles with odd numbered plates the next. Violators were fined a 22-euro($31) ticket. In Vaubban, Germany they have asked people the gove up cars and the roads a "car-free" zone, excpet for the tram and a few of the streets on the edge of the community. They also had large garages down at the egde of the community which were sold for $40,000 along with a house.

Studies have also shown that along with physical health, citizens ahve been happier and more "stress-free" when it comes to not driving. one mom in Vauban said it was nice the hear the swish of bicycles and chatter of children instead of the occasional distant motor. America was a step ahead of all these other coummunities though. Their number or cars and liscense that have been given a year has a decreased effincently and is almost the same as it was in 1995.
