Venus is very dangerous and volcanic but this article has opened my eyes to the woderful planet. Despite the dangers and challenges that Venus presents I would have to agree with the author, for we could one day benefit from knowing more about this red planet. Regardless of all the challenges that come with it, getting to know the surface and history of this close planet could better pevent ours from turning into a replica.

A couple of statements that fascinated me about Venus is that it has the hottest surface tempurature in our solar system with an average temperature of over 800 degrees Farenheit. That is truly mind-boggling seeing as how Mercury is the closest planet to our sun, not Venus. To make matters worse the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we expirence on Earth, therefore, making it very hard to explore the surface. Even just getting close to the surface you would have to deal with eruptions, earthquakes, and lightning strikes.

The risk is incredible but the information provided from this planet may very well save us all one day. As stated, Venus was the most Earth-like planet in our soar system meaning the same thing could happen to us eventually. Even though Venus could have substained life in the past, now is very unlikely. How could we find out more about this interesting planet if we cannot go near it?

As of right now, technologically speeking, we are far to inadvanced to send anything to the surface, let alone humans. The safest possibility to even get close would be to float in a structure roughly 30 miles above the surface. Even at that distance the temperature would still stand at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level.

In conclusion, I feel that if there was a way to study Venus close up without all the provided risks and more, then we should invest. Many great things could come from any planet alone but this one is just amazing. Do you think Venus is worth it?
