to the principal,

I think that you should change the policy to at least a grade c average, so more student can be in sports and that way the school can have more activity going on. I also think that all the students have a grade of D but they will change that to a C or more so they can be in sports or other activities. this students like to play and do activities i am not going to lied i have a grade C and i want to do some sport or activity but if you don't change the policy i think i just have to work harder than what i am doing.

most students get sad because they cant do sports because of their grade and some of them are my friends and i seen them change their grades up to an A

just for the sport and i think i will too but it will be a little easier for us if you just change it to a C average.

well that's what i think about that you should really listen to the student opinions about this policy well i have to go my time is almost up!!!

sincerely,
