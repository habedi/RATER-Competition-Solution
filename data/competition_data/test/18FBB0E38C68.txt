Dear Principal,

Hi I'm STUDENT_NAME here writing this letter to tell what I think about your new policy. This policy states that students are not allowed to play any type of sport without a B average. I totally disagree with this policy 100% , I think that students should be able to play any sport as long as they are passing their class by a C average but they should also be put on a warning stating that if their grade drops any lower they will be off that sport until their grades improve.

Fit activity such as sports so students can be able to stay active and fit.

By keeping all sports in our schools it will keep the students off of negative things and keep them on positive things. If we keep tutors and teachers helping the students to do better in their work I think that the students will understand how important it is to keep their grades up to play sports then we want have a problem with keeping all sports in schools. The warning will be great for students that play sports. It will show them that we are not playing with what we say about grades. As a student I can set the example for my fellow students making them want to do better in school too. So taking out sports are not really doing anything but making the situation worse and worse. Please take my idea in to consideration and i promise you want regret making this chose.

Thank you for taking the time to reading my opinion about what you should do with the dealing with this situation. I hope it approves in a nice orderly fashion.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
