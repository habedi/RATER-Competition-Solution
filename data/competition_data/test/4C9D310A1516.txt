As a person who loves to stay home, I can say they would not benefit off of this method of learning, some students may, but most would not. If students were taught at home they'd be able to goof around because they have free will and no teacher to tell them what to do, they'd be less focused because they have more distractions because they're at home with all the things they like. When taking a test it would just make cheating easier as the teacher may not be able to see the student. On the plus side there would be less arguing because if you get upset with the teacher you just mute them and turn off the camera, but then again that's another reason not to do this.

I think the only reason to do this would be if the student was sick, out of the country, or injured severely. How much sleep would the studen get when they are out of the country, because of the different time zone? Good part is they may get a better education doing this than in their own country, it prvoides students new opportunitys to learn more about themselves and the world, yet it's a terrible idea what happens when the connection is bad and the stundet doesn't know what's going on, then they're lost on evrything. If you think this is a good idea, show me and example how, a real life example, go and try to prove me wrong, not saying you can't just saying, try.
