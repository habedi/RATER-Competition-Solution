Dear principal,

I'm writing you this letter to inform you that students should not be required to do community service because not all kids have all the time in the world to pick up other peoples trash, and also because not all students want to be picking up trash because either they have stuff to do with their families at home or maybe friends, or because it is boring, and because there either in sports or a school club. I don't think students should be required to do community service because it is not there job to pick up liter from the city streets because there are more important things to do then that like doing homework, school work, or maybe they have a job or something but mainly because a lot of students do not want to community service, this is why I'm informing you that students should not be required to do community service during after school activities or clubs.

Sincerely,

Anonymous student
