Some school offer distance learning to attend classes from home, by way of online or video conferencing they think this is a good idea the students can learned if don't have to go to school they give, a solution the students can't go to school because they work all day thye give the chanse to state home I. think is not a good idea for somany reason examplo thy not going pay attention and other reason.

One of the reason they I think is not a good idea classes for internet, is the student not going to pay atention of the video hey do others staf like play games whit friends and look tv. I think is a bad idea to give classes for internet also some kids dosen't care classes, and this is the one of the reason they don't goo to schhol and give the excuse the school is to far away but is no't true.

The second reason is if the studen have a cuestion how they goin to answer the cuestion they have, if is no one to answer the cuestion they ahve also all the studen need differen way to explain. If they don't understand in one way they can undertand from other way, the video is not goin to explain to differen way and also they not goin to answer any cuestion they ahve it is better to came to school becaus, in is chool have somany teacher they cans aswer ani cuestionthey ahave.

Inconclution is not a good idea to classes for internet because kids cano't undertand, somani things it is better came to school and ask the cuestion they have and they have one answer and take care more of classes, and also they not goin to play when the teacher are explein and, can get better greades and bookgreats this is my position on classe from home because somany kids are not, responsible and maybie they don't remember they have classes on the computer this is my bigest reaso they I am not agree whit this progerct.
