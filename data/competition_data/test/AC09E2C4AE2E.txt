"Yayy!"

That is the sound of fun when you participate in school activities. Joining school clubs, or even sports has many benefits, that people may or may not know of. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you gain new friendships and it improves teamwork skills.

Extracurricular activities help you gain new friendships. Going into these clubs, classes, or sports people meet a variety of people. They get to meet and talk to different people who they might have the same interests with. Having those interests, he/she could slowly start a bonding, and those type of bonds eventually can turn into a friendship. For example, I joined orchestra in 4th grade, and I had an assigned seat next to this girl. We talked once or twice in class then we started seeing each other in the lunchroom, and hallways. We would always say hi or even wave at each other, through that we became friends and through that friendship she eventually became one of my very best friends. Gaining new friendships doesn't always have to start by bonding, or getting an assigned seat next to someone. It could also be congratulating them on their work because you felt like it looked brilliant. All in all, you can meet new people and gain new friends through extracurricular activities.

Joining these activities also helps improve teamwork skills. In any extracurricular activities people work together to accomplish the work needed. Working together as a group gets us to communicate, listen and share ideas which helps with teamwork skills. For example, when I did track last year we always had to work together as a group. Each individual learned from one another and built on their strengths and weaknesses in order to accomplish the goal needed. It isn't easy to work as a team, but extracurricular classes help through putting variety of people into a group for them to get to know each other and learn how built from the differences they have. Altogether, we can work on our team work skills through activities.

Since you can gain new friendships and improve teamwork skills, I agree that all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It is a great experience for anyone, even if you've never done an extracurricular activity. It brings you many benefits in life and as a person.Â
