Dear principal,

I think that performing community service is a good idea and it is very significant to do so. The reason why i say that performing community service is important and that it is a good idea is because it could teach the youth how to be more involved with their community and it could teach a valuable lesson to them. For example, picking up the trash off of the ground, could teach the youth that it causes less pollution and that it could be very generous of them to do so. pollution can mess up people's community and i know that the children wouldn't want that at all. Performing community service doesn't take up too much time. it could only take up a small portion of someone's time

Requiring this performance would help out the communities and would put smiles on everyone's faces. It could get children to be off of their electronics and other things that they value, and get a taste of learning and helping out their communities. I really think that it would brighten up people's lives and cause for people to be happy. Once all the cleaning up is done or whatever the topic is, is finished, children could go outside and play ride their bikes, jump rope, or anything they want to do. Helping out the community could cause a big improvement.

Do not just do this for me, but do it for those who want a better community and those who want to see a change. I think that you would be proud of those who want to volunteer and help out with the community services. I hope that with all of this in mind, you make the right decision because once you make your final decision, there is no turning back. You have to realize that being involved and helping out with your community is very important and special to me. I hope and pray that you choose wisely and understand those point of views who want to help out with and be involved with community service.

love your student,
