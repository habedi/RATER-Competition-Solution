In reality a student-designed summer project could never work. It would lead to the teacher grading several vastly different assignments about the same subject, and this is assuming all the students would even do their own project. A teacher-designed project is better because it is guaranteed to include all the material the students have learned and provide a properly structured assignment that reinforces what is learned in the classroom, while lowering a teacher's workload.

Teacher-Designed projects is a better idea, because they are guaranteed to include all material that has been taught during class. This is due to the fact that most teachers have a plan for what is taught each day and keep a record on a computer or physical calendar. Meanwhile, at the end of one unit most students will forget what is taught at the beginning of that same unit. At the same time the majority of students aren't organized, so any previous notes or assignments that could help a student create their own project have been lost.

Another reason is teacher-designed projects provide a properly structured assignment that reinforces what is taught in the classroom. It is only natural that the person who has extensive knowledge on the material and leads the class be the one to create the assignment. If a student were to make the assignment it would consist of simple questions with answers that can be looked up on Google. However, a teacher has the knowledge and experience to make the student use critical thinking skills and devise their own answers

The most important point is that it would be less work for a teacher to grade an assignment made by him/her.

Considering that most teachers have over two-hundred different students is baffling in of itself. Imagine taking an hour of your day to grade two-hundred of the same assignment with an answer key almost everyday. Now imagine grading two-hundred vastly different assignments with no answer key. Then add that to fact that school has started again which means even more assignments. This is just to much for one person to handle and could lead to mounds of stress.

Overall, a teacher-designed summer project would result in a better understanding of the subject and a teacher that isn't overwhelmed by the amount of assignments. Meanwhile, a student-designed project would leave everyone misinformed or with a zero on the project. Whoever came up with this idea needs to reevaluate how responsible they think teenagers are.
