I agree with the principal because of many reasons. If students have mostly a c average and they want to participate in sports they will try their best to pull their grades up so they can participate.

Many students like to play sports but many don't like to do any school work. So it would be a good idea to make the principal's idea into a school policy here are the reasons why students would pull their grades up, they will always try their best in school, and take school and their grades seriously.

The first reason are grades many students have low grades so in order to make their grades higher the principal could put the policy because it would encourage many students to pull their grades up. I love to play soccer and my parents only let me play if I have good grades and if I get low grades they will take that privilege away. That's why I am encouraged to do my best in school.

Like I said many students like to play sports so they would do anything to be able to play their favorite sport.

The second reason is they will always try their best in school. Many people like to come to school because of their friends and to goof around all day and that will cause them to get low grades. If there is a favorite sport in their school and they want to play it they will try their best in school so they can try out. I know many people who love to play sports and they do play sports in school so many of those people are doing good in school.

The third reason is that they will take school and their grades very seriously. Many people just come to school because their parents make them or because they want to see their friends. They don't take school seriously anymore because many think that what they learn in school is not important. If there was a sport that they like maybe they would pay more attention and make better grades. I know that I would do anything to play my favourite sport and many others would too.

I strongly agree with the principal about the school policy. It is very important that
