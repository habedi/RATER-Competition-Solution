I am for the value of using this technology in students reading emotional experssions because it helps understand more what the paintings are trying to show, for example when the atricle said in paragraph 1 ( she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful , and 2 percent angry) A software is the latest innovation and it developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Other reasons why im for the technology because the process begins when the computer constructs 3-D computers model of the face: all 44 majors muscles in the model must move like human muscles. The movement of one or more msucles is callled an " action unit"

A professor Eckman has classfied six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger,disgust,fear, and sadness then this would associated each with characteristic movements of the facial movements. ( paragraph 2)

My conclusion is that techonlogy is helping us better undertand cultral and seeing the true beauty of it that even in person we can see the diffrences of peoples experssions and their meaning. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.. notes Dr. Huang.
