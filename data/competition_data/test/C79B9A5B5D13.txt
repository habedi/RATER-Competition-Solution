Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the summer months. Some students are not motivated to do the assignment for a variety of reasons. These students tend to have one thing in common, they do not want to do the project. The implementation of student-designed summer projects would make students more motivated and more willing to do the assignment. Student-designed projects also give the opportunity for students to express their ideas.

Motivation is very important for students to complete assignments. Summer projects, designed by teachers, are often very lengthy to complete and are often very boring. Student-designed summer projects would change the motivation that students have for summer projects. By students creating the assignments, assignments would be more understanding of students'

needs and learning strategies. Projects also may be more fun to complete. These factors of a student-designed summer project would help students be motivated to complete the project.

Tying into motivation, students would be more willing to do the summer project if it was student-designed. Students are used to a similar project every summer. Student-designed projects would shake up the summer assignment for every grade level, and be different every summer. Students would not be as unwilling to do the project if it were different every year.

Students also feel the need to express their ideas. Student-designed summer projects would give the students creating the project an opportunity to express their ideas and learning styles. It would help give students the opportunity to create something they are excited about. Collaboration on project ideas would give students and teachers an idea as to what every student wants and doesn't want in the project. It is important that student ideas and needs are taken note to create the project.

Schools that require summer projects should let their students design them. Some students and teachers may not like the idea because it gives students freedom to express their ideas. But, it is important for students to continue learning during the summer, and student-designed summer projects would help students continue to learn over their break.Â
