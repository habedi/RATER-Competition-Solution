Usage of Phones While Driving

Each year thousands of people die in car crashes because of the use of cell phones while driving. The number of these deaths increase with every year. This is a major problem, especially for teenage drivers who are new to the road. Teenagers are not experienced enough and can also be easily distracted by their phones. While driving, if not paying full attention to the road, a teenager or anyone else could easily crash or get into a dangerous situation such as running through a red light because they were talking on the phone. Many states have started to see an increase in the number of people who text and drive and this directly contributes to the growing number of car accidents. Because of this, many states, including Georgia have taken action in an effort to reduce the growing number of wrecks due to cell phone usage. However, it seems that these set rules are not as strict as they should be and many states are quite lenient with the laws. Cell phone use needs to be more restricted while driving any type of automobile.

The first reason cell phones should not be used while driving and should be more restricted is because it is actually illegal in the United States. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 14 states have prohibited all drivers from using handheld devices while driving. Additionally, 46 states have banned texting and driving. State legislatures have seen the exponential growth in texting and driving along with the increase of automobile accidents. Therefore, the majority of the states have made the decision to pass laws that prohibit handheld devices such as cell phones. Many people who use their cell phones while driving have tried to state that they have no problem focusing on their driving while also using their technology. They have said that they have used cell phones multiple times while driving and have not caused one accident. However, researchers have proven that a person who uses their cell phone in any form while driving, is 2.8 times more likely to get into a wreck. Texting while driving is even more dangerous with it being 23.2 times more likely to get someone in an accident. Just because it does not happen to everyone one, does not mean that thousands of people have not lost their lives because of this problem.

Thousands of innocent adults, teens and children lose their lives everyday because of the actions and choices of those around them. When teens or children are in a car with an adult who is using their cell phone while they drive, that adult is putting those kids' lives at risk.

48% of kids in their younger teenage years have been in a vehicle while the adult driver was texting. In addition to that, 1,600 kids in that age range lose their lives every year because of people using their phones while they drive. Cars are amazing innovations that can get anyone to where they need to be quickly and efficiently. However, put them in the hands of someone who is irresponsible and a safe car becomes a potential weapon.

This is why cell phone use needs to be more restricted. Using a cellphone while driving gives the driver inattention blindness and also a slower reaction time. These are symptoms of drunk driving as well. If one would not drive with their children in the car while they are intoxicated, one should not text and drive or use their cell phone at all. A quick text or peek at social media, is not worth an innocent life.

On a lighter note, another reason cell phone use should be restricted is because it will save money. Drivers who do not use their phones while they are driving have financial benefits even if they do not realize it. Imagine all the traffic tickets, accidents and increased insurance rates that every person who uses their cell phone while driving has to deal with. If cell phones are more restricted, people will save so much money. While it does depend on which insurance company a driver is signed with, it has been shown that if one is involved with car accidents due to cell phone use, their insurance rates rise potentially up to 82%. Getting pulled over and handed a ticket more than once, means that person is now considered a high risk driver. High risk drivers have increased insurance or in extreme cases no insurance at all. If the insurance bill increases to be too high and that person cannot afford to pay it off, then the insurance company will sometimes repossess the car.

Any type of cell phone use while driving is extremely dangerous and quite irresponsible.

Restricting cell phones to a higher degree would have many benefits. While plugging in a phone to listen to music is acceptable as long as the phone is not touched afterwards, texting someone back when it is not urgent or checking Snapchat, is not worth taking an innocent life. It is also not worth the driver's life. Car accidents and wrecks will happen to everyone, everywhere regardless of cell phone use or not. There are many other things that can distract drivers. However, not all of those things can be restricted but cell phones can. The rule needs to be enforced more. Once that happens, while wrecks will still happen, it will greatly lower the risk of more people getting hurt because their cell phone controls them and their actions.
