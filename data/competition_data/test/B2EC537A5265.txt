Dear Principal, I think that students should be able to play sports with a grade B average because a grade B is a passing grade and then maybe the students would make their way up to a grade A average.

I also think that many students would then realize that school is just as important as sports are and that if they work hard to get to that grade B average goal that they could achieve many things in life.

I think that students need to consider getting their grades up so that later in life they can say they achieved something and i also think the parents would be proud that their children are working up to that potential that the parents know they have.

I think that if the principal raised the grade average that the students would always focus on getting good grades and that would be their main priority.

I think that most of the students report cards and mid-terms would look a lot better than before.
