To TEACHER_NAME

We the students should have a right to play any sport we want with a C average. In SCHOOL_NAME grading policy for sports state that u need a least a 2.3 to play sports and i speak for the students when i say that it is unfair that we have to be the only school who has this policy that you are trying to pursue.

Have you noticed that if some of the great players out there in the world didn't have a least a B average wouldn't be pro athletes because well i cant guarantee some of those professional athletes out there failed school or had good grades in school. But if some of those guys/girls failed just look a them now playing a sport that they loved there whole life and getting paid good money for it.

My point is that maybe that could be one of us in this school not the people that failed school but the people that passed there classes with a least a C average or higher who went to the pros after high school or college. So don't punish those students who are currently having a high or low C average. Even SCHOOL_NAME is the best middle school with sports it would be just SCHOOL_NAME without sports.

Taking something a child loves away is like getting robbed at a bank it's not good. Believe me when i say taking sports away is like taking our first loves away.

I hope that i had some kind of positive way to change your my on your decision

Sincerely,

A Student that cares!
