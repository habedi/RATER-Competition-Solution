Using technology to identify facial jestures is the unthinkable. If we where to use this type of technology everyday it would be very unusal for the simple fact that school isnt about using technology to tell someones emotions. I don't think it would be really a good idea though to have that in school. The reasoning behind that is because the students would get to destracted from what they are suppose to be doing. Then it would be a destraction to the teachers to, because everytime something seems wrong with a student they would have to take time and try to scan their face when they are not paying attention. It could also be an amazing idea for trying to tell if a kid is starting to form depression or is always sad. The reasoning behind that is because then people have a better chance at trying to help the person in need. It also wouldn't be that of a good idea because if you sitting at home sombody could be watching you through the camera since it would automatically try to evaluate how you feel. Another down flaw to it would be is how would customers come up with the money to buy such edvance techonolgy. After all said and done by the time they get the computer they would have something better to reconize your emotions with. To be able to have this type of technology in a class room would not be right, for the simple fact when you come to school you come here to learn and get the right education you need in life. that is my reasoning behind the FACS ( Facial Action Coding System) why I would not recomend on having this type of technology in my classroom. After said and done it would be to much of a hasial and a destraction when it comes down to using the FACS computer.
