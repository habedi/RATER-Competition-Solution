Do you think students should have the option of taking classes at home online of by conferencing video ?

In many cases there are some peoeple who believe that this is a great idea. I agree with this becaus it lessen the number of conflicts at some schools, there would be less worries about students missing school, and teachers would not have to worry about students skipping their classes

First of all, i agree with this because it would lessen the numebr of conflicts at some schools. for example, in most schools there are students who think that bullying others is the best way to feel good about themselves and to show other students that they are not jus less of a person as the student they are bullying. So if school were to make online school an option it would stop manny kids from getting bullied. Next, many students have cell phones and most of the time they are on social media and this is one the biggest things that cause problems and most students tend to bring them to school. In other words, when students have arguments of the cell phone or social media they carrryon to schools and due this there are many fights. Although, students will still have conflicts on social media if they were to have online classes, and video conferencing there would be less fighting at schools and more learning.

Secondly, there would be less worries about students missing school. For example, in many cases there are a lot of students who only transportation back and forth to school is the bus and sometimes students either miss the bus or oversleep and they will not have a ride to school. but if they were to school on line they would not have to worry about getting on the bus. Next, some students just do not come to school at all because they jus do no like their schoolenviroment. In most cases like this students parent are most likely going to have to be put in the middle of this because it their child and they could possibly get into a lot of trouble. In other words, if students are skipping school becasue of the enviroment maybe if they were giving the option to do school at home it would be better because the very comfortable and maybe it would be more easier to learn.

Lastly, their are many young ladies who have babies and its hard for them to go to school everyday. For example, in many situation like this young ladies tend to miss a lot of school. in other words, when girls have babies they have to been out fo school for six weeks so they can fully develope due this they will way behind because of the thing they missed but if they were giving the option to do online school it would be easier for them because they would be all caught and not left behind in many things. Next, most of the time babies have doctors appointment ever two to three months and because of this young ladies would have to miss school.

In conclusion, do you think students dhould have a option of online school or video confercing. I agree with this because it would lessen the numbeer of conflict, there would be less worries about students missing school, and it would be easier for teenage parents. I believe that having online school or video conferencing is the best thing for some schools and students.
