Have you ever wondered what it would be like to wake up in the morning and complete your school day straight from your bed? As a matter of fact, some schools have begun to offer distance learning, which allows students to particapate in classes from home via online or video confrencing. This idea has had many people on the fence, saying that it could lead to students becoming more lazy and unmotivated in academics, but I disagree with that entirely. I believe that a good portion of students would bennefit from having online courses because it gives them a low stress environment to wok in (if the home is a safe place for the student), and it allows for students who are away on travel or bed ridden from an injury or illness to stay up on school.

School can be stressful and very overwhelming at times. It is scientifically proven that a school environment causes unwanted anxiety and unneccesary stress. I believe that allowing a student the chance to work from home, if it is a safe place for them, would create a very positive outcome. When you give these student's positive stimuli by letting them work in a stress free environment, they will be incentivised to be more productive, and their overall work will be more thought out and well executed. Stress is very big factor in the life of a student, and if you were to help eliminate it that persons overall life would become alot easier. There are also other great uses for this system aswell.

Staying up on your school work is a very vital piece to a student's success in school. If you they behind on work, it can sometimes be a huge challenge to get back on track. That is why I feel that this system would also be very helpful to students who are bed ridden with an illness or injury, or even a student who is away traveling. Most times, when a student misses school they have to make up what they missed from the days they were absent. This forces them to have to balance to much, by not only continuing with their ongoing work but also having them focus on their missing work at the same time. If a student had the available option of distance learning, they could stay actively engaged in the class aswell as recieve immediate help on whatever they needed; moreover, this would allow for an oppurtinity to never fall behind again. These opputunities are all very positive; although, there is still a worry about some student's work ethics suffering or the system not accomodating to everyone.

Many people are concerned with the thought of students becoming lazy and unmotivated by using the distance learning system. This is a very valid claim for a variety of reasons. Students could become overly dependent on the system, causing them to abuse it and consequently miss school even more. There is also the possibillity of students completely disregarding their work, and instead of being productive they could lounge around all day. As I previously mentioned, some students homes are not safe places for them to work in, and this plan would not accomodate them very well. This system has a lot of potential, but as you can see there are still many downsides to it.

The distance learning system is a very unique and potentially very useful system; however, there are still some kinks that need to be ironed out before it can be used to its fullest potential. If the schools can find a way to safely and efficently regulate this system, there is no doubt in my mind that this could be a revolutionary step in education, by giving students a stress free environment and a way to stay caught up on missed school work. This marks a bright day for the future of learning.
