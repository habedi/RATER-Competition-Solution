The author gave no reason or claim to why a dangerous trip to venus would benefit us in any way. The author of this article does include evidence and facts about how hard it would be to get to Venus and all the challenges we would have to undergo to get to Venus.

In this article the author claims that going to Venus is hard but worthy. What makes Venus so worthy? "often referred to as earth's "twin", Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of denisty and size." says the article of this passage in paragraph 2. but then in paragraph 2 he states that Venus has a "thick atmoshpere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets" and "clouds of highly corrosive sulfiric acid" "temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit" and " atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet". The author gave all this evidence of the challenges we were facing to get to venus but he does not say why it is beneficial to us. he gives us more reasons to not want to go to venus.

in conclusion, this author does not support his claim of venus being worthy despite all the dangers and challenges it brings. There is no text evidence or even a reason to go to venus. the author has to include more of the benefits we can get from going to venus, instead of giving us all the challenges.
