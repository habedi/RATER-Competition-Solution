Dear Principal:

I think it's a really good idea of letting us use our phones during lunch periods and other free time. I think it's a good idea because where stuck in class waiting and sitting and staring at boring text books doing work. I also believe we students should deserve some kind of free time for our selves to enjoy on our cell phones. Also it's a good way for us to take stuff off our mind like getting a bad grade on a assignment. it would be a good idea to put our cell phones on silence for the teachers wont get irritated like they usually do.

I think policy one is the best choice for our school. Policy two wouldn't be such a great policy for our school because considering the fact that we wont have phones at school at all is more torture for us students during free times, lunch, and during periods. Also what if your mom or dad is trying to contact you for an emergencies and you couldn't call because cell phones aren't allowed at school at all.

In conclusion, those are my reasons why policy one would be the best choice for our school.
