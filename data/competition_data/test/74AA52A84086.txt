I belive that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it is not possible for people to live on Mars, there are no such thing as aliens, and why would there just be a head shape object and not the rest of the body. In the passage it says, "There was no alien monument after all." Also how could there be life on Mars. Mars has no oxygen so people can breathe. All NASA wanted to do was ," engage public and attract attention to Mars." also in the text it states that NASA said," huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shodows giving the illusionb of eues, nose and mouth."

The Face on Mars is not real because it is just a natural landform caused by erosion and broken rocks. An example from the text is, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."

Secondly another reason the Face is a nautural landfrom is because it is not possible for people to live on Mars. Studies have shown that there is no oxygen on Mars and people can not breathe there. Also the preasure of the gravity on Mars would be too much for a human and could crush their bones and musles. Thirdly, why would the rest of the body not be with the Face. That proves that the Face is just a natural landfrom create by erosion and rocks because if the Face was there on the ground why wouldnt the rest of the body by with the Face.

In conclusion the face is just a natural landfrom becuase NASA have send rovers up to Mars to take pictures of the Face and NASA said themselves,"when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. So that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Also in the text it states," New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."
