Luke bomberger is my name. I am here to provide exaples and state facts to make you want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is about helping people that got left in ruins not just after World War II. They help people if they need animals they will bring you animals from other countrys and if they need help building there houses and everything will bring you people that can build houses and better things!

Some reasons why you would want to join is because do you want to get drafted to the army? I don't think a lot of people do. So be a Seagoing Cowboy. If your with us you will not get drafted. Do you like animals you can help us by taking care of the animals. Another reason why you would like to join is because we have fun after we are done with everything we play table-tennis,fence,read,box,whittle,vollyball, and we also play baseball now doesn't that sound fun."I don't even know what whittling is but i've done it before I think it's fun!"

That is why me,Luke Bomberger want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Also its not just work and play we also learn and get to vist a lot of cool places around the world. I crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice. It made me more aware of people in other countrys and their needs. Thats why I leaded my family to host a number of international of students and exchange vistors for many years. Thank you and good-bye.
