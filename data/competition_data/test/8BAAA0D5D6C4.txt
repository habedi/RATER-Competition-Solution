Dear Principal,

All students go to school to give them the skills they need for there future. Knowing that i think that students should be required to do community service to help there future because community service provides a good look in the society and because it helps them learn how to do more great things.

To start off, I think that students should be required to do community service to make good in our society. Couple of months ago my friend volunteered to help clean up the beaches after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. My family and i thought of going down there to help them out.

When we got there, we saw a bunch of people volunteering. I never thought so many people would do all this work for free. I ask my friend and he said because we wanted to make the world better. Maybe if we volunteer in our society we might make the world better for us and others. 6/10 volunteers, volunteer to help the society stated by the Federal Volunteering Committee.

Volunteering should be required in our school because it helps society and it make it easier for others.
