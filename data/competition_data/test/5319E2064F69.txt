Do you want to join the Seagoing cowboys and dnt know what they do or how many months they'll be gone? i think that everyone should join the seagoing cowboys because in 1945 world war ll was over in eroupe. The seagoing cowboys flew thwir si they could get their food stores back in order because everything waas tore down from the war. You should join because it helps other people and if you're a person who likes to help other people in their time of need then seagoing cowboys is good for you.

The seagoing helps them get their aniamls back their animals back or their houses either because they got tooken away or because somebody burned their houses down. Its a very good program to be in because it helps you learn things about other contries. You get to travel the world and hep people in their time of need. You get to explore the world and explore what sycitey is now. How the world is falling apart, Wars that shoot up houses and food so everyone can starve besides the people who started the war.
