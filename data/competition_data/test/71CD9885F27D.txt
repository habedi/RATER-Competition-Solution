I would tell them its just a natural landform and, its no aliens there must have been a degree surprise among mission we phototgraphed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL revealing a natural landform there was no alien monument after all. Not everybody was satisified but it was the truth after all the the research all the the pictures. It was not true but mission controllers prepared to look again it was hard work. They still kept saying lets prepare to look again Mars Global Surveyor its a mapping they says its a mapping spacecraft that normally look straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine thats why people still think aliens are true on Mars. We was on are second look the Maliens team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Although a few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global surveyors arrived at the Red Planet in Sept.1997. That was the first time when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to tell them aliens are not real.

They say the Face on Mars has since become a pop icon it has starred in a hollywood film, it even haunted grocery store checkout lines 25 years ago. We have evidence Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos we done The situation is done aliens are not real and it will never be its a landform we had Mars Global Surveyor fly over to Cydonia to tell us the truth.
