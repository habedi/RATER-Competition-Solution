You should join the program because,you can experience adventures,and visit many unique places. Also you should join the group because, you can save many lives. You should join the program because,you can have fun, save animals,and more. And I think you should because,you can be a leader,and a really special person to many people. Also it can teach you to be brave and believe in yourself. One more thing,it can be a lot of work,but it is worth it.

To support the reasons why you should join I will give you some examples from the passage. In the passage it says,It was 1995,World war ll was over in Europe, and may countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies,animals,and more,44 nations joined together to form UNRRA,that helpes to support the claim you can save many lives.

Also in the passage it says,"Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China, and that helps to support the claim that you can experience adventures and visit many unique places.

In the passage it says,It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the Unites States and a month to get to china. Caring for the animals during the crossing kept Luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holdsof the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. This helps to support the claim that,it can be a lot of work, but it is worth it.

So if you are thinking about joining good,and I thank you. If you are not interested it is okay. Some people might have their own opinion about things. Some may think that is cool,I want to join the group. And others may think that is not the right job for them,or it seems boring. But whatever you are thinking about doing just do it .And that was my introduction to my essay.
