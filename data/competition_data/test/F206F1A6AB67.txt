Dear Principal,

I feel that it would be wrong if you passed this policy. Some of the sport players are not that smart but if they try they will get a B or C. I think that if they get a D or under they should not be able to play. Some of the sports take up a lot of time for the players have less time to study or do homework. Some sports make you work hard so it gives them a good work ethic and not to quit. For some lower grade kids it good for them to make friends, sports help that a lot. Some kids are just not good a school work but they try and a C is average why do kids have to be above average to play a sport. Different kids are good at different thing so why punish the kids at the thing they a good at, since there not good at another thing. Sports are good since they make people fit, if you took that away from not smart kids then they could become stupid and fat would not be fair.
