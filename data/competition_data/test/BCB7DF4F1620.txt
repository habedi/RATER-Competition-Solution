Dear principal,

I think that not everyone should have to do community service. I think that because if people would rather do other personal things that they would like to do on their time i do not think that it is fair to make them do community service when they do not want to. Also I do not think that kids should be required to do community service because many children have very busy schedules with school sports and many other extra activities in and out of school. So i don't think that it is fair to make children do community service when there schedule is to full to do it. Another reason why I don't think that community service should be mandatory is because some kids already helped out by doing some things in school so I think that it should be their choice whether they would like to participate in community service or not.

But with all of that being said I think that those children who do participate in community service and helping our environment. For example at SCHOOL_NAME, if someone helps out with community service they should receive a pride coupon for helping and giving back to our environment. So I think that if the children are generous enough to take some of their time out of their day to help the environment they should be awarded with something special in all schools across the United States.

I think that helping out our community is a great thing but I do not think that we should have to force kids to help the environment if they are not doing it for all of the right reasons and just doing it so that they could go home and play their video game but like I said before I think that all of the children who do help out with giving back to our environment should be thanked for what they have done for our country.

I hope that I have made a point and thank you for giving me this opportunity to right to you and express my feelings about community service and we should deal with it.

Sincerely,
