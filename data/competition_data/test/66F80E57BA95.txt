Online classes will never be a permanent replacement for a physical learning environment. There's an ongoing debate over whether or not online classes are more beneficial to the student than a real classroom. Some may state that online attendance is more efficient because of a more comfortable environment, the ability to call from anywhere, and it provides easier academic access to those with disabilities, but this is not true. A physical classroom creates a better learning environment and prepares students for their future goals.

There are a variety of reasons why a physical presence is more efficient. Being in the company of other students helps to develop more reliable social skills. Others are more willing to socialize with another student in the same room rather than talking to a computer; therefor, creating beneficial friendships. There are also many social clubs and activities provided by the school to help open up new social groups and further develop personalities. Additionally, many schools tend to apply better support to those who attend face to face. For students who physically attend school, teachers can offer a more intimate teaching setting and provide one on one support for a specific question. Like the social clubs, schools also offer special programs dedicated to providing special support to those students with learning disabilities that may not be available online. Physical enrollment also supports better planning for attendees. School keeps students on a tight schedule, with multiple classes in any given day, forcing them to spend their time wisely. Peers may also support planning by checking in with other students' grades and projects.

There are further reasons why online learning is not as efficient. Physical attendance removes the unnecessary need for technology and the issues associated with it. While attending a class online students' computers may die causing as much as a whole lesson not to be heard. It is also naive to assume online classes can be attended anywhere in the world, as many places do not have public access to the internet. In addition, the student teacher relationship improves upon assignment efficiency and works best with face to face interaction. Students with a excellent relationship with their teachers are often provided more engaging and comprehensive lessons that encourage students to do their best. Teachers are also guided by the way the students learn whether it be physically, auditory or visually; in turn, improving the environment in which they're taught. Furthermore, working with peers enhances students codependency forcing them into new experiences. This prepares students for adulthood where they will have no choice in if they want to work with others or not. Group projects may also allow insight into peers perspectives of the given task or subjects of the world not provided by existing friends.

Real classrooms prepare students for the future by providing more efficient learning environments. This is the case due to the ability to build strong social skills, solidify planning, and create reliable relationships with others. Many state that online learning helps those with disabilities, provides a more comfortable environment, and can be accessed anywhere in the world, but this is not true. Having a physical learning environment develops skills necessary for a better education and the future.
