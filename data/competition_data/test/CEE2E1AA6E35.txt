Luke has many more adventures coming up and you can too. You will be able to visit many unique places just like Luke did.

Being in the Seagoing cowboy program will also give you the oppertunity to help people by sending food and animals over sea with you. You would have to care for the animals too as to help on the trip.

A seagoing cow boy can visit many places. Luke got to visit Europe,China,Acropolis,Greece, ride a Gondola in Italy,and tour a castle in Crete.

Besides visiting all the great places when you are still onboard there is plenty to do besides feeding and watching the animals all day. Luke played games and you would be able to also. There is baseball,volleyball,tennis tourments,fencing,boxing,reading and more. You don't have to sit around and do nothing.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great idea. You get to help people in need of resources, visit different unique places,and even have fun onboard. You can do all this maybe more like Luke did.
