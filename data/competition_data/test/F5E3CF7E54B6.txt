CELL PHONE USAGE POLICY PAPER

I believe policy number one is better. But there are some flaws with it though. It would be better to allow students to have some cell phone usage in a day. Why would you take phones out of schools anyway?

If you completely eliminate cell phone usage then the trouble will definitely shoot into the sky. Students will want to have their cell phones and since they have been banned, then students will start to sneak them. Students have to have there cell phones and will start to get very angry at the schools and stop cooperating well.

If you limit cell phone usage the trouble will go down. some students may still get in trouble, but definitely not as many. The question is: Why use our phones in class if we can use them at lunch and other free time? Why get in trouble for using it now when i can use it later for free?

If you leave the policy the same then students will get worse and worse about sneaking phones. Then teachers will get worse and worse and worse about catching cell phone users. Nothing but the trouble rate will go up.

Using policy number two or leaving it the same will make the trouble rate worse because of sneaking cell phones. Policy number one on the other hand, will cause trouble rates to go down because students will get some usage of cell phones everyday. Why go through more trouble to make the trouble even worse? You should definitely choose policy one so that you have a happy staff and happy students.
