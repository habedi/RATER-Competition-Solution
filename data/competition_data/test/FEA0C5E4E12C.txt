Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am going to tell you why you should make it your duty to have the children at our school do community services. I think we should perform at least a required fifteen hours of community service minimum for each quarter. If we each do a part in making our community better for only fifteen hours four times a year I believe it to be a possibility for our streets to become cleaner and less gang affiliated. I not only mean us student but the employees of SCHOOL_NAME too. The more the better and if not how about just extra credit or something. I'm sure that many people here wouldn't mind helping the homeless or cleaning up the sides of the Highway and the Boulevard. There are many people that would back me up so for our great town of California have your decision not be held on not to do it because it would take to much time or be to hard to see the students time cards or whatever they need to be signed. Decide yes because it is the right thing to do.

-Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
