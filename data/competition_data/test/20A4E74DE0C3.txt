Students have the option to attend classes from home that some schools offer them. It's important for students to get a good education whether they get it from attending to school or online. Schools must focus on some ways students can be benefited from learning. Schools should not offer students options to attend classes from home because students will not take their education seriously, they will be distracted from many things, and they will not learn efficiently.

Many students don't take their lives seriously, especially their education. This school option will make students not to complete their tasks on time. Because they will not have an adult telling them that they need to complete, they will take their education less serious. They will not see education as an important thing. It's likely that they would be slacking around at home, because teachers will not be there to tell them what to do.

There are many things students can be distracted from. Any device, for example, can be a distraction for students. A phone can be a problem for them. It's a distraction that can stop them from learning. There are high chances students would be texting with someone and using social media when taking classes online. They would also be going out too much, leading them to forget that they have classes to take online. At home, they would feel tired and bored because they won't even have any social interaction. They would go out more often and would it would lead them to be distracted every time they go out.

Education is important, but taking classes online will not make students to learn efficiently. They need teachers to guide and tell them what to do. If they don't have a teacher to tell them what to do or how to do it, they will end up confused, not knowing what to do next. They will not be learning anything because they will not understand what they're doing. Their knowledge will decrease due to the lack of learning.

Although some people may say that attending classes at home is good, they are not correct. Taking classes online does not benefit students from learning. In fact, it makes them less productive. They will not have idea of what is going on. Attending classes online is not the best way for students to learn.
