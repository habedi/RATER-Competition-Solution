Dear Our Principal,

I believe that all students should be required to do community service. Here are some reason why I think this should happen. I will also give examples to prove and support my opinion.

First, community service gives students a chance to give back and show they appreciate everything that they have to live for. For example I help the special education class I don't ask for anything in return. It makes me feel good to know that I made someone smile I caused them joy. It also made me realized what I have and to be grateful for it. It could be a real eye opener for some kids. this again is just my opinion.

Last, doing community service also looks good on college and work resumes. It shows your involved and a good leader. Also just shows your a good person and that's what people look for. That's the kind of person that people want to know, want in their colleges, and that's who they want to work for them.

So push students into community service because it helps in the long run and isn't your job to help better students and give them the foundation to a better future. So what are you waiting for make sure your students succeed in life. Keep them off the streets and doing something good.
