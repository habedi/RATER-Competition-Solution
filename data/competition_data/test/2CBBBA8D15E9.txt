For some schools, learning does not stop at the last day of school. They require students to complete projects over the summer to ensure their continued learning. These projects may be assigned by teachers or made by students. While some people think summer projects for students should be student-designed, a teacher-designed assignment would be of better quality and give students a heightened sense of responsibility.

The job of a teacher, among other things, includes the assignment of homework on a daily basis. It is true of a school day, and holds true in the summer. Teachers have taught the material for many years and have a better understanding of what students should know. As such, teachers would be in the best position to design summer projects, just as they design projects and classes in the normal school year. The change of season should not affect their abilities, after all. Through a teacher-designed project, students could keep in touch with their teachers by asking questions, receiving feedback, and furthering their interests. Teachers have school and outside resources that students may not have access to, such as databases and lab chemicals. If teachers are in charge of designing projects, they can ensure proper equipment and supervision to enable students to achieve their goals.

As for students, some would argue that teacher-designed projects would be too restrictive in choice. However, the term "teacher-designed" does not mean students cannot provide suggestions, or that teachers cannot provide multiple options. "Teacher-designed" only means that teachers draw up the final designs; it does not exclude students from the creative process. If students designed their own projects individually, it would be harder to grade fairly because they would be too different. A teacher-designed project would provide a standard for grading that would ensure fairness for all students, eliminating any biases or uncertainty. In addition, teacher-designed projects would also have more authority over a student-designed project: without the authoritative power of a teacher, many students would be reluctant to begin their work. For example, I did not have any teacher-designed assignments last summer. Instead, I tried to make myself practice for the SAT. However, because this project had not been designed by a teacher, I was not sure how to begin studying or which topics to practice first - I did not have a clear idea of my strengths and weaknesses. And because it had not been given by a teacher, I was easily persuaded to slack off at times; I did not have an external force driving me to complete it. Given the opportunity to design my own project, I had made it overly easy because I didn't want to work so hard over the summer. Had it been a teacher-designed project, I would have had a more appropriately challenging task, a better idea of what to work on, and an urge outside of myself to complete it. I wanted to think that I was responsible enough on my own, but when that was not the case, I did not have anyone else to guide me through my task.

In conclusion, summer projects designed by teachers are more well-rounded and balanced than those designed by students. They will be fair; neither too easy, nor too hard. The mere fact that a task is assigned and made by a teacher also implants a sense of responsibility into students who lack self-motivation. If students are left to their own devices, many will make projects that are easy or quickly accomplished so that they will not have to put in effort. When an entire summer's worth of learning is on the line, the question is who to trust with this important task.
