As a student in high school i think the new Facial Action Coding System should be used. My reason for saying that is teachers could use it for their lesson and see if the kids are getting bored of the lesson or liking it so the teacher could use the new technology to help change the lesson or keep it depending on the students facial expressions using the new technology.

For example in paragraph 4 Dr. Huang tells us even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling using video imagery. The new emotion- recongnition software tracks these facial movements. The Mona Lisa is just a painting and the new software technology can even tell thats shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. That in my opinion is amazing who would of guested that we could tell how she was fealing through a painting a couple hundred years later.

The computer contructs a 3-D model of the face and uses the 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles. Their are six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and by the movement in your muscles they can tell what emotion you are feeling.

They tell us in paragraph 7 that our home PC can't handle the complex algorithism used to dicode the Mona Lisa. While looking in the mirror by raising your lips at the corner of your mouth. 2 then quinting your eye slighty to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eye. 3 holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up towards your eyes will describe your emotion being happy.

My introduction is that the new technology is a great idea for for teacher or anyone to use on students it can change the way teachers teach and also change the world.
