Was there another Earth like the one you are living on right now? I and all the NASA researchers ask you this question in a sense that you will understand. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Venus was probaly covered with oceans and life forms. We know this because Venus has surface features that look like Earth's. Through the use of technology, researchers found valleys, mountains, and craters on Venus, leading us to think that it is extremly similar to Earth.

Venus is the second clost planet to the sun and regulates a 800 degree temperature on it's surface. The atmosphere is also covered in thick sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide clouds (author 3). These vile conditions make it impossible for technology to touch the surface. You may ask if it's impossible why are we still trying. The answer is that Venus is extremly similar to Earth and could possibly reveal secrets of the universe.

Through technology researchers have found reminents of valleys, mountains, craters, and oceans. Making it possible that a form of life was once there. Was there life? What happened to the planet? These are questions that are fueling researchers to uncover the true nature of Venus.

In conclusion Venus is analogous to Earth. Reminents of oceans, valleys, and valleys were found. From this knowledge scientists infered that Venus could have supported life. Unfortunelately we are having trouble testing this theory since Venus' surface is 800 degrees. If we can somehow collect data from Venus depsite the danger, it would be vital for Earth and the human race in general.
