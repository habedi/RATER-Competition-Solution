Phones and driving

Over the years technology has done nothing but advance forward with time. Resulting in two of many of society's most used technology; automobiles and cell phones. Cell Phones were created to make communication a lot easier, as well as mobile. So that one could easily contact or be contacted anywhere at any point. With vehicles it was somewhat the same deal, Find an easier, and quicker way to travel. Individually both inventions are credible to society, but is it safe for drivers to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? No, it is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.

In order to use a phone your eyes, hands and attention must be on the device, looking through apps or sending messages can be very distracting while driving. Distracted is one thing one should not be when operating a vehicle, distracted driving can result in an accident which can either seriously injure or kill someone. When it comes to accidents caused by distracted driving the numbers are higher amongst teen drivers. In this generation teens are addicted to their phones and social media, it is harder for them to find a disconnect even when driving. "In 2017, nearly 40 percent of high school students reported texting or emailing while driving." "Distracted driving is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. In 2015, 391,000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents. In that same year, distracted driving was cited as a major factor in 3,477 traffic deaths." These statistics further prove how a cellular device should not be in use while driving a vehicle.

While using a phone when driving is extremely dangerous there is an alternative to using a device while operating a vehicle, bluetooth. Some people who have business related occupations may already have a bluetooth earpiece, but car manufacturers are now including bluetooth systems inside their cars. This feature allows one to connect their phone to their car, so that they can easily answer the phone by clicking a button on their wheel, and the car can read out sent text messages. One can respond by using voice typing, this allows people to easily answer phone calls and text messages without having to physically take their hands off the wheel. Minimizing accidents caused by distracted driving, talking on the phone and thinking on how to respond to a message can still be distracting and remove focus from the road. Therefore, even using the Bluetooth feature can be a cause of an automobile accident.

Overall, neither phones or alternative phone systems should be used while operating a vehicle. It is too distracting and the effect of one simply answering a text or phone call could be their or another driver's life. All phone calls, text messages, and photos can be answered and liked once the destination has been reached. It is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.
