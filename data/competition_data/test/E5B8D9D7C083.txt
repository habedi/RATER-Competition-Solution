Most schools require students to complete summer projects. Over the years, there has been a debate if these programs should be student-taught or teacher- taught. Summer projects should be teacher- designed because, teachers have a greater knowledge of the subject, are trained to keep kids engaged, and know how to plan a lesson that students can relate to worldly.

Teachers all around the world study the subject(s) that they teach. This gives them greater knowledge than any student would have. Most teachers are required to graduate college, and get a teaching degree as well, (some teachers even get their masters). That is more years of studying a single subject than any high school student may have. Studying this single subject for many years, gives them a lot of experience, and specific knowledge to help educate a student on the subject. Although students can always learn the material, they may not have as great of knowledge as a teacher on one specific subject. Teachers have at least four years of knowledge that a students don't and thats why they're better teachers than a student.

Along with four years of college, teachers must receive a teaching degree. While studying for this degree, teachers learn how to plan out lessons, and keep kids engaged. A teacher would better keep kids engaged, because they are trained to keep kids focused, and keep them involved in the material they learn in class. Weather this is; keeping kids involved in class by doing a project that is hands on, or having them start conversation to create development of their skills and knowledge. Some may argue that students would keep kids more engaged, due to how they can relate to kids their own age, teachers can relate to students too. Teachers know what its like to goo through schooling, because they had to do it too. Teachers are trained to keep students entertained, and develop their skills inside and out of the classroom.

Most teachers enjoy learning about their subject they teach daily, this keeps their material relevant and reputable. Making sure that the teachers material is relevant, helps kids from around the world be able to relate to the lessons. Mr. Generic_Name, is a second grade teacher at Generic_School. Over the summers he likes to practice his teaching, by traveling the world to see if his material is still relevant in other countries. Many teachers will do this to ensure that what theyre teaching their class is resignating with each student. Keeping teachers' content relevant is a sure way to keep kids relating to the topic.

Summer rprojects should be relatable, engaging, and well taught. That's why Teachers should teach Summer Projects. They've had years of experince, teachers can relate to kids, keep them engaged, and create lessons that relate to the world. Teachers are the best fit to direct summer projects.
