participating in an extracurricular activity might be fun and interesting for some students but not for all of them.

every student have different interests and different activities that they enjoy doing. requiring students to participate in a activity might not be a good idea because students have other interests and other activities that they enjoy, not all students have time to participate and students would not be successful doing an activity that they dont want to do or not enjoy doing it.

because students have other interests and other activities that they enjoy doing. Not all students have enough time to participate in one of this activities. some students might not even be able to participate. this might be a good decision for students who enjoy doing this activity but to make it fair for all it shouldnt be a requirement. instead it should be optional. in that case students who actually wants to do one the activities can join and students who dont can find an activity to do which they enjoy doing.

according to studies students tend to be more successful when they do a activity that they enjoy especially when they pick the activity them self because students always pick activities that they know they will enjoy and will be successful in.

in conclusion, i disagree with the idea of requiring students to participate in one extracurricular activity because most of the student might not be successful doing an activity that they are required to do, students might want to do other activities instead of extracurricular activities and it might be better to make this a optional activity.
