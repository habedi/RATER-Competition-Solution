Does a computer that can tell when you are happy or sad make a difference. I thinks so because if this happens we can make a computer make a video game AI actually smile using the same muscle groups that we use. It could help students understand more in class. It could even be used in police interigations. This could help this world out.

Gamers all around the world want games to be more human like. With computers that can read and recreate human emotions could help that alot. It would give AI more human like reactions to unrealistic things. It would make the games way more fun. It would also help animation. Disney would really benifit from human like facial reaction in the movies.

Students get confused easily and for online courses that would be a lot harder to notice. With computers that can read human facial reactions they could help when students get confused. I would help the student and the online school would benifit from that. That could prove to be very useful.

Peoples muscles it the face move no mater how straight faced they are and sometimes Police Interigaters miss those little thing and then they get away. With computers that can read facial reaction any muscle movements in the face would be seen and then they would not get away with what crime they have made. This would lower the crime rate and would make police work a little easier. That would be very helpful to the police station.

In conclustion Computers that can read emotions off of the face would greatly benifit society. It would make police work easier. It would help students with there grades and if they get confused. It would greatly improve video games to make them more realistic.
