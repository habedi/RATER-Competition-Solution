Cell Phones

I think the principle should not allow students to have phones at school at all. I think that is a better decision then allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. I think that because that may affect the students learning and education. For an example a students was texting another student of something that happened in a different school.

Then she told her what happened, but she didn't tell her everything because the student has to go to class now.

Today was a really important lesson, but the student didn't pay attention at all because she wanted to know what happened next and she was wandering and dreaming.

She didn't pay attention at all and when she took a test the test had some questions that had to do with that lesson, but guess what she failed. The other student was in class when she was texting. She didn't pay attention because she was busy texting and also that affected the other students learning and education and she also failed the test because they also had a really important lesson that they needed to know. That's why its really important to not allow students to bring phones in school at all.

Also if the student bring phones to school that also might disturb other students. For an example when you bring your phone to class and you forgot to turn it off then it rings all the sudden. That might disturbed the whole class and also might affect the other students learning. I also think they should put that as a school rule in all schools that "Phone's are not Allowed to be in School".

Never ever bring your phone to school at all. I think that would be the best policy for all schools.
