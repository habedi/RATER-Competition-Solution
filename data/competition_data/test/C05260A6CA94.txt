In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author tell me about the technology called Facial Action Coding System. Im will being find details in the passange on how the technology identify human emotions.

Frist I will be telling you what's the Facial Action Coding System how it works. It is a technology that Dr. Paul Eckman created he has classified six basic emotions on it. scuh as (happyiness,suprise,anger,disguts,fear,and sadness.) what this technology does is show the emotions that universal. the new emotion recongnition software tracks the facial movements.

Now I will be arguing weather the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I think this is a bad idea for the technology emotional thing to be in class room to read students emotion becuase if a student is upset for a reason and the emotional mechine read there feeling maybe the student didnt wanna tell there personal binusness about there feelings. I also think its a bad idea because what if the technology mechine tell you your feeling a suertion way but then the mechine got it wrong, then the teacher would be naging that person on about there mood.

I told you all about how the Facial Action Coding System works. I told you my opinion how its bad if they have the technolgoy in the class for it to read student emotions. and how it would effect the mood if the mechine got the emotion wrong.
