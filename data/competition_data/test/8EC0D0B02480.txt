Well I do believe in supernatural life form, but i don't think that aliens would do things like this. Personally based on my opinion is that it could've been just the way it looks. Like how it resembles a human face, has eyes, a nose, the head shape, could be just the way it devoloped over decades and centuries over time. This does'nt mean that it work of an unknown species. Its just a natural landform that has developed the shape of a human face over time. But i can also see how other would think that. yes, I admit it is an odd thing to see, but theres a million different stories of how this particular piece became known to all the human race. So us scientists, at NASA are going to find the real story behind this unfounded clue. Also do promise that the story that we get will be the truth, and also be shared to the public people of the United States. This clue has a million questions, and a million accusations. But what i think over my years of research is that there was no alien lifeform that created the face of mars. Just alot of great odd things happen. It just seems to be that this is one of them. But us scientists at NASA promise to find the real truth, tell the real truth, and plan to make it known to the human race.
