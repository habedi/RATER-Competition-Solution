Dear Principal,

I must be impressed that your tutors are doing a fine job helping the community with community service. I know that if we do perform community service, I know that I will be spending to much time on community service than actually doing schoolwork. If we do community service, then we will help our community service a better place to live. I believe that students should be part of community service so we could save the community from being dirty and not being clean as were suppose to. Even your school will be nice and clean as is it now. All dirty will litter on the floor. So please allow your students to take action into helping our community. The tutors that are helping with the community have the best intentions, making it better to do better things. If we could help the community, they will thanks us for helping them clean up litter and take all the junk out of the ocean.

Thank you for your time.

Sincere, Student
