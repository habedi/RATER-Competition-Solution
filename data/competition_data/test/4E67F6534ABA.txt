To the principle:

I believe that students should be able to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free periods, as long as they are turned off during class. Students prize their phones and feel insecure without them; therefore, it might be better if they are allowed to keep them in their backpacks.

Phones are a problem; they are a distraction in the classroom and in the halls, even if we are not allowed to use them. Some students pay more attention to their phones then the teacher or other people around them. During class students are looking down and texting their friends instead of paying attention to what they are supposed to be learning. In the hallways students are looking at their phones instead of watching where they are going. Not only are they bumping into others but they are also late to class. It is dangerous in the hallways and is causing grades to suffer. But I do not believe that banning them from the school is the best way to solve this issue.

Many times, students are giving phones by their parents for safety reasons and if they are not allowed to bring them to school the parents might get upset. Right now students are allowed to bring phones to school as long as they are turned off and inside our backpacks until school is over. If students aren't allowed to bring their phones at all they might rebel and bring them anyway by sneaking them in their pockets and backpacks. Phones, and other electronics, are a big part of today's society and students are proud to be a part of it. If they are denied to be able to part of that society, even if it is only during school hours, it will anger them. But students would be more willing to cooperate if there was a compromise, such as being able to use their phones during certain times of the day. I believe this is the most reasonable solution. Instead of having students try to smuggle their phones into school and sneakily text during class periods they would be willing to wait till lunch and other free periods.

So I believe that students should be able to use their phones during lunch period and other free periods. It will solve the issue of grades suffering and will also please the students.

Thank you.
