I don't think students should be forced to do community service because some of the kids would slack of and let the other kids do the work and still get credit. Especially if the principal is wanting them to do it after school hours, some kids have family or sport commitments they have to attend. The schools job is to teach the kids not to make community workers. I feel it would be acceptable for the school to imply how community service would be good and have organisations available. Teens need freedom to make their own decisions weather it be right or wrong and if it's wrong hopefully they will learn from it. When teens are told what to do all the time they usually just want to do the complete opposite or don't know what to do when they have to make choices. I do believe teens need structure though. If a teen is rebellious and act emotionally strong they usually just need to talk to some one. It sounds cliche but it's the truth. I thinks those are the kind of people we need to have a good community they stand by their opinion and don't need to lean on anyone for direction, but the schools and community look at them like they're bad kids. If schools make community service a requirement it would be handicapping the kid in later years about decision making.
