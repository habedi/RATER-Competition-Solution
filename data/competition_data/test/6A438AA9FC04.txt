Dear state senator,

I believe that the United States election should be changed to popularity vote. wouldnt that be easier than a Electoral College? I beleive so and i bet many others also believe that a popularity vote is way better. I stongrly encourage a(n) Popular vote becuase its easier, less complicated, and faster.

Dont you think a popular vote would make it way easier for not just the fellow citizens of America but for you guys? I believe that this would be a great change not for the bad but for the good. The popular vote all you have to do is count and state who had more and bam! its that easy! Its just 123 and your done. Isnt that much easier? Not a long process or any of that. imagine just voting once for the president and being done with all that?

Wouldnt having a popular vote be less complicated? you wouldnt have to do the state elector or have any more requirements. All you have to do is whoever has more wins! also in the Elecoral College the voters dont even vote for the president butÂ  for a slate of electors?? what is that nonsense? shouldnt citizens have the freedom of voting for who they want as president? I thought this was the land of the free? How would bigger states have a voice if it was the same as the smaller ones?

Dont you believe that a popular vote would also be a faster way of the elections? its just 123. Electing electors to vote for you just takes way to long. By the time your done with that you couldve been done with the presidential elections if you wouldve just had a popularity vote from the start. Everything you do is based on time so wouldnt it just be easier for everyone to vote and boom! its all over. Its not just faster for us but for y'all also.
