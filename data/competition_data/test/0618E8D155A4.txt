Do you really think that there is a face on mars? Think about it, is that really logical? I am going to explain to you why this idea is not logical. I think that the face on mars is just the background for a couple of reasons. These are my reasons.

First, it is impossible for there to be aleins because there is no water. Every living organism needs water. Another reason why it cannot be aliens is that when they did a close up they didnt find anything. The camera was special because it caught even the smallest of things. For example, if there was some sort of shack, this camera's lens could spot it, as said in paragraph 11. Another reason why i think that this could just be a coincidence is that every planet has oddly shaped landmarks. For example, earth has rocks hat are all placed in a circle in Ireland.

In conclusion, this why I think that this face on mars is just a coincidence and a landmark. These reasons are why you should believe my theory. Thinking that it is some kind of alien landmark is a uneducated idea. These are my reasons.
