In school, they offer a veriaty of extracurricular activites. For example, they have sports, clubs, student council, and yearbook work. Students would benifet from at least one extracurricular activity provided by the school. I agree that schools must let all students participate in at least one after school activity because, it builds teamwork, leadership, and gives students and oppertunity to make friends.

Group projects or activites can be a challenge for students because, they don't usually work with others. That is why building teamwork is very important. Extracurricular activities can help build teamwork with sports, clubs and other activities. It gives students an opportunity to work with others and build teamwork skills. Sports are a great example because, students have to work together to complete a goal. Also it can help make group projects in class less difficult.

In addition, extracurricular activities also build leadership. In knowing how to be a leader you can set your own goals and lead others. In every extracurricular activity, there is a leader that is the head of a team. They act as a back bone that keeps the team or group in line. Without a leader it is hard to do anything. If we get all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, than students can learn how to become a leader and use leadership.

Finally, extracurricular activities help students make friends. School can be hard to make friends in; especially if you don't have classes with anyone you know. If we have after school activities, than students can have time to make new friends and hangout with old friends. It can be easier for students to work easily among friends because, then they feel more confadent. In addition, extracurricular activies help make new friendships. When working with new people, it can lead to creating friends you would not have thought to have become friends with in class.

I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it builds leadership, helps make friends, and builds teamwork. Sports, clubs, student council, and working on the yearbook are all great ways to build these skills. They can be helpful in both class and in our daily lives.
