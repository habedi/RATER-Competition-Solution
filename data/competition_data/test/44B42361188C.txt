Distance learning

Online classes or video conferencing would benefit students because they will have the opportunity to work at their own pace, be free from the distraction of other students, and lower their anxiety and stress levels from being in a large environment. Distance learning can be very beneficial to students in many different and scientifically proven ways.

Students that have the chance to work at their own pace are statistically proven to be far more successful than being dragged along at the learning pace of his/hers class. Distance learning would help students that preform better their own pace by allowing them to play or repeat video and conferencing assignments to get a greater understanding of the task at hand.

A lot of the time, students, like myself, will be listening to a teacher and then instantly forget what they were talking about once they have finished explaining the directions. This is probably on of the most common mishaps any student could relate to when attempting to learn something in school. Online video classes, can eliminate this struggle by allowing student to review and replay the video lessons.

In class distractions, such as noises or disruptions from class mates would also be eliminated which would be largely beneficial to the student. Working in class and having a paper airplane thrown at the back of your head can easily throw someone off track from what theyre trying to learn. This never ending issue can be resolved to help students stay on track and not have to worry about anyone else being a distraction to them while they learn from the comfort of their home.

Anxiety and stress levels from the average student remain extremely high in today's world due to social status, college readiness, and challenging courses. Having to do class assignments and learning from video conferences can greatly affect a students learning process and lowers stress levels. Studies show that 96% of student report lower stress and anxiety levels when completing video assignments and online classes from home. This is mainly because of the tension and extreme environment a lot of schools may carry when having such large or populated students.

While some may argue that distance or video learning can cause increased distractions and do more harm than good, most dont realize then greater amount of distraction in school than in the comfort of their home. Distance learning can and will be a more effective choice for students that want the opportunity to work at their own speed, be more focused from by having the eliminated distraction of other students, and lower their stress levels from being in a large environment.
