dear, principle

I think this is a good idea because it will get kids to do better in school so that they can play the sport they want to play in. But you need to have some changes i this. number one you need to give 2 warnings to the kids before you tell them that they cannot play in that sport. Number two when they cant play you need to mail home a letter to there parents. Also send a report card so that they can see what you son/daughter my what they might be missing so they can get it done. But if they don't get it done they will have lunch in the teachers room in till they get it done. This is what i think about if you change the policies and what other kids might think i don't know they might get mad. But this is your option and u led our school.
