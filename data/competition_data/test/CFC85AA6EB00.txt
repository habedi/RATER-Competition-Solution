The creation of the Facial Action Coding System has the potential to be very innovative and useful in today's society. In schools, teachers often have difficulty obtaining the attention of students and maintaining it when they have it. This could be a result of the way they are teaching, and how it makes the students feel. The use of FACS in all classrooms would be found valuable.

Problems such as obtaining attention could easily be solved with the use of the FACS. If students are placed in a classroom, and are unhappy and bored, they are less likely to pay attention and learn at the rate they are capable of. The FACS can record these students' emotions and help change the method of teaching used in that class to interest the students. As stated in the passage by Dr. Huang, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This could potentially change the students attitude towards learning for the better.

A teacher is capable of understanding verbal communication better than that which is nonverbal. Unless a student tells their teacher he or she is confused or bored, the teacher has little to no way of knowing this. Dr. Huang states, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication." The FACS is able to detect such forms of emotion, and make corrections based upon them. This process makes the FACS more capable of dealing with these situations than any teacher.

Emotion is displayed often through facial expressions. Certain muscles in your face respond to specific emotions you are feeling at the time. It is not uncommon for a student to put on a fake smille or expression of understanding towards a teacher when he or she is bored and could care less. A teacher may have some difficulty understanding if the student's emotions are real or fake. Luckily the FACS recieves data from the recognition of movement in muscle tissues. The FACS is programmed to recognize which muscles move during each emotion. To provide an example the author explains, "But in false smiles, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius." SInce a different muscle is used in fake smiling than in that which is real, the FACS can tell the difference between the two expressions with ease.

The facts about FACS suggest that it is a perfect candidate for the use of innovative technology in the classroom. This system can improve the learning rates, as well as the mental growth of the students in a classroom. FACS can easily be proven valuable in all classrooms, as well as in many other environments among modern society. FACS proves that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.
