In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is an interesting planet to learn about. The author states "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because its Earth-like." However, Venus has a thicker atmosphere than earth. The fahrenheit of Venus is extremely hot. It's possible that any NASA person could visit this planet and understand Venus.

Scientists will figure out a way to travel to Venus and get more information than they already have. For example, somebody from NASA could reach the planet and get to know so much such as; what it looks like and the temperature. They would report back to the boss with every piece of information they've received. The temperature could affect the traveler because its possible to have a heat stroke if they are not careful enough.

The scientists and NASA are being limited by the dangerous travel to Venus. A life could be lost so they are being doubted. Reseachers are not able to research any minerals from Venus unless the rocks, or what not, are brought back to earth by a traveler. Studying Venus is a worthyy pursuit despite the dangers that might come with.
