The author of this passage seems to support the idea of traveling to Venus but also seems to have his doubts at the same time. In paragraph 4 he says "If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even dicussing further visits to its surface" That statement from the passage doesn't seem like it would come from someone who supports the idea.

The other reason I personally believe he doesnt really support this is because when you read passages of people supporting ideas, they dont really go into the negative things that could happen. The author of this went well into detil of the hazards and dangers that can occur on venus. In paragraph 5 he says " Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." He is saying that even after NASA figures out a way to make it to Venus, it would still be extremely difficult but you probably won't die.

My conclusion of this passage is that the author does not fully support the topic he is writing about and for many reasons. Yes, Venus may have had a good enviroment that could have sustained human life in the past but it doesn't anymore. I think we should stop trying to explore somewhere that could harm you.
