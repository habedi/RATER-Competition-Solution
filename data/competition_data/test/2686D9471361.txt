Online courses are unique and helpful to students unable to attend class; however, the quality of education is unmatched. Many students today have little time on their hands to attend school, whether that be from family issues or working full time jobs. Online courses and video conferencing is their best shot at getting an education. Online courses are limited to only a few hours a day and students don't always have their teacher in their presence in order to ask questions or for help on their work. While taking online courses may seem like a logical solution, it is not all that simple.

People are put in tough situations in life, where they have to make the decision to not attend school and miss out on their education; unfortunately, limiting their opportunities in the future. If less fortunate students have the chance to take online courses or video conferences in a way its a blessing. For example, if a student has to drop out of school in order to take care of their family at home; being given the opportunity to keep pursuing an education makes a major impact, on that student's present and future life. If a student takes online courses instead of just quitting on their hopes and dreams, getting into college would be easier and the chances of students getting well paying jobs goes up. Even though there are not many positives to online courses and video conferences, they still make the world of a difference

Many negatives follow with taking online courses or video conferences. Although, the idea of taking classes at home is genius, it can get expensive. For example, If a student is struggling to put food on the table for his family they wont even think about paying for these overpriced courses. If Schools really want kids to succeed these classes should be free or set at a low price. If students could afford to pay for online classes; employment for them would go up, setting them up for a better future.

Quality learning will always be better than limited learning. When taking online courses you don't get the same environment as you would being physically in school. For example; sitting in a classroom with other students and teachers you have people around you who can help you succeed, who want you to succeed. If a student is confused with something, they have their classmates and teachers to work with. Being in school and working with other people teaches social skills as well and how to work in a group which is key when joining the work force. You dont get that experience and preparedness at home staring into a computer screen.

If a student's only option at furthering their education is online classes, by all means they should take them. Although if students have the option to stay in school, they would be wrong not stay. Expanding your education really can only happen in the classroom, you can't bring a classroom to your house. Students should not be hesitant of pricing or time limits when it comes to their education. While online courses makes great differences in human lives, they should not be a students first choice.
