The author supports his ideas by show and telling that NASA is working on other prouches to study Venus. In paragraph 7 telling use about how electronics played an important role in the 1940s. so more ideas of electronics would help the author study even more an get even more info about Venus. Dispite the dangers it presents if they make robots that have the mind set on studying Venus that would change the danger of othes and we will have more info of how humans will be in harm of. i just feel like that humans should have 2 planets and were more then capable of doing that so and the author has a point that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the vey edge of imagination and innovtion. Thats shouldnt be a challenge theres so much value cause this planet will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavor.
