Dear Principle ,

I know that you think that it is right for all of the students to do community service. In my point of view i don't think that all students should be forced to do the work if they chose not to. Don't get me wrong it is a good reason and is also for a good cause, but some people don't see it that way.

First off some kids may have important things to do other that community work. Many students could be involved in sports,clubs,or any other types of organizations. I myself play sports and do other activities, so most of the free time i have that is how i spend it. There could be other personal reasons some students chose or decide not to participate in the work/community service.

Some students may not want as well like to be forced to do the work/community service. They may think that their time does not have to be wasted doing the community service, and it would not be right to force them to do the work. Also we should not be required to do the work because we go to school to learn get a good education and make something or to better ourselves. So the service would not have anything to do with any of these thing so why should me and my should have the choice to do the community service if we decide not to or to do the work.

That is were i stand on the topic of being required to do community service. Please take what i say into consideration.

sincerely

STUDENT_NAME,
