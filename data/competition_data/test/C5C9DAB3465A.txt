I think that there shouldn't be any driverless cars. There are a couple of reasons why i think that there shouldnt be any driverless cars. One way is that all people need to know what to do when driving, also needs to know all the signs and what they mean. Also i think people need to focus on what is going on infront of them. Yes, it's a smart idea but there also could be somethings wrong with it.

Theres many reasons why it's a bad idea and some good things that come out of it. What if something goes wrong with the car and malfunctions. The car can put a lot the owners at risk. Some good reasons for the driverless car is, some people wnats to drink like coffee and doesnt have enough time and also might want to eat breakfast, but if they are in a hurry to get to work the driverless car is there to drive itself for you to have time to eat. It really is a smart idea. If safety is a big concern they need to think about every possible outcome there is for the safety of the owner.

Here are some reasons why the driverless car could be a good and bad idea. In my opinion i still think it's a bad idea, but some people might think otherwise. Some people might need that type of car to work with their scheldrules. It even says in paragraph 9, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault, the driver or the manufacturer?" My opinion for that is i think it will be the manufacturer that is at fault, because they want people to buy this car and when people do things could go wrong. All people are different. That's my opinion, so what's yours?
