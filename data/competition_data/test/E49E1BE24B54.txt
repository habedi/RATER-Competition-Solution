To the principal,

I think all students should be able to participate in sports or other activities even if they have a C average on their grades because the principle may not know how good the student is on the activity or in the sport. The student may be able to represent the school based on the activity or sport they know how to do best.

If the students had a lower than a C average then they couldn't be able to play because their grade would be lower. If the students had a B average then they should be able to play sports or participate in other activities because they are not failing any classes.

I think your being unfair with the students who have a C average because they are still passing the class but not with the best grade yet, they should be able to join activities and sports because they are still passing their classes.

I think you should let them participate because without the ones who play more sports and join activities you will have less chances of making your school better by showing how good a person with a C average is in sports or activities.

If you let the students with a C average play sports you might not know if they are good at sports and they could represent your school by winning a game like for example: baseball, football, soccer, etc. these students can make a better chance of your school being number one on sports and activities so please rethink and make the right choice.
