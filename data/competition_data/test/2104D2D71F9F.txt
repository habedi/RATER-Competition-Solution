Dear Principle,

Imagine a boy who goes to football practice at school knowing that he worked hard for it by raising his grade. This would be the result of having students need a grade B average to do sports and other activities. I believe that by passing this rule the average letter grade of students will rise from a C to at least a B. First of all, students will earn their place in sports and other activities knowing they earned it through hard work and focus. Second, more students will be encouraged to do well in school. Last but not least, students grades will be considerably higher.

While some students may rebel to the idea with myriad reasons it should not be passed, I believe that grades are still very important. A well rounded education is the base to having successful grades in school. Although students are given this they are not putting as much attention and effort into their work. By passing this rule more students will take the issue at hand more seriously and suitably.

So as you can see, by passing a rule where students have to have a grade B average to participate in sports and other activities, you will be endorsing the idea that all students should focus on school.

Sincerely,
