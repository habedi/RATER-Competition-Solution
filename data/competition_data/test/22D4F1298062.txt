grade c and higher should be able to play sports. you should see that your students is trying there best. Most kids like to play sports so you should let them play cause they might be good at the sport they want to play in. Some kids have thinking problems and they might get a d as there grade are lower. And they should be in the sport they are good at. So i think that the principal should change that rule for the kids. Its no the kids fault that there not good with school but they still try to do there best. Maybe for the kids that were not able to play sports might even just get teased at school and maybe get depressed. And if that don't help i would transfer school to a better school. I would try to help the other kids but if i could not help i would just tell the kids to go to a better school that will let you play sports. You should just try to help the kids and try to bring there grades up higher. If they could not bring there grades up are try to i would make them take summer school. I think that the teachers should just be working harder with there school kids like with math are any school subjects they are having trouble with. If the kid is having trouble and still want to play sports they should just b able to play a sport lower. Some say that its not the students fault its there teachers cause they are not helping them that good. I think more kids would like school more if there teachers could help them a little bit more. No child should be struggling at nothing as long as if they have an aid are some one to help them with there school work they would be doing just fine.
