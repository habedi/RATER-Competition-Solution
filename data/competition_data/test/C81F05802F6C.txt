What i think about having cell phones at school is that you should let us have phones, because you need to call someone to bring something important to you like text books for a class. Also why i say its a good idea to have cell phones at school is that you can use them on your free time and use them in case of a emergency, like you have to call your mom to tell her that your going to your friends house after school. If students were to use their phones in class then they will get it taken away and will get it back by signing a contract stating that he or she will never use their phone in class ever again, but if they do use their phone again they will get it taken away for the whole day and their parent have to come pick it up. So that's why i think it would be a good idea if you could have cell phones at school.
