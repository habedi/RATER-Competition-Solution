Not every student should have to have an extracurricular activity, escpecially if it's worsening their grades.

Every one of the students get homework from almost every class, making free time after school more difficult to find. Having required time for other things for school will be too much and overwhelm many students, causing lower grades and higher stress. Some kids can't go to any afterschool extracurricular activity because of family problems, or their parents may not be able to bring them to where-ever they may need to go. If there are extracurricular activities going on during school time, some students may miss class work and be left behind, making more homework, making more stress and less sleep.

Since every student is required to be in 'at least one extracurricular activity', then teachers will be overwhelmed as well. Teachers already have to get to school earlier than students do, and they have to work at home as well. Making their jobs harder with the same pay won't be helpful for anyone. Students could be spending their time more wisely than being forced to serve in student council. Teachers would have less time to work (or sleep) with now having to manage a new project for school.

Setting up extracurricular activies requires work too, getting someone to set them up will take time and money, and it won't be worth it if no one wants to be a part of it. Student council doesn't seem useful or important in Middle school and sports shouldn't be required because some students could live too far away, or could be incapable of playing any games.

Having required extracurricular activities would simply make school more busy and may lower students grades. If it were up to the students to decide, it would be pretty clear what we would want.
