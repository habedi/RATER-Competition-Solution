Us students work very hard to obtain our grades and keep them at the appropriate letter grade. The new proposed rule stating that students need a B or higher in order to be allowed to participate in after school activities is unneeded and worthless. It will only make the students mad and unwilling to do their work or keep up their grades. By taking away any sport or activity some students loose motivation and let their grades slip, this will be a more common occurrence if the school continues with this rule.

It is proven in scientific studies that active lifestyles help the brain do a better job in the classroom. So why take that help away? I have already stated that taking away a students motivation will cause more harm, but taking away its ability to function will make matters even worse. A survey states that students who are involved with a sport or special activity have higher grade point averages than those students who are not involved. If this rule sticks our students will soon be doing a far worse job in keeping up grades and attendance.

I believe that the school should come up with a compromise for the students on the topic of grades. For example, if the student has been failing the class or barely passing it for several weeks, they should be temporarily cut off from the sport or activity.

Taking away all means of exercise, whither it be physical or mental, can be very disappointing to the schools outlook. Therefore, that is why the rule should be changed or made better, for the overall outcome of the school as a whole.
