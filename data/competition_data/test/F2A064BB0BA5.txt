You should be a Seagoing Cowboy. It is very fun and can help others who are in need of animals. You could adventure during your free time and it is so amazing.

You can explore places like the Acropolis in Greece. During free time we play table tennis, we fence, and we have boxing matches. We also play volleyball and read. You can feed animals like horses. Even though it is hard work it is still very fun and you should try it. You can help on farms. It is fun to water the animals to keep them clean and to feed them so they do not go hungry. You can excavate a castle or take a gondola ride. Hard work can be fun if this is your job. There are plenty of horses and food for them in the ship.

You can make plenty of trips, but they might be long. It is fun sailing across oceans seeing the fish and the water as long as you do not mind getting sea sick or homesick. Some trips can take two whole weeks. Some can even take a month. It can be dangerous if you do not be careful. You could even get cracked ribs.

In conclusion, I think you should consider being a Seagoing Cowboy because, it is fun and you can help others.
