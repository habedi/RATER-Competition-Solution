Extracurricular activities are enjoyable and can help you in so many ways!

They can help you in school, at home, and can maybe help better yourself as person. I agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can be fun and very enjoyable.

Extracurricular activities can help you in school and help you become a harder working student.

Extracurricular activities could help with students ability to focus and understand better. Students level of focus could go up meaning that you would pay more attention to all your classes and help get your bad grades up to more acceptable and better grades. They can also help with some students attitudes in class or towards school and classwork. Some students may have a personality change for the better which could lead them to have a better outlook on school and classwork. Extracurricular activities can also help your grades! Many students have bad grades because they can't focus or think the work is too complicated or hard, which isn't the case, by being in any extracurricular activity your whole brain might do a flip and you could begin to understand and work towards getting those A's and B's.

Extracurricular activities may benefit you in school by giving you better focusing abilities, giving them a better, more positive, attitude about school and classwork, and can even bring their grades up by a lot because they have more enthusiasm and a much better ability to focus than they did before!

Extracurricular activities may also benefit students mental health!

Studies have shown that students enrolled in extracurricular activities have a better self image, Self image can change in a positive way because your peers or adults around you are complimenting your hard work. It may also affect their day to day mood. Their moods might not be feeling sad and empty in the morning or feeling lonely and depressed all day, they can change to being happy and hyper in the morning and having a positive attitude all day long! It can also make students happier because they have something to look forward to. Student surveys around the world say that when you have something to look forward to can bring up your happiness almost half way!

Extracurricular activities can benefit their mental health by bettering your self image,having more enjoyable and positive moods all day, to being excited to have something to look forward to which is always a big help.

Although, some students may experience the complete opposite of these results!

Some may find themselves having more work and less time to spend doing some of the things they love. It is sometimes hard for young people to balance out a good amount of time to study and do homework with a good amount of time to sleep or hang out with friends or family. Their grades could start to suffer more because of the amount of stress they may begin to have.

Still, these hardships could be a learning experience for students and could even help them become a better person and a hard working citizen as they grow into adults. Everyone faces hard times in their lives, these may seem like the end of the world to students but really, it is just the universes way of teaching them of many more hardships they will come across in life, the universe may be trying to teach them how to deal with things like this and advising them to never give up..

Even though students may experience feelings of too much stress or depression, it's important to help them if they feel this way and get them on the path to getting better grades and certainly a much better mental health! They may even learn from these experiences as well!

Extracurricular activities are very fun and have great effects on students ranging from getting a better, more clear, self image and mental state, to getting better grades in school and being able to focus for longer periods of time, and who knows, students may even learn a thing or two along the way about life and what becoming a good, hardworking citizen is. They could even get a taste of what adulthood is like!
