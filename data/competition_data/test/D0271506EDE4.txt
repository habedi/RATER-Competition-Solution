Imagine living on a different planet than other humans. Venus once had very Earth like structures. It had very similar charecteristics which almost made it seem humane. NASA should continue to explore Venus because it has a lot of potential and was once similar to earth.

Venus has a lot of potential because if we continue to explore it, we can figure out how to get around how hot it is. We can find a way to change that as long as we keep exploring. Venus once had oceans and was covered with structures like valleys and mountains that we have here on Earth. The risk is high, but the reward is even higher.

Even though we know that this is a very dangerous plan, it could change rates of poverty and would increase jobs here on Earth because people here would leave their jobs. NASA says that they can find ways to do this but it will obviously take some time.
