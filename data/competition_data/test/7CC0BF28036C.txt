Using technology to know expressions of students in a classroom is wrong because the one experiment which Dr. Huang did was on a painting was different and doing it on students is a different thing because it can really affect them in wrong ways. By knowing their emotional expression means playing with their feelings and that could make an huge impact on a students life and in these past mosern years there has never been an technlogical experiment done on a Human or a Student. So I think that it shoud not be done on students because they are the future and playing with them is not a good thing to do and it an also make an huge impact on them because knowing their expressions means knowing them and what they think and but by doing that the students won't even trust themselves on anything and that could it even hurt the students for their life and would be hard for them to come back.
