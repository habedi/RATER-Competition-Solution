Ever had a school project that you had to do over the summer? Ever hated a teacher for making you do it? And I know you think that summer time is to be not focused on school and to have a break but, school is important and so is focusing on it too. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning their break. I believe these summer projects should be teacher designed. They should be teacher designed to get a head start for next year, over the summer our brains just get caught up in the fun and time off, and it would be more challenging to us if a teacher designed it.

First, it is important to head start for the next year. It would feel amazing to be in the top of your class and finally understand everything your teacher was talking about. In doing so, you could even start to tutor your friends and classmates. I don't know about you but, when ever I get a "light bulb" in class or finally I feel like I know what I'm doing is correct, I feel amazing. Imagine having that feeling in that class most of the time! If you had a summer project that a teacher designed, you could get a head start with the materials and may even learn them better in the process.

Secondly, remember during the school year when you would dream about being on a beach or even just being at home having some rest from school? Don't you want summer to last forever? Everyone misses summer at some point, especially when it's blowing snow outside. Also, remember when august comes around and you start to dread about going to school? Yeah me too but, when you have summer projects you can exercise your brain and make it not so hard when you come back to school. I believe if summer projects were student based, nothing would get done. If anything, the bare minimum would get done because kids want to spend time resting and relaxing and not having to worry about anything.

Lastly, it would be more challenging for the students. If you were to make a project over summer, it would be a mess. It would be past due, not done at all, or just not done with enough effort. Most teachers give you this project not to be mean, but to benefit you in the long run. I feel like if a student made a project for themselves, it would not be challenging enough and also, you want a good impression on that teacher that you are hard working and can go through any challenges that may come your way.

Next time you get a project to do over the summer, be thankful and look at the positives from it. Mostly the teacher isn't trying to be mean and try to "ruin your summer" so, don't think of it in that way. You can be a tutor and get some side money while you are at it, you can make a good impression on your teacher, and many more. So, next time you get a project over the summer that the teacher designed just know they are coming from the right place.
