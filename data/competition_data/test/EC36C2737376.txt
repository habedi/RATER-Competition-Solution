Students want to enjoy their summer break, but when summer projects are assigned, it is hard to do so. Which is why students should be in charge of designing their own summer projects. This will help students develop responsibility as well as keep their minds refreshed on educaton and open doors for different careers.

Firstly, responsibility is a beneficial trait that test one's ability to complete tasks. Giving pupils the ability to create and do projects on their own will strengthen the skill of responsibility. It will help the students further apprciate being able to design their own summer projects.

Secondly, having students in charge of creating projects for themselves keeps their minds refreshed on education. Students tend to forget what they learned from their previous school year during the summer. Allowing students to stay busy during the summer will further prepare them for the upcoming school year.

Thirdly, letting students be in charge of their own proects will more than likely open doors for their future. If some students desire to persue a career in education, they can develop the skills for that career through having control of their own summer projects. They can learn how to assign projects to their future students.

However, many may say that allowing students to be in charge of their summer projects is a bad idea. They infer that the teacher should be in charge of creating the projects due to the experience teachers have over ther students. In contrast, allowing students to create their own projects over teachers alow the students to challenge their brains, therefore, developing their education.

In summary, developing responsibility, opening career paths and keeping an open mind on education are valid reasons for allowing students to design their own summer projects over teachers. Teachers should allow students to be independent and let them be in control of their education. This will lead to a more advanced and updated education for school systems in the future.
