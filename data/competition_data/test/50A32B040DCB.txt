Do you think that the Face on Mars is a natural landform, or do you think that it was created by aliens? The picture of the Face on Mars was captured on May 21, 2001, and a few days later it was shown to the public which got this whole thing started. Most of the people from NASA believed that it was just a natural landform, but conspiracy theorists believed the it was created by aliens on Mars. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper to reveal a natural landform. It was just a huge rock formation which resembled a human face, and the defenders of the NASA budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars because they would benefit off of it.

A few days after the photo of the Face was snapped, they showed it to the public for everbody to see. The NASA team caption the photo with "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth." Some people believe that the Face was created by aliens on Mars. NASA and many scientists believed that it was just another Martian Messa. Martian Messas were common enough around Cydonia.

On April 5, 1998, The MOC team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos. The photo first appeared on the JPL web site, and it revealed a natural land form. Since the Face was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, it was winter at the time they snapped the picture which was in April of 1998. At this time, it was cloudy on the planet Mars, so the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Conspiracy theorists said that maybe the alien markings were hidden behind the haze.

Lastly, the defenders of the NASA budget wished there was ancient civilization on Mars. If aliens did exist and NASA did discover them or signs of them, then NASA would benefit off of it. NASA would most likely send people or some kind of camera to take better pictures and videos of Mars. NASA would not keep it to themselves, they would share it with the public. After all this time survaying and taking pictures of Mars, they have not found alien life form on Mars.

In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform like many others. The Face just happens to be unique because of it's many shadows that make the Face resemble an actual face. Many rock formations happen on the planet of Mars. The Face is no different then the many thers of it's kind. The Face is the most unique and interesting landform found on Mars the is one of the many natural landforms presents on the planet Mars.
