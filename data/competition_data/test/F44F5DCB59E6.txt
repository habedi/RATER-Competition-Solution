I think that students should be allow to bring there phones to school and use them at free times. i believe these is a good idea because kids don't have anything to do and their would more than likely get themselves in trouble for doing some thing they would not have if they had something to do. also what if there a family problem like if some how the house went up in flame the kid who lived in that house would know before other people. Or what if the school was on fire the kid would than be able to call the mom or dad and let them know that the kid is okay. another reason that it is a good idea is because kids tend to listen more when they are happy and phone to say something to your friend across the lunch room is a grate way to keep the kid happy for the rest of the day. on the other hand the kids might be to in to the phone to tern it off for class if this happen a teacher can take it away from the kids that are not following the rules of the school. so i say we should have phones in school just not during class. thank you for listening to what i had to say about the phone debate that our school is having. i hope you see that having phone in school is a grate idea and plan.
