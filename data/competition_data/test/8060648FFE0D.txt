Swish, that is the sound of the basketball going into the net, pow, that is the sound of the gavel going down as people are talking on the student council, and it is the sound of all the students participating in these activities getting smarter as they progress in them. After school activities are often a thing of life for kids. Most parents put their children in after school activities so that the child can grow and have productive things to do. As well as so that the child can learn to accept defeat and cooperate with other people. So if the principle thinks that he should have all kids commit to some after school activity I would support him, so that the children of this school could gain valuable life skills, keep out of trouble, and grow physically and mentally.

Extracurricular activities help students by helping them to grow physically and mentally. For example when you play sports you condition your body physically. As well when you do a mathematical or core subject related activity you grow mentally. And finally when you are on the debate team, or yearbook comity, or even the student council you often grow mentally. This is one of the ways doing after school activities can help kids, but it can also helps children in other ways.

Doing after school activities can keep children out of trouble, and they can help children by giving them something productive to do. Families dont always have a ton of money, and this can cause some families to live in a bad part of town, and that is not what we want for our children so putting these children in after school activities can help keep them out of trouble. As well some children do not have good home lives, and after school activities can often help with this, by keeping them out of that situation as long as possible, and eventually the child might feel comfortable telling a coach or teacher about this who can help that child. Adding to that a lot of children have nothing to do when they get home and will spend hours playing video games or checking social media, and putting them in a extracurricular activities can help balance the time they spend on those devices. So now you some of the ways afterschool activities can help keep students out of trouble, and help them be productive, but there are more ways that after school activities are good for children.

Doing after school activities can also help children build valuable skill that can be used when he or she becomes a adult. Children doing these activities lose one time or another while doing them, and this can teach the child about losing gracefully, and that it is OK to lose. As well in extracurricular activities a child will often be faced with problems and solving them will help the child build good problem solving skills that can be used later in life. To add to that when you do just about any after school activity you have to work in a team to do something, and this will help children build valuable team work skills that he or she will need in just about any profession. These are the reasons why I think that every child should commit do doing at least one after school activity.

There are many reasons why doing after school activities are good. Like the fact that they build good life skills. As well as that extracurricular activities give children something productive to do. And finally they help children grow physically and mentally. So for these reasons I agree that all children should be required to do after school activities.
