hello, state senator, i argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. there aree many things wrong with it. voters dont actually vote for a slate of electors, who elect whos the president. the elctors could be anyone not holding office. voters cant always vote for their electors either.

the single best arguement againt the electoral college is the disaster factor. faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their parties canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

perhaps maybe there was a tie in the electorial vote. this is considered the most worring of all. the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

at the most basic level, this is unfair to voters.. because of the winner takes all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states.

as to end this argument, i have to say the electorial college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.
