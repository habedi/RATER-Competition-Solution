Dear principal,

I don't think you should make us do that because what if we cant get a B average and then SCHOOL_NAME wants to play a volleyball game against us. What will you do then tell them we cant make it because we don't have a B average. They will just call us chickens and that's not very cool at all. All the kids in this school wouldn't like you because of that. I think you should at less let it go to a C average, please. All the kids at the school will like you then. If you say no to this very important letter, at least give us something to do for us everyday. Like some school's will let us have a snack line in the cafeteria and a Hot Spot at the very end of the day. Eight grade on Monday, seventh on Tuesday, sixth on Thursday, fifth on Friday's.

We will be very thankful for all the things you've done for us. We'll try to get a B average.

If you want to know if I am a B average student, of course I am what kind of dad will let their children have bad grades. They would beat me to deaf, and then ground me on top of that. I got to many personal things I love to much to be taking away. Yea, I wouldn't be getting my permanent at sixteen and I wouldn't get a job either. See what I'm getting to, let us have some free time and let us be able to play in sports at least.

If we don't have the money to get the equipment by buying things like candy, or food at the Hot Spot. You could sell year books for ten dollars a book.

Thanks, Student

P.S. Just let us have sports in the school with at least a

C average.

P.S.S. We love the Hot Spot and the Snack Line.
