Summer break is a fantastic get away for many teenagers; however, it's important that teenagers keep their minds refreshed about the concepts they have learned during the school year. A variety of teenagers struggle to study on their own. I believe teacher designed summer projects are an excellent way to keep minds refreshed and learn more detailed information about past or future concepts.

Teacher designed projects may provide an outline for the students to follow. Personally, outlines tremendously help me stay on the right track. Teacher designed projects may also provide a topic for students. Starting off on my own is challenging. Many students, including myself, need a starting point to proceed with the rest of the project.

Teacher designed projects gives students the ability to learn more in debth about topics depending of the requirements they ask for. I usually learn the basics of different topics. If i'm not required to look up topics more in debth, I would most likely skim through the project instead of really knowing the topic.

Teachers have learned different topics and concepts before their teaching career. They have experienced learning and maybe even teaching for many years. Since teachers have learned these topics already, they should provide the information you need to include. I include information I don't need because I don't have any backround knowledge of what I need to include. A teachers job is to guide students.

Several schools require teenagers to complete summer projects. Some teenagers rather have student based projects; however, I believe teacher based projects are a great way to keep students minds refreshed becuase they provide an outline for students to stay on track, an ability to master topics more in debth, and provide necessary information needed to understand different topics.
