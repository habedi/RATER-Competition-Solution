Dear Principal,

I think this is outrages for our student body to comply to this new policy you have us commit to. Don't you see that most of our students have a C average. Your not going to have a complete team if this policy goes in affect. Having a C average is a good average to go by. There are kids, good kids that can't really pull off a B average but can get through with a C average. That's not fair for the student to have to do excellent just to be in school activities. Having a C average to be in school activities is a well enough policy and shouldn't be touched. There are kids who fail classes and work there butts off to get a C average to be in school sports which is not easy for them. So I ask you in behalf off our student body to not change this policy and leave it just how it's been and how it's always been.
