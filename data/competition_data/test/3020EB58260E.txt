As we all know, summer is just about every kid's favorite season. Why is that? They have no school. They don't have to worry about waking up at six o'clock every morning; just to go and deal with nagging teachers all day, and come home and stay up until midnight doing homework. Summer is a break, and a much needed one. Kids get to have fun, hang out with their friends, and go on vacation.

But, there is one thing kids dread about summer break: summer projects. They don't have to be as hated, though. Only reason they are so disliked is because it's the same thing every year. If we gave kids a choice on what they did, if we let them design their own projects, they will be more inclined to do them and do them well. Kids like to be in control, and if we let them think they are, they will prosper. Also, creating their own projects gives them a new way to learn and prepares them for life ahead.

If students create their own projects, they will be more interested and more likely to actually do it. Kids like to be in control, and if they think they are, they will be encouraged to to put real effort in. I remember when I was ten, my parents told me I finally had to start doing chores. I didn't want to, of course, no kid does. But then, my parents came to me with a proposition. If I created my own list of chores, with reasonable prices and a good schedule, I could execute chores in that manner. I liked the fact that they gave me the responsibility; they gave me the choice to pick and choose, and I felt encouraged to do my chores. Summer projects are no different. When given a task, and a choice kids will more likely get the work they needed to be done. Along with how giving kids a choice will make them more interested, it will also help them prepare for life ahead. For the rest of their life, kids will be given a task and told to execute it however they please, in college and in their work field. Adding summer reading to the list of things students will be creating on their own will only prepare them for later on.

Students will have to do summer projects regardless. It is the only thing to keep their brain fresh, and to have the ability to retain everything they have learned. Giving them a choice just encourages them to do it well and prepares them for their future. While others may say: giving students a choice won't let the project be done correctly or it migh be off track; students will still get some type of learning in, and they did it on their own.Â
