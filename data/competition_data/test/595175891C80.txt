Not needing anymore cars in the future ? that would be awsome and you could just teleport? that sounds so fun but scary at the same time. this really would change the world a lot.

Another thing would be cars with out people needing to drive on the drivers seat. such as like getting in a taxi, you just tell the car where you would like to go and where its locatced at just like you would to the man in the taxi. exept this time you dont have to pay your car for the distance it drove you just like you would pay a taxi man/woman.

This car would have to be like a ohone in order to drive its self but more technalgy put into it , because it has to have sencers so it will not hit another car that it is in front, side or behind you. and also it will need to have a very very advanced gps that will be have to be updated everytime there would be traffic, road blocks, road floding, construction on the road that is getting fixed, where all the new reaturants that have been just barley been built and open for service. This car need so much things installed to it for it will need to be perfect but not also is it just the car that will probably need to have things installed to it, also we would need to install chips on the stop lights. so there for the car can know when the light is on green to go, yellow to slow down for a stop, and red to atomaticlly stop. it would need to signal the car and give it a message letting it know what color the stop light know so there for it would give the car time to react to what it is instructed to do.

I was thinking, what if we had to install sincers on to or into the road so there for the car will not go off road and it will know what lane it has to stay on or take. then also guss what ? we would have to also maybe install sincers to the speed limit sign to where it will notificate the car how fast it should be going on the road or how fast it should be turnning on a certain road.

Know you see all the stuff we will need to do in order for people to have a car that will drive itself? this will cost a lot of money ! i mean a lot ! because you would have to bulid all of that and install all of that to the whole untied states ! thats a lot of money just for a car that drives itself. its cool but i mean this will only make people lazy to not drive at all. In my opinion, this is a very bad idea when we really dont need it.
