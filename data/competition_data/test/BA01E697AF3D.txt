Luke Bomberger was a man who had no idea that he would go to different countries when his friend asked him if he would like to go with him to Europe and China and he didn't want to say no because it was a once in a lifetime thing so he said yes and he experienced a lot when he went to China and Europe when he met poor people like France,Belgium,Denmark,Poland and many more including China and other countries. When he realized that the other countries were going to have a community of law inforcment Luke was excited because the countries were recovering from war! It took them 2 weeks to get to Europe and it took 1 month to get to China. When Luke got to China he was suprised how it was there plus some areas were taken by the Japanese meanwhile the rest of China was in pretty good shape but they still had to take care of the mess that happened in the war by the Japanese. When Luke was still in Europe the countries had a lot of buildings damaged and a lot of people died due to being a jew or romaine but when things were recovering the communities in the countries got better. Soon after Luke got back home safely he realized that not everyone has a home or shelter and it made him think more of people and himself also so now he gets how the war was in Europe and China so he was glad that he had a home and fodd and shelter. After a couple years later Europe and China got better afterwards plus it became a better community also China got better after the war ended. Before war started by the Germans and Italians Europe was a normal country and Japan,Korea,and China were normal also before Japan got involed with war and now things are recovering but some are still hurt about what happened during the war but its over and the community got better over the years and Luke finally understands and now e got closer to people that have no homes and to himself also.
