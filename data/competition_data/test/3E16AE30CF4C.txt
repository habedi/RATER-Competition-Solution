Google has made a new improved car that does not require a driver. I am against the project that Google came up with recently. Google cofounder Sergey Brin beleives that the future can have a transportation system without a human driver. So far, Google cars aren't truly driverless because they still alert the driver to take over when dealing with complicated traffic issues. This makes me think that I am not safe when I'm in the car.

The development of these cars require many sensors that can be really expensive. Google made a Toyota Prius that used a sensor on the left rear wheel, a sensor on the roof, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. This is a total of eight different types of sensors including other important technology for only one vehicle. They combined many necessary inputs for the driverless car "to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel." These driverless cars still need assistance of a human. No type of technology can mimic the skill of a human.

Some people ask why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver ? Manufacturers are hoping to bring an "in-car entertainment" system. This is a safetly concern because many accidents happen on the road and a driver shouldn't be anymore distracted especially knowing that they are not personally driving. The passengers in the car and pedestrians surrounding the car should be more careful as well especially when the driverless car can not handle a complicated traffic issue.

The lawmakers know that safety is achieved when the driver is alert. The driving laws focus on keeping the drivers and passengers safe. In most states it is illegal to test a computer driven car because they do not rely on the safetyness of the driverless car. Even if the driverless cars were to be approved and legal that only means that new laws will be needed. If technology were to fail and an accident happened it will be complicated to blame the driver or the manufacturer. Automakers can continue with their projects with these cars but I personally think that technology can not mimic the skills of a human.
