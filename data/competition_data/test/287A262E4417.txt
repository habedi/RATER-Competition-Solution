I strongly disagree with your decision you are making because there are many students with a C average that do not get in trouble, and are very good at sports. If this rule is pass there would be very few students playing sports because the would not be allowed to because of their grades are not meeting the goal that they are supposed to meet to join an after school activity or a sport.

These students do not deserve this decision because if their grades do not meet the standards that they need to join the team that means they will not be able to play the sports they love for their school. I think that you should have the grading standards at least be an C+ so their not in average they are in an high C category so they will be able to play their sports they enjoy doing and still be able to make good grades so there is a smile on the students face as well as the school boards.

It will Also lead to another major issue student that do not join the team leads up to no players in the game so then our school will not be able to participate with a basket ball games, football games or any other sports or after school activities that our school represents. I understand where you are coming from with raising the grading scale for sports because you want to help these students succeed in life and want their Grade Point Average to stay over a three point zero but some students just can not succeed in this expectation.

It is just not fair to me because these good students that try so hard to join this team and can not because of your legit actions, so i disagree with your decision. So I am writing this on behalf of all of my peers to say that just is not fair, i hope you hear me out and understand my point of view so you can see how it affects us students. Thank you for your time and hope you change your mind.
