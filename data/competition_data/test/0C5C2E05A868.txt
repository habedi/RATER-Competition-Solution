Yes, Facial Action Coding System is great way to see how students feel, because not everyone shows there emotions. FACS is going to help many students when they show how they feel. For example, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." It will help to develop better ways for people and computers to communicate.

How FACS works it starts with a 3-D model of a persons face it will have 44 muscles in the model and they have to move like human muscles. FACS technology will show a persons emotions like happy, mad, surprised, angry, sad, and scared. It will know when you move a muscle, and it can detect what emotion the person is doing. For example, "your frontalis lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger". This Technology is safe and will be very useful for many people.

In conclusion, FACS will develop more and it will help many students in school, home, and just in general. This technology will be very useful and very productive. Facial Action Coding System will develop better ways for people and computers to communicate.
