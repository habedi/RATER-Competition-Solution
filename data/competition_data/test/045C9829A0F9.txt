Imagine not being able to go to school and see your friends. Although you might feel comfortable at home,doing your school work from home can be a big distraction rather than doing your work at school. Some schools allow students to attend classes at home but doing than can cause laziness and can be disturbing to the brain. Students should not be allowed to attend classes at home because, students might get more distracted if they do their work from home, students might understand better if their at school, and you can get physical help from your teacher.

To begin with, allowing students to do there class work from home can be distracting. For example, Generic_Name has really good grades and his behavior is astonishing so his counselor and his teacher decided since this was happening he could take his classes from home. Generic_Name and his parents thought this was a great idea until two weeks later when his teacher and parents started to see his grades drop. Generic_Name's parents were beginning to think it was his teachers fault, but it was Generic_Name's fault, he was so distracted by video games and other things he didnt really make time to do his school work. So if Generic_Name would have stayed in school his grades would have looked the same.

Another reason, students might understand better. There are some students who might not understand something, but there to scared or shy to come out and say it. so allowing those who dont really talk to stay at home and take there classes at home what makes you think that they want to be stared at through the computer. For example Generic_Name is a very shy person but she gets her work done. She often struggles with her class work she feels that if she takes her classes through a computer screen it will attract more attention to her an she would be laughed at.

Then, you can get physical help from your teacher. There is nothing wrong with getting help from your teacher, but even then if you take your classes at home how is the teacher going to help you it would be harder for the teacher to because, she might not know what you need help on. You might feel like your going to disturb the class just to ask for help from a computer screen.

So although schools might think it would be better to take your classes at home remember that, students might get more distracted if they work from home, students might understand better, and you can get physical help from your teacher.
