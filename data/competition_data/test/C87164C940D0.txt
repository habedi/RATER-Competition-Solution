Dear, Principle

I think that students should be able to choose weather they want to do community service or not. Its not fair to just make the whole school do community service, because that is how you feel. Some students may have very important places to go or things to do for example, they might have to go to a therapy for a sickness or go see they're dad who they haven't seen since they were five years old. Don't get me wrong I see where your coming from, but not everybody feels the same way about the community. Just think of how many students would do the wrong without adult supervision. Most students would do bad things just because, that's just how they are.

It would cause to many problems then you would have to call their parents and explain why you have just let their child leave school. If they found an important item, they probably wouldn't tell an adult what they found. It could be money, a ring, maybe even your car keys from three month's ago. The students start yelling or playing loud music and interrupt some bodies nice evening. Which would cause many complaints. Students that play around to much could get hit by an on coming vehicle. Then, you would be accountable for their medic bill. Their parents could try to sue our school for money we may not have and then you will be fired. It wont be fun at home with no job just watching T.V. getting fat off of ice cream and cookie dough. A lot of kids would be sad, because you are good principle who everybody likes and to see you go would make us sad. If we had to go to a different school with teachers we don't know or may not like us our grades could drop tremendously.

The kids you have known since sixth grade may drop out as where you have made us happy to even think about school. I think community service would be a good idea if they could on they're own time, but since your going to make all the students do it you may take time out of their day. Worst of all some students may not even show up which could be a waste of your time. I feel that you should think about this very hard and that you need to think about how many consequences would be this project.

Sincerely,
