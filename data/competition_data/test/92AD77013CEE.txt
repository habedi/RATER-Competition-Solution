Mr. principal,

I believe making students do community service wouldn't be a good idea. Yes it is helpful to the community but it would have to be an outside of school assignment and many parents wouldn't be very thrilled about that. Some families do not have the money to take their kids places for community service or have the time. On top of homework, chores, and family things some students may feel overwhelmed. Then if it did not get done then it may mean an A or an F for that student making the student feel even more overwhelmed. The school would also have to take extra time to assign and organize the community service on top of their regular schedule.

An outside of school program for community service i believe would be a good idea. It would be like any other club or sport outside of school and students can take it willingly. If the students see that its easy to sign up and help out then i believe that more kids would help. Instead of adding stress onto the teachers and students day it would be easier to give the students and option. Not all students have time for community service but those who truly want to, have a chance.
