My fellow scientist thinks that there is life on Mars because of the "human face" that was found on Mars in 1976, but I can give him three reasons why there isn't any life on Mars and that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform. One reason is that the "face", based on the 2001 photo, looks a lot like landforms on Earth. My second reason is that if there was any chance that there was life on Mars NASA would keep it to themselves. My final reason is that Cydonia has many other known mesas, why would this one be special?

In 1976 and 1998 I do admit it does look a little bit like a face, but in 2001, with the better graphics, the "face" looks nothing like a face. In 1976 it was very popular because it made people believe in life on Mars, but with the enhanced graphics the popularity of this "face" went down because people started realizing that it was not a face. Also, it looks almost the exact same as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

If this "face" was made by aliens, NASA would more than likely keep it to themselves. If NASA were to tell this to the public saying that it was an extraterrestrial made landform, the whole entire world would freak out. They would most likely be terrified of the aliens. Another reason is since the United States' NASA found this they wouldn't want other countries to know about this, so we could be the ones to discover life on Mars beforwe the rest of the world.

In the region of Cydonia on Mars, there are a lot of other mesas and buttes. Why would this one be any different? If Martians made a mesa that looks like a face, why would they put it around other mesas. They would most likely put in a region that doesn't draw attention to keep there life a secret.

In conclusion, the "face" on Mars is just a natural landform because it looks like landforms on Earth, Cydonia has a lot more known mesas, so this is another of its many mesas, and last but not least, NASA would never tell the world that there is extraterrestrial life on Mars.
