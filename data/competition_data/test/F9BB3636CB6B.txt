Dear Principal,

It would be a major change in schools to raise the eligibility requirements for sports.

As a student and major athlete i think it would be a good idea to go through with this new policy. The raise on grade averages will make student athletes work harder in the classroom and at home. Having a grade average of a C and changing it to a B is a little bit of a change. I think that it would benefit the student in a lot of different areas. It would help them become a harder worker and put effort into what they do. If a student really cares for there sport and wants to excel in there skills, they will put forth the time to make there grade average better. Raising the grade requirements for student athletes will show teachers and educated adults how much of an improvement that they can make in just a short period of time. Changing this policy will help students in two different ways; in there grades and in there sport.

Students that have a hard time getting good grades will have to work a lot harder to achieve the academic goal of a B on average. Just because you don't get good grades now, doesn't mean that you can't in the future. By changing this policy it will give the lower academic students a chance do just as well as a very high academic student. Just asking a teacher for help you can make yourself a better student and meet the requirements. Having a lower grade average will make it a struggle for the athlete to keep there grades up, but if you have a passion for sports nothing can get in the way of that. Being a athlete with bad grades but a high skill level for your sport will motivate you more to get your grades up and have success in what you do. For me personally if the grade policy got changed it would just make me want to work harder, which would create academic achievement as well as a higher skill level. Changing the policy will also ,make better teamwork, where they will know that there team has made the grade requirements. Overall raising the grade requirements and changing the school policy will benefit student athletes in many different ways.

Sincerely,
