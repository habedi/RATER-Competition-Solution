Luke Bomberger had got asked to join this program called '' Seagoing Cowboys."

He was working at two part time jobs, one of the jobs were grocery store and the other one was the bank. Then, Lukes friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to the cattle boat in Europe. Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called "Seagoing Cows" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned 18 when he was onthe cattle boat headed towrds Greece, and that meant he could be drafted to the military services! By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had made nine trips, then he got told that he had the most Seagoing Cowboys trips in the program!

Luke always said "the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy!" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. He enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up his world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help. A good reason for joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is because you can relize how you have good towns and good houses and some countries don't have that. It shows how you canbe helpful and you need to be greatful for what you have and dont have!
