Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Have you ever drove down the street and seen trash along the side of the road? Well our school is thinking about making every student help clean this up or do some kind of other community service in our town. I'm going to tell you why i think this may help through out our town but its not a good idea to require every student to do community service.

One reason why i think this isn't a good idea is because this can interfere with peoples schedule. For example if a student had a baseball game on a Saturday afternoon and he couldn't go because he had to go and do a community service. Now while this may help out our city the student won't be happy to be there and he may not put forth the effort that he should. So if you want people to be happy to be there then don't interfere with there schedule.

Another reason why this isn't a good idea is because this may interfere with personal activities. For example if a student had a family reunion in a different city and he had to go and couldn't perform a community service and when he got back to school he got in trouble because he didn't do a community service during the school year. So if you don't want kids to get in trouble because they missed there day then don't require a community service.

One last reason why i don't think this is a good idea is because this can interfere with a students school work. For example if a student hadn't performed a community service by the end of the school year and they were busy thinking about that and they weren't focused on the lesson in his class. It could also stress the student out.

so in conclsusion this could in
