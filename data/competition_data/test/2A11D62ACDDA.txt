In my opinion the use of using technology to detect exactly how other people feel is a technology that can be very useful. Especially when it covers one of the most important parts of identifying how someone may really feel and not just what they may be able to let out. The article even states this software that can be used from a computure that percisely can add up percentages of the different ways your mood may be at the time. The percentages can go from how happy, suprised, angry, ddisgusted, fearful, or sad you may be. All this comes from a computer that thats puts together a 3-D model of the face and can develop action unit which the article states means the movement of one or more muscles.

Not only from what the article says and covers all the pros of why this idea would be useful, i belive this idea would maybe make this world a bettter place. with one accpetion not just anyone can i dentify your expression only ones whom you may feel confortble with letting out to. More ways this can be helpful is because when people hold things in it may cause them to hurt also the people aroung them close ones and now they wouldnt have to worry anymore.
