Summer projects are a great way to keep students brains thriving during the summer-time. They are designed to keep people on their toes, and so they dont develop a terrible work ethic that will reflect in their following school year. summer projects are an incredible resource as it is, but the question is should they be created by the students? or the Teachers? summer projects should be teacher-designed because summer-time can be very busy for students, teachers know the best information to feed students for the following year, and It will make students more obligated to complete them.

Some people may argue that students will be more enthusiastic about school projects if they get to choose the topics themselves. However, students need guidance or else the will not make them a priority. Instead of it feeling like school work it will feel like a side project that doesn't really matter. For example, my cousin goes to a private school where they allow the students to choose their summer projects. He got an F on all of them simply because he did not feel like he it was a priority and pushed it off until the very last minute.

Students are WAY to busy in the summer to create their own projects in the summer. One reason is that most students get summer jobs which take up a lot of their time. For example my friend Generic_Name is a Full Time Life Guard. he works 40 hours a week. He would have not have enough time to design a whole project and work a full time job without putting himself into serious mental strain. It is hard to balance out that much. Another point is that many people go on vacation with their families during summer. For example, my mother and I go on vacation to Generic_City every summer. This is important because people want to use the extra time they have when not doing the project and spend it with their families. Not making spending it creating the project they have to complete.

Teachers know the best information to give you to prepare you for next year. If school projects are student-designed, students won't cover material that will set them up for success. It's a teachers job to prepare you on what is to come, so why not let them do it? the school projects will become irrelevant simply because they are going to cover topics that will benefit them in the long run. They are not going to take seriously.

Students will feel more obligated to complete the projects if they are created by teachers. If students are given the freedom to just do the whole thing on their own, they will nine times out of ten just not do it at all. The reason for this is because it does would not feel like school work therefore it will not feel important. an example of this is after school activities like theater. In theater you are given things to memorize at home, but some people do not do it simply because they feel it is not as important as other things they could be doing. They are not prioritizing and that is exactly what will happen if we make summer projects students designed; people will not not feel obligated to do it there they won't.

To wrap it all up summer projects truly should be teacher- designed. Summer activities take up a lot of these kids time, so they will not have time to create them on their own. Also teachers know what the best things are to assign to help them with the next school year. Finally students need to be guided so that they will prioritize their summer work. Please encourage you administrator to make more teacher-designed summer projects. It will make a huge difference in how helpful the projects are to these students.
