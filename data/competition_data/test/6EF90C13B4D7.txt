Dear Principal,

You may think that all students need to perform community service ,but in reality they don't have to if they don't want to. Some students choose not to do community service because they want to do it others probably have things to or they just don't want to do them. You can not make students perform community service hours if they don't want to it is against the law and it's against school policy to make them do something they don't want to do. As me coming from the bottom of my heart you should not force students to do community service hours if they don't want to and if they do fine let them go ahead and do it .You cant make them perform something that they will not be pleased to do unless there parents make them do community service hours, but all in all you can not force students to do community service hours. If you want students to do community service hours you should have a meeting to see how they feel about it and you should tell them how you think it will benefit them because if not its just a waste of time for you trying to get children to do community service hours especially if they already have things to do after school or if they have some type of job awaiting. As a student myself I highly don't think it is fair for you to make kids perform community service hours while there under the impression that it will better help them when in reality you just want them to do it just to do it. Some people already help the community some already clean up the liter so by forcing them to do more community service they are just going to say forget it and that I'm done with this. By forcing students to do community service hours they are going to lose respect for you and they will just blow you off once you ask them to do something or if you ask them to give you something. You should not force students to community service hours if they don't want to at all its just wrong and its mean to force them into something they wouldn't want to do.

Sincerely ,
