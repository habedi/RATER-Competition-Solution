First off, we can not say it was an alien who creater these human-like faces. We can't prove it was an alien at this time, because we haven't even figured out if aliens even exist! It most likey was a nautural landform, because over time, rock formation could've combined all together to create this face-like figure on mars.

Next, this is obviously a landform, and not created by aliens, because, during those cases, there was no alien monument after all! Also, on April 5, 1998, thousands of web users were anxiously waiting for the very first image on a JPL web site, which seemed to reveal that it was actually a natural landform.

Next, not everyone was happy with the results of it being a natural landform and not created by a alien. The "face on Mars" became such a big deal, it was in films, magazines, books, radio shows, and most likely your checkout line at your local grocery store!

Fourth, many people were wondering why NASA didn't just hide the discoveries of the life on Mars. Conspiracy theorists say "life on Mars", evidence that NASA workers would have rather hide to prevent too many questions on the face.

To conclude, maybe it was all just a huge rock formation, since aliens have no evidence that they actuslly exist, or have been seen by a human. So what do you think? Do you think aliens may have created this landform, or was it just a natural lanform?
