In my opinion I think cell phones shouldn't be used while driving because it has a big impact on the people. It has bad causes such as people getting into life threatening wrecks and people can't just focus on the road. People use them to text while driving and they thousands die because of it every year. It has a terrible impact on today's society because we can't put phones down.

Phones are not good to the public because people can't focus on the road and the environment surrounding them. Even though you can call the authorities with a swipe of a finger, they are the reason they get into the wrecks. I feel like if you have an emergency you should pull over instead of stopping and causing a wreck. People just don't think about the outcome of using phones while driving. People only don't have to look out for themselves but other drivers.

Phones not only distract us from the road but from our day to day life. They distract us from spending time with our families and friends. It also distracts us from watching movies. It distracts us from just the good moments we have and share. Phones are a very distracting thing to our lives and they need to be put down for a bit so we can have some actual time to ourselves. Everyone sticks to social media now and it just isn't good.

In Conclusion phones are no good to us and our day to day life. I think people shouldn't text and drive or just be on their phones in general because it could be fatal to your health if you get a wreck or just looking at your surroundings.
