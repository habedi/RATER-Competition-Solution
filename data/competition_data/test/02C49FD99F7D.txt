Education is one of the main building blocks of a persons life and we have spend many years in school from elementary to college or less to have our education, one thing about schools is that they haven't changed throughout the century; however, schools should be evolving as our technology does. As a student, attending classes at home via online or video conferencing would be more benefiting than attending class in school; students can learn from the comfort of their home, save problems with transportation, and even be safer for their health.

Students have been forced out of their beds to leave the comfort of their house to attend a school where they might not enjoy or feel out of place. Due to the uncomfortable feeling students can feel embarrassed to ask questions that might sound "stupid" or feel uncomfortable with eyes watching them, this can be solved by online classes. Since no one will be face to face there is almost no judgment, one can simply type in a question and wait for the teacher to answer. From my experience, I always feel bad or dumb if I try asking a question, so from my perspective as a student I'd be more comfortable knowing I'm asking a question through a screen and not face to face where I'd feel embarrassed. Classes in a comfortable environment at home can also allow people, like moms, to still care for their baby when the child needs their mother, verses a mother having to skip classes and fall behind in order to care for the child. Students can also simply get out of bed (or stay in it) and turn on a computer to get to class instead of having to wake up an hour or so and dress, they can easily access the classes and save them their sleep.

Another pro to the online classes instead of in school classes is there is no transportation involved with online classes. From my own personal knowledge with talking with college students, like my sister, I know that most colleges do not allow freshmen students to drive their own cars on campus which can cause problems with getting to their class if they live in a far dorm or are renting a home. Online classes can solve the problems of transportation that include: bus fare, less sleep, missing the bus, and saving overall can money to those students who need to pay for a cab, Uber, or a bus. Transportation is sometimes not accessible to everyone and can be a financial problem for some families/students, online classes can help with saving money on transportation and can make going to school easier for students with transportation issues. As for those who take a bus either in college or below, students may have to wake up even earlier to catch a bus, this can cut young students sleeping time which is necessary to the natural growth in humans. Some students might miss the bus and not have another way to school, while other might have to buy bus fares to even get to school. Meanwhile, with online classes students can learn from their homes or another comfortable environment without having to worry about transportation in general.

A final example of why online classes would be better than in school classes would be the safety issues regarding a classes in school. One of the safety issues caused by schools are the viruses that can spread fast in a crowded area, like in a compact school building. Students will be unsafe from these fast spreading viruses, especially now that we have COVID-19, the new virus with no vaccine that spreads fast and can become deadly in worst cases scenarios. Schools around the world have shut down and changed to online classes in some countries due to the safety of their students being more mandatory then having to be present for roll in school classes. Other issues with safety in schools not online would be the school shooters that have been on the rise recently. Student will feel safer at home then in school where there is probably only one officers that protect the whole school building from a school shooter, there had been already dozens of cases where there were more people injured before emergency services could stop the gunner. Schools want students safe before anything else, isn't that correct?

In conclusion, there should be online classes replacing in school classes since they're more comfortable and convenient for students, can save money and transportation, and is overall safer for the students. Some might argue that online classes are only made for students who are lazy and don't want to try to advance their education; although, that can be argued with all students don't all have the same resources to be able to attend a in school class, there very much so can be geniuses or just students that want to learn who just don't have the luxury or time to take those in school classes, not everyone is blessed. Online classes can be scheduled to work with a students schedule and not against it, they can be more convent for those with families or financial/transportation issues as well make students feel safer. All in all, the idea of online classes are concluded to be more accessible and overall better then those classes in schools.
