People are planning to make driverless cars thanks to thee technology we now have. However, how are you going to teach your children how to drive when these cars come out? How are they going to get their license if they don't know how to drive? Lets not forget that technology can also malfunction at any time.

People have been talking about creating driverless cars and have those be the cars of the future. Right now there are many teenagers learning how to drive. They want to be able to pass the test to get their permit/license. If the cars were to come in now, there would be no point in teaching them how to drive if the cars do it for them. There is a small point while driving where the driver actually has to drive themselves, but that would be hardly ever depending on the situation.

Money is also another situation on our hands. These cars aren't just made of scrap. They need the high-end technology that the car would need in order for the dream to be accomplished. That technology comes with a price. It stated in the story that there was a device named Radar that was placed on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars itself. That's more than buying a single car that is set and ready for you to buy yourself.

The technology used might be high-end, but it also isn't perfect. There can be a malfunction at any time with the sensors and everything that's mentioned in the text. Technology isn't always a reliable source for everyone. There can always be a glitch, and everything blows over. What would happen if the car were to malfunction, and that was to cause an accident? That definitely wouldn't be a good thing.

These are a few reasons as to describe my position as against driverless cars. People wouldn't be able to learn how to properly drive a car, money doesn't grow from trees in order to help create these cars, and technology isn't our best source when anything can happen to it. Although it may seem cool to have those cars come in the future, not everything is as it seems.
