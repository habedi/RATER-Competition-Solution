Some reasons the face is a natural land form is,there was a close up picture taken of it in 200,After the image was pixilized it was proven that there were no buildings around or in the face.

In 2001 there was a close up picture taken of the face. it confirmed there was no alien life, " Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform(7)." In the picture the face isn't very defined like a statue would be, there are only shadows where land forms like rocks are making the illusion of a face.

A few people were not happy with the picture, saying that there could be alien markings on it, or a shack. So scientists got a pixilated picture of it, showing every detail of the face," It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Gavin.(12)" So, it is in fact a natural land form. Before it was probably a rock, or hill. If a person back in that time had the technology to see it they would have seen something not yet weathered down. But now after centuries we see a face.

In conclusion the face is a natural land formmation. That is proven by picture and logic. It is not defined enough to be made by aliens.
