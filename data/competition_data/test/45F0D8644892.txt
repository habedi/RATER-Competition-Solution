Dear TEACHER_NAME,

We heard that if we don't have a B average we can't participate in school sports or clubs. We also heard that you are wanting to hear our side. We see why you are doing this but, we all cant acquire a B average because we try so hard to keep our grades up for our parents. Sometimes we do make mistakes and we make an F on a test . Some students heard i was righting a letter to you about this . They specifically ask me to beg you that they try to learn but they never learn any thing. I think we need your help and maybe in the future we can change it. Also if you did change it most of us would not be able to participate. I see were you are coming from and i don't believe we need that right now. Again thank you from wanting to hear from our point of view.

Sincerely from us,

Your students
