Ugh! Sigh! Thats the sound of boredom from a child. They are unhealthy, have know friends and no imagination, but that can all change. On the other hand you could be playing some exciting and amazing sports. I agree that students should participate and be involved with at least one extracurricular activity.

Exercise is a really great thing and your kids should have a lot of it. From doing a sport for an extracurricular activity this would really benefit the amount of exercise the students get. The students would get in really good shape if they kept doing it. The number of obese kids in the United States is higher than ever because, kids are not getting enough exercise. Playing a sport helps your health out. It helps your cholesterol, your heart rate goes up, and it gets your blood flowing. This can also result in weight loss. I know the boys will love to show off their muscles to the girls. Showing how much weight they have lost and showing them how ripped they are. Besides that, think how much fun you will get to have. You never know you could possibly get really good at the sports and make it to the professional league.

What if your not really into sports. Well then yearbook is definitely the place for you. You get to work with hardworking and creative people to make the best yearbook ever! Working in yearbook benefits you in some many different and exciting ways. It helps you develop your creativity and imagination skills. You get to be part of the amazing creation of the school yearbook. You get to help customize and decorate it to make it look mind-blowing! Working with people in yearbook help you communicate and socialize with other amazing people. You can create ideas and combine them with your fellow workers. If you have an idea for yearbook, don't be shy come out and share it with us.

Doing and extracurricular activity helps your social skills and helps make or meet new friends. I don't know anybody that wants to live their life all alone. That's why doing and activity helps you communicate an with new people that could eventually someday be best friends. Extracurricular activities benefit you in helpfulness, acts of kindness, and most importantly friendships.

An Extracurricular course could benefit you in so many was. It helps your exercise,sociability, and creativity. I agree that students should participate and be involved with the activities. I think that most students wil enjoy it others will not. That's what life is not all people agree or decide on the same thing.
