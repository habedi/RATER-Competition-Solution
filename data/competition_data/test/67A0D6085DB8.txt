Luke is trying to get other people/friends to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

He asks his brother John to join.

"It's a lot of fun," I said.

"You get to explore and go around the world to see places that you've never seen before.

The best part is that you get to go and help others who don't have a lot of supplies."

"I don't know." says John quietly.

"I just don't want to be away from home, and something bad could happen to Mom and Dad.

I'm just not sure about this one," says John.

"You're right," I said.

"You're just not willing enough to help others in need.

Who am I kidding.

You would never want to actually go exploring with your brother.

You would never want to leave your job for awhile.

You juat can't handle it."

"Hey, who said that I couldn't handle it?

I just don't want something bad to happen while I'm gone.

You never know what could happen.

Mom and Dad are getting older you know.

They don't know what's best for themselves."

"Hey Luke, John,"says Mom.

"Why are you kids fighting?

You could have just asked me what you wanted, instead of fighting all the time."

"It's nothing, Mom." says John.

"We can handle this one."

"Come on, John.

Just tell me.

I can give you an answer."

John is silent.

"Ok fine." He says quietly.

"You know that Seagoing Cowboys program Luke goes to?"

"Ya I've heard of that wonderful program," replies Mom.

"Well, Luke wants me to go with him on his next trip.

I'm just not ready to leave you guys yet.

You will need help around the house, and you'll probably miss me."

"John, your 18.

You can leave your dad and I, I promise you that we will be okay.

We have eachother, and we have our wonderful neighbors to help us with any task." Replies Mom.

"I told John that it is a trip of a lifetime," I exclaimed.

You will never forget the moments that we have together.

If you come with me, it will make me feel stronger.

I'll have you by my side the whole time.

We can help others in need together.

John, just please agree and come join me for this one.

We will never forget the experience."

"Well, I suppose so." said John, trying to hide his grin.

Mom clapped her hands together.

"I've never seen you two actually come to an agreement.

I'm very proud of you John, and

I'm also very proud of you too, Luke."

"Thanks Mom," We said in unison.

We both gave her a big hug.

"I'm going to miss you Mom," said John.

"I'm going to miss you more!" said Mom in reply.
