The reason that people should join the Seagoing cowboy program is it saves animals over in Europe.

They shiped horses, young cows, and mules overseas.

They would take care of the animals as they where being shiped so Luke and Don sighned up.

They got their with 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them all.

They hade a long trip their they got there on August 14 1945.

It was the day the Pacific war had ended.

Luke was 18 before arriving in Greece so he could be drafted for military service.

In the text it states that when the draft borad hade learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to keep doimg that, he made 9 trips.

So it was long but it sounds fun to me and they did good for the world by helping other people.

So if I coud I would. It's also the right thing to do.

After this would you do it?
