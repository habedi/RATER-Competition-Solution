Cars are an everyday thing, you need them to get to work, to school, to pick up your kids, but what happens when the cars drive themselves? People have long dreamed of cars that drive themselvs, but most people dont know that google has had them sence 2009. Those cars arent compleatly independent, they need a persion to control them, or rather "help" them, like on high trafic areas, or around crashes. there are many advantiges and disadvantiges to the automatic car, but should we have them? Well, there are many reasions we should.

Its no surprize that every single car is as save as phisicly posable. At google, there cars have drove half a million miles without a crash. thats because every car is compleatly loaded with sencers to keep that from happening, let alone the persion in control of the car. another amazing feature this car has is that you can not use the automatic drive without both hands on the wheel, so the driver must pay atenton. That also makes it imposable for texting at the wheel.

Its no secret that aoutmatic cars are the future, with its advanced safty features and its convenence. All this car really needs is suport. Tons of people are compleatly against this idea of cars driving themselvs, but they have no reason to. Its safer, and easyer. This car will only get better with time, so hopefully, everyone will come around in time. so know you know what happens when cars can drive themselves, the real question is, will my story drive you?
