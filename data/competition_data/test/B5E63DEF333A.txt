The "Face" on Mars is indeed just a narural landform. It was first recorded in 1976. When this happened everyone went crazy because they thought it was a form of aliens. Yet they were incorect. NASA has now said that it is just a natural landform and has evedince to prove it as well.

In paragraph 3 it talks about how the fce is just a natural landfor. Saying it is just a rock formation. Also it says that the shadows just give it the illoution of being a face. Which means the sun has cast shadows on the rocks and the way the rocks were formed it made the shadows fall in the wholes appering to be a face when it really isn't.

In paragraph 7 it says that there is no alien mounuments. Proving most theroy's wrong. They found this out by taking another photo with a better liense so they can soom in and see what is really there. By doing this they found no alie monuments and that it is just a land formation as NASA origonaly belived.

Also in paragraph 12 it says the face is equivilant to mesa or buttle. Which means that it is compare to mesa and buttle wich are both natural landforms on Earth. Also in this paragraph it was proven that the rocks were created by lava. So now it is considered a lava dome.

So over all scients now belive that it is just a natural landform and that there is no aliens ther and that there never was. Insted they say it is just a rock formation that was made out of lava. So it is now cocidered a lava dome. Also they say it is just like our natural landforms here on Earth.
