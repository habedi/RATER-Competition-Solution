I donÃÂ´t eat lunch at school and I donÃÂ´t pack my lunch. I disagree because we are in school for a long time,spend time with family, and after school responseibility.

First, we are in school for a long. Our schechedule says we get to school 7:00 and we get out of school at 2:30. Students get bored after a while and play games on their computer. Students donÃÂ´t like the schools lunch and some donÃÂ´t pack lunch.

Second, spend time with their family. Your family might have a fishing competion to see who caught the most fish and the biggest one. You might play board games with your family like Uno,Checkers,and Twister. You might play video games with your family like Family Feud,Mario Kart 8,and Rocket League.

Final,after school responseibility. You might help your grandpa work on the car, or help your grandma with cooking. You might have to do chores like washing the dishes, do laudry, and fixing your bed. You might have a dog in a crate, or you might have to feed them and give them water.

In conculison, you might have chores to do, get bored in school,and might not see your mom or dad until saturday and sunday. Do you agree or disagree with my opinion ?
