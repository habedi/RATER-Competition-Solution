I disagree that attend classes from home can benefit student. If the student stays at home there will no social interaction between the students and the teacher. Without face to face interaction, the student will be scared of talking to strangers in the street or even family members. This can damage our socity and a way of living. Future kids not willing to talk to people face to face unless its on the computer. Online or video conferencing and be very unreliable, connection can be a problem what if you disconnet during a leasson and what happens if you cant get back online the whole lesson is over. There are more benefits, going to a class then looking at a computer screen. Talking to other students can help with people who have social problems and learn to communicate with other students. Interacting with the teacher can be good for students, he can ask the teacher questions, help the student with any problems face to face, and getting to know the student having a converstion about sports or the lesson the teacher is teaching. Teaching classes at home can waste lots of time and money for the teacher and the student. One there will be some students who will choose the online class and will either not learn from the online classes or will completely ingnore it entirely. The student will get a assignment to work on and they will copy it online or not do it at all since there on the computer all the time. This is why online classes are just terrible idea to begin with, students will not pay attention and wont do the work.
