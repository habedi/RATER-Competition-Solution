Dear Mr. Senate,

The Electoral college method is not a very good system. The avrage American probably doesnt know that they are voting for slates insted of the president. This is why we should change it to popular votes. Everything would be so much easier and we would have a clear answer on who won and who was our president.

When we The people vote we dont want to vote for slates. We dont wsnt to put our trust into someone who we have never met into voting for the person we want. We want to vote clearly for who we want. Over 60% pf the people would prefer a direct election over the type of election that we have today.

The way we select who is president now is unfair. With the winner take all system the candidates dont spend much time in states they know they wont win in. This is why we need to change the system. I ask you for the people change this unfair system.
