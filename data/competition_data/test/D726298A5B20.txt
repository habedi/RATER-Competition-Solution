" The Challenge of Exploring Venus "

You've heard of astronauts visiting the moon and range rovers roaming Mars, but have you ever heard of people or even range rovers exploring Venus? No living or non-living thing has ever experienced Venus in any type of way due to its harsh conditions! For this reason, the author thinks that we should find a way to go onto Venus, and find out any information about it. Venus may be hiding many amazing things but, we'll never know unless we find a way to get there.

The author believes that although it is difficult to go on Venus, it will be worth it in the end. It is possible that many centuries ago, Venus was very similar to Earth. Scientists believe that long ago, there was even water on Venus. Today, there are many similar features like mountains, valleys, and craters just like Earth.

In conclusion, I agree with the author. I believe that it will be worth it going to Venus. MAybe one day we will be able to find out the amazing things Venus carries.
