Have you thought of the idea that all students must participate in an after school activity would you agree or disagree with this statement?

I agree with the statement that students must participate in an after school activity.

Today we are going to be talking about how you learn more things, get more exercise, and how you can meet new people.

By enrolling in an after school activity you will learn new things.

You may enjoy what you learn.

If you do you may want to continue learning in either a club or by yourself.

You can enhance your studies.

During the activity you can learn about similar material that you learn in a class of your's.

By learning this new topic you may become interested and want to do more with your knowledge.

Doing something more could include having a future career in that certain field.

You may not like the activity, but then again you may use this information in the future.

These are greats reasons which support my thesis.

You could get exercise enrolling in an activity.

At home you may not have the opportunities to get your daily exercise.

Enrolling in this club would mean that you could get your daily exercise which is good for health. You may like a certain sport but don't know how to play it.

Then enrolling in an activity which is for that sport could teach you the basics.

Some people don't have interests in exercise or sports.

In sport activities they could maybe become interested and start playing it.

These are strong reasons supporting my claim.

You can meet new people within your activity.

If you enroll in an activity you most probably were interested.

Other people in the same activity probably did it for the exact same reason, and that could build a base for your friendship.

You can practice with each other.

When you get together to practice you can find out what else they are interested in and talk about that.

Someone may not have the necessary equipment. Someone can provide you with it because they have built trust.

These are great idea's supporting my reasoning.

These are the reasons why I agree with the statement all students must participate in an after school activity.

In the first body paragraph we talked about how activities help us learn new things and how you may enjoy what you learn, it can help enhance your studies, and you may want to do more with your knowledge in the topic.

In the second body paragraph we talked about the exercise involved and how, at home you may not get exercise, you may enjoy the sport but don't know how to play, and you may want to start sports.

In the third body paragraph we talked about how you meet new people and how you have similar interests, you can help each other, and you can help each otherÂ out. I hope now you understand my reasoning to why I agree with after school activities being a must.
