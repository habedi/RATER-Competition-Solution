I think that the use of the new technology to read the emotional expressions of people is not valuable. If people want to tell you how they feel, then they probably will. I do not think you should "invade" their privacy, feelings, and emotions. People have their own feelings and they have them because they are THEIRS. If they wanted to share their feelings then they would. But a lot of people want to keep their feelings to themselves.

Humans every day kind of do the same thing as this new technology does. The article states " In fact, we as humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day." Which is true, because if say we see a friend who is upset about something, and they are not really crying or anything, but you can just tell by their face that they are upset; then that's using a "humanized version" of the new technology. That is almost the same thing as the new technology, except with the new technology it literally SCANS your face and has access to your personal emotions. It invades your private mind.

Another reason that supports my opinion is that the student's peers could find out the results from a person's scan and tell everybody when most people want to keep their feelings/emotions to themselves. This is not a good idea, it is sharing to all kinds of other people how someone feels and that is not okay. You have to let people have their own thoughts. When they did the scan on da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting, that is fine because it's just a painting. The painting is not a living thing with feelings.

I think that if someone wants to use the new technology to scan historic pictures or historic things then that is okay. I think it's important to understand our past. If finding out what someone from the past was feeling helps us understand history then yeah sure! Why not do it. It's not going to hurt anybody or anything like if you were to use the technology on something living.

In conclusion, I believe that we should not use the new technology on anything that is living and has feelings. But I think that it is okay to use it on historic things (like da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting) so we can really truly understand the word's past. It is important for people to have their own feelings, emotions, and thoughts. It is also okay for people to share their feelings. But they should not always have to share them. I feel like in a way, this new technology is "forcing" people to share their emotions, feelings, etc.
