In this story I will be telling you about how the supposed face made by aliens are actually just made by a natual landform that looked like a face.

This is how we know that it was not made by aliens if it was made by a alien then how is it decaying would they of came back to fix it. To have it stay forever or do they just not care about it anymore.

Also wouldn't it of kept it's shape for more than 25 years or do you think that is just a sequence that happens to things over time. You never know if they are more advanced then us and can keep all of their stuff in ship shape and if it was a alien it would of stay and not changed.

"Matian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." "Formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth."
