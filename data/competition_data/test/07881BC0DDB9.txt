In my opinion I think that the teacher should pick the projects they want their students to do. The teacher can design the project in a way that they're able to relate to the information that their students were taught the previous year. By having the teacher design the project it will help the students to be able to remember most of the information they were taught throughout the school year and could help them for the next school year. Most students do tend to forget a good portion of the things they were taught in school over break.

When I'm out of school on summer break, the last thing I'll ever think about is school. Being out of school and having other things on my mind like having a job, I only ever think about the very little stuff that I was taught in school that I might actually need. I mostly watch TV or I'm on social media so of course I'm not going to remember half the stuff taught to me. The only classes that can be useful to me are math and personal finance. The idea of a teacher giving me a summer project would be a better option rather than having to come up with one on my own.

A good reason to having a summer project designed by a teacher would be that when you start the new school year some of that information would still be there. Doing this project could help prepare yourself for the next school year. Having this project can keep you learning while your still on summer break. While doing this project you could possibly learn some new things that could be of good use. This project can make the teachers job a little easier by having this summer project.

Now if it were up to the students to design their own projects they probably wouldn't cover the main topics their teacher wants them to. Some students might only cover the things that they only remember and it could possibly not help them for the new year. Other students might forget about the project or wait till last minute to do the project if it were up to them to design their own project. If these things were to happen it wouldn't be helping the teacher or the student.

In conclusion, I still think it would be best if the teacher were to design the summer projects and not the students. The teacher can get the students to present the information that they will need heading into the new school year. Some teachers are wiling to help keep their students learning over break to make it a little easier when school starts again. If I was offered the opportunity I would take it rather to be struggling in the beginning of the year.

Everything that I stated point towards the reason why I say the teachers should design the summer projects and not the students.
