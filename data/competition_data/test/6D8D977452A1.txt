Dear Principal,

I have an issue that I would like to discuss with you. It involves the schools cell phone policy. I realize that having cell phones at school might be a bit distracting to students and if they have their phones with them all day long at school, they might start to act up in class by getting worse grades than they usually do, but cell phones are also a bit of a necessity. You see, some people might have an emergency going on and they might need to use their cell phones to call their parents or tell them that they are going home with a friend or they volleyball practice was canceled or something in that area. There is always going to be things occurring and cell phones will have to be the last resort. For these reasons, I pick Policy 1.

I chose policy 1 because I feel that is the most rational policy out of the 2 policies given. Policy 1 states: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. While Policy 2 states: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all. I feel that if students aren't allowed to use their cell phones at school, some people might switch schools because it is such a strict and harsh rule. If students are allowed to bring their phones at school, but are only allowed to use them during a reasonable time, I don't see any conflict with that policy.

The students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, just not during class because that will result in students fooling around the whole time and it is just a bad idea. I think that if you give students a rule that is both reasonable and fair, then they will follow it. But if you give them a rule such as no phones at school at all, no matter what, they will continue to break it again and again, because it is a restricted thing.

As you can see, I think the best choice to make is to go with Policy 1. This way your not being to harsh or too uncaring about the situation at hand. I think most students would appreciate if you let them have a little bit of a break at school since they do spend a lot of time there. It is a good way of telling them that you appreciate all their hard work and this is a little reward. Thank you for considering my statement.

Sincerely,
