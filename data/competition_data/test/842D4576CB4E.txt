Most of the people in the world forget the things they learned after a long period of time. In the summer students dont worry about school, classwork, and homework. They are worried about havng fun outside of school. The students go all day and all night for the whole summer forgeting about school. Until teachers started designing summer projects. Teachers should be the ones who design summer projects because it will help students understand the information in the summer time, not forget the information, and be more and be more responsible.

Students should come back to school understanding the information. If the information has to be retaught then thats taking away what new information your learning or how much information you could have learned. If students were to make their own summer projects, they would have made it no challenge. Made it as to where they could be finished in a day. A teacher would put some information they dont know or need to work on so it is a little bit of a challenge. During the summer, if students dont do their projects made but their teacher they will not understand or retain the information.

Summer time is the time to relax and have fun. Just because you are out of school doesnt mean you stop learning new school topics. When your teacher makes a project they are putting in all the information they feel like you need to work more on and all the things you need to keep practicing in order to remember that information. Say for example a student named Generic_Name makes the project prompt for theirselves, then Generic_Name doesnt remember everything that they worked on from the beginning of the year to the end. So she puts in all the information that she knows then next year when she comes back, her new teacher asks her about something that she didnt put on her project and she doesnt know it.

Projects are fun ways to learn new material. Teachers give out projects expecting you to return them done to the best of your ability. A project you made will just make you become lazy and just make you wait until the last minute to do it. Summer projects made by the teacher will show so much responsibility on your behalf because teacher make projects and work to help you gain on your struggles. You taking the time out of your day to sit and do your work without someone telling you, knowing that you dont have to do it shows great reponsibility. From this you will build great habbits and the next year of school you wil be the most responsible person at the school.

In conclution, summer projects should be designed by the teachers to make sure they understand the information, not forget what the information is, and learn how to be more reponsible. If teachers start to design summer projects the schools will grow better than they use to be, the students will do great things with their life, and the world will be a better place.
