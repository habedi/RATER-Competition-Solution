It is crucial that we do not support the principal's decision to have students do at least one after school extracurricular activity. One of the reasons for this is homework assignments. Students get new homework assignments and tests coming up on a daily basis. The amount of homework I get can sometimes be too much for me to be able to go to any after school extracurricular activities. For example: Last week I had to study for two tests that were coming up in two different subjects. One test was for my Social Studies class, also known as Civics, and the other test I had was for my English class. Both have been difficult and time consuming. I had to use the five minutes I had between classes to study for both of the tests.

Another reason is how far you live from school and how long it takes you to get home. If you live far away from school, the time it takes you to get home is increased. After school extracurricular programs only take up time that I might need in order to complete my homework assignments on time, because I have to complete my homework before 6:00 if I want to eat dinner and go to sleep on time. If these extracurricular activities became mandatory, then I would get home at 4:45 and have very little time to do my homework. I go to school tired because I stay up late doing homework that is due the next class. I am not the only one with these problems. Other students can also get a substantial amount of homework to do in only two days.

Another problem is that we have to pay to go to after school extracurricular activities. After school extracurricular activities can also cost money as an admission fee. Some families might not have enough money to be able to pay this. It wouldn't be fair to the students who have to go to the after school extracurricular activities and their parents who have to pay for these activities. In conclusion, I believe that we should not support the principal's decision to have us do at least one after schoolÂ extracurricular activity.
