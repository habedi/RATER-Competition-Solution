Dear TEACHER_NAME

I believe that changing school policy that any student without a grade B average cannot play sports or school activities is a great idea. Grades should always come before any school activities so the students should have to keep their grades up or the cannot participate in any school activities. If the star of the football team was averaging a C average I don't think since he's the star on the team that he should get any chances until he gets his grades up. If the students knew they were averaging a C average and knew they couldn't play in sports or other activities until they got their grades up and you just let them play anyway they would think they could get away with anything. Without a strict way of doing things the students would try to get away with anything making the school look like their running things wrong. That's why I support the school policy change for it would make the school a lot better in so many different ways.
