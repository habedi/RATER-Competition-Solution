Dear Principal,

I highly encourage you to set the policy number 1 where you allow students to bring cell phones to school. I believe cell phones are necessary for young students because its a way to communicate with parents, friends and other people quickly and fairly easily. I believe outlawing cell phones in schools can be a safety issue to students who live fairly far from the school for the simple fact that they won't have any form of communication with their families. Also I believe allowing cell phones can now help a student academically.

With recent advances in technology we are able to do more with a cell phone than just talk and text message. With phones such as the IPhone, Blackberry and the Droid we are able to use phone applications to do everything from web-surfing to education. If cell phones are allowed in schools they can be used productively during class to distribute homework, notes and to do research for projects. Even if the cell phones can only be on during lunch or other free periods it can help students be more focused in school instead of wondering what new texts they got or trying to secretly text their parents during an emergency.

Though allowing cell phones to school can be highly beneficial, i believe the students should be reminded that it is a privilege not a right. I understand the saying "give a man a inch and he'll try to take miles" and I know when some students are given opportunities they try to "push the envelope" and try to over use the opportunity. I believe that if you allow the policy number one but a cell phone is out in class when it is not a true emergency, that the phone should be confiscated and given to the students parents. I also believe that constant offenders of that rule should be excluded from the policy and are forced to not bring their phone to school.

I believe cell phones are extremely important and passing the first policy in opposition to the second will can be beneficial to students, parents and even the school if they decide to take advantage of the opportunities given by this policy. This can make students morally happy and make them work harder opposed to the other policy which can upset students and decrease their production rate. This opportunity is golden and all we need is for you to put it in affect.
