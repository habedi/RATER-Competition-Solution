Dear Principal,

I think all students should be required to perform community service. Many wouldn't agree with me because they want to spend time watching T.V. or playing video games. But I think it's a very generous thing to perform community services. It helps people out, and makes you a better person. I think everybody should spend some of their own time donating their help.

Many people would argue that they wouldn't get to hang out with their friends or have any fun doing community service. I disagree. You could have your friends help you with the service, and you could get more accomplished. It makes you a better person. Helping others makes you feel good.

Kids might also complain that community service would be too boring. But it doesn't have to be boring. You can make it fun. Maybe instead of picking up litter you could help out at an animal shelter and take care of cute, little puppies. You could use one of your interests and find a community service that would have to do with that interest. It doesn't have to be boring, having a bad attitude about it would make it seem that way.

Many people don't realize how good they have it, and that they are lucky to have what they have. That's why some wouldn't want to perform community services. I am all for volunteering and doing community services. It makes you feel like a better person, and you have that nice thought knowing you helped somebody out. This is why I think all students should perform community services. Please consider my opinion. Thank you.

Sincerely,
