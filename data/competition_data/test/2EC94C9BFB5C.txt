Would like to go out into the sea and have alot of fun? I think i would! Here are a couple of reasons why, first off you could visit new places. Also you could see new things. Lastly you could get use to the water.

It was in 1945, World war 2 was over in eroupe and many counttries were left in ruins. So what i mean about visting new places is that, you could pretty much go anywhere, well as long as there was water. What i really meant was you can go to china florida all of those nice water filled places. Lastly they are just very nice and a besautiful place to stay.

Now you could see new things. Maybe things you have seen in pictures, or magazines, or something on your mobile device, that you would like to see in real life, like if you go to the china you could see "The Great Wall of China." Just those kinds of things makes it exciting to go new places and see new things. So i hope your ready for this next paragragh.

You would have to get used to the water! I know, i know it doesnt sound that bad, until one night you eat some bad shrimp and there is a storm a brewing up in the sky, the boat starts to rock in the wind, then you feel it coming, up, up, and out of your throat comes the vomit, over to the side of the boat you run. Hey i told you, you would have to be prepared for this paragraph, now didnt i warn you. Now back to what i was saying. You would have to get used to the water. There is a lot of things that could go wrong. You throwing up, you sliding off the edge. You would just have to get used to thed currency and record when the waves come by so you know when another one is coming. Like if a wave came at 2:00pm, then another one come at 2:30pm you excpect another one to come at 3:00pm.

Those were all of my reasons why i think you should go be a seagoing cowboy.
