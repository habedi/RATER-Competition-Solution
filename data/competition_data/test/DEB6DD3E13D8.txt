Yes I agree with the principal. I agreed because students need to have at least 30 minuets out side. Students should also be a part of an activity in there school because it is very fun. The principal said that you have to at least do one activity. It is good for you if you stay after school to do activities like sports or work on the year book you can also work on your homework if you need help. It is good for you because you get to learn new things about your school and also can represent your school you can also stay in shape.

Most of the students in the school dont do any thing because they are to lazy or they have to take care of there siblings. For example when I was in fifth grade I had two activates that I did an they were basketball and there was a club named on my road and we did our homework and when we were done we go out side and play sports and each day we had a different sport. I had a lot of fun when I was doing actives after school because I got to get away from my sisters and my mom because my mom always cleans and it annoys me because right when I get back from school my mom says go clean your room, clean the living room, go clean the bathroom and when I am done I barely had time to do my homework.

Some activities can help you in the future because you can get to go to college for free if you are good student and have good grades and know how to play a sport. In my opinion it is very fun to do a sport because you get to meet new people and even get better at sports and get to compete against other schools. That is why I think that students should do activities after school.
