Do u want too do "extracurricular activities" ? You too go home and eat and play Fortnite. My names Generic_Name, and I dont agree with this idea. This idea makes us tired and more sore we already have fitness tests plus this. I am a very lazy guy u might think, but Im just looking out for my fellow peers. They might not agree with this idea either. They want too relax and sleep at home and some of them their families, have too work late they may not have all the time in the world and those activities could make them loose time with their loved ones. I think that this rule that the our principle is trying too do is not a good idea. Some people may not be fit too play sports like health issues there bones are weak and asthma. If we are in a game and a kid has a asthma attack and gets hurt that would be bad for the school by forcing this rule. This rule could mess people up like in injuries sprained ankles,broken bones and head trauma. I do not think it is safe for my peers. While doing this people can just not just not want too do it . The principle cant force them and people will protest if this is a issue and no one wants that. Also it will lead too hand to hand contact which can help people get the Corona Virus. I think that this is not a good idea leading with our world problems this may not be the best option. In conclusion making kids do "extracurricular activities" in my opinion and listing why not too I strongly disagree on this future rule.

Some people just want too be lazy because they feel like it or they do not want too do this. People with health issues are in danger too . Please help our fellow peers and not have them do more physical work let them be.
