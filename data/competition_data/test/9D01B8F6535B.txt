Dear Principle,

I support your idea of making us do community service because it will help us do the right thing help us stay on the right track to a successful life and carrier. We must work together to support do community service because if we don't we won't have a great life which we have right now but with out doing community service we will probably do most likely bad and wrong things in life and we will be disappointed. We must try to put community service as one of the things that is required from us in school. If we do community service it will help us in future life. The way it will help is it will give us a way to do something instead of wasting time and it will help us stay on the right track of success.

First, instead of wasting time doing something bad we could do community service. The reason why it will help us stay on a good life track that will lead to success. By doing so you sir, the principle, will help us on life for the future by working hard and doing the right thing on life's success. If you don't put community service as one thing we must perform, we might lead to a life we hate because we did bad things we are not suppose to do and hate our self because the way we turn out. So you, the principle
