RELATIVE_NAME solemnly looked out the window.

His dreams were crushed, shattered, by the new limit on GPA for sports.

He was a good student too.

On his report card, he was awarded with the best behavior in the class.

But no matter how hard he tried, the only thing he could truly shine in... was baseball.

He had 4 b' s and 2 c' s, just barely below the limit.

His high school baseball dream had vanished just as the stamp hit the paper and left the word "passed" in plane black ink.

By making a rule requiring a B average to go out for sports, we would be effectively vaporizing our current athletic dominance in the world.

We would be stopping many possible pro athletes before they even could get the chance to realize their potential.

We would be hurting our economy.

And, we would be denying the average American student the right to try out for sports.

This rule would be cruelly unfair to all young, aspiring athletes.

Many professionals currently in the NBA and the NFL had a GPA of less than a 3.00 in their middle school and high school years.

If they had been denied the right try out for sports due to their academic shortcomings, they likely would not be a professional athlete at all.

This would drastically lower the average skill level in professional sports and in the Olympics, where our country is represented by our athletes.

This would be a preposterous way to attempt academic improvement.

Passing this rule would dramatic hurt our sports economy.

The U.S. has billions of dollars in the sports industry, whether it be making football gear, tennis racquets, running shoes, or stadiums.

This rule would deal a major blow to the economy.

The average American child has a C average.

That said, raising the cap would only allow the top 65 percent to try out for sports.

This not only is unfair, but it is unconstitutional.

Denying the average student the right to try out for sports directly contradicts the rights that are endowed to us in the U.S. constitution, and therefore should not be allowed.

If passed, this rule will be sent to congress and very likely be repealed.

All in all, this rule should not be passed.

By cutting off many possible pro athletes, denying the average kid to try out for sports in school, and hurting the economy, this rule will do more damage than good to the nation.

Therefore, it is in our best interest that this rule not be passed.
