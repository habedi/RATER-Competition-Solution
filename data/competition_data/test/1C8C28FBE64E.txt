Have you ever met someone or know someone that does classes for school at home? Well, this is called home school or online classes. Many schools offer these program for children and teens. Some may say that online classes are not beneficial at all but I say it is. Online classes are beneficial because many children have health issues, they move to different places, and some children learn at different paces. Home school or online classes are beneficial to many children.

Firstly, many children have health issues that require them to stay at home. For example, a child can be connected to a medical machine that is require to stay in one spot or can be hard to move around. Therefore, the child must stay at home or at a hospital. The child somehow has to get an education, therefore, his or her parent can enroll the child to do online classes. Eventhough, the child is not in a classroom environment, the child can still learn by doing his or her courses online. Online classes are beneficial when a child can not access a classroom due to health issues.

Secondly, many children move to different places due to parent's job. For example, a child has parents that are in they army. His or her parents have to move to a different location that their commander has order them to move. The child will have to move to a whole new different school in order to keep getting a education, they will have to adapt to that new school environment, and be prepare to move again. With online classes the child will not be enrolled in any other school and go through paper work every single time they move. Having parents that move for jobs can be real difficult, especially for the child. With online classes they can move and still learn without the hassle of filling out paper work and adpating to a new school.

Thirdly, children learn at different paces. Many children need more time to learn specific subjects then others. For example, a child in a classroom can be behind than the other children in the classroom. That child is having a hard time keeping up and is struggling a lot. Well, with online classes the child can work at his or her pace and can get a better understanding of the subjects they struggle in. Also, the child can have contact with a teacher that can help him or her answer a question they do not understand. Online classes are very useful to help a child learn and not be rush to learn the material they need to learn.

Many have said that online classes are not beneficial at all. They say it's a lot to pay for materials the children need, the children don't do the work, and that children can stay with relatives while the parent moves. Well, I believe that online school are very beneficial to children because it helps children a lot when it comes down to education. All children are not the same and have different situations that requires them to do online classes.

In conclusion, online classes are beneficial to children because of health issues, moving, and learning at different paces. Not every child is going to have the opportunity to wake up in the morning and go to school, but with online classes every child is going to have the opportunity to have an education. So, when you think about why online classes are so important, think about how every child is not the same and some need more time to learn then others.
