Dear Principal,

In my opinion you should use cell phone policy two. If you use policy one, children might be tempted to use their phones in class even though it says that they need to be turned off. Children today know how to find ways on how to use their phone in class. Teachers will probably not notice children using their phone in class because their back is usually turned to the class in order to write on the chalkboard/white board. For example, some children will try to look as if they were looking for something in their backpack when really they are texting. With policy two children wouldn't even have their phones in class which would take the temptations of using their phone in class away. To help enforce policy two you should get the parents involved. You should have all parents check their child for their phones, because knowing most children the WILL try to sneak their phone to school. Another option would be to turn in their phones in the morning and then picking them up right as school ends before they leave. Also, without their phones, children will pay more attention in class instead of trying to text and they will get better grades. All in all I think that Policy two would be the better choice. I hope that this letter will aid you in deciding in a cell phone policy.

Sincerely,

Parent
