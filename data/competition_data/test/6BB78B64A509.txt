Dear principal,

I think you really should reconsider on the cell phone policy in school. The reasons why you should reconsider on the policy is so they could use it during lunch time and free time and as long as their phone are turned off during class. In this letter i will give you a little bit more detail on why you should focus on reconsidering the cell phone policy in school.

my first for why you should reconsider the policy is because students tend on leaving some stuff at home by accident. They sometimes want to call their mom and ask them to bring it to school for them. they cant do that if you wont allow them to use their cell phones.

allowing them to use their phones during lunch and free time will give them an opportunity to call their mom or also they need to change clothes because some thing spilled on them. statistics show that 75% percent of kids in America are not up to grade because they are not allowed to use their phone in school so they just use it in class. So if you reconsidered the policy kids would actually be more successful if they get to use their phone without getting in trouble for it.

Another reason why you should reconsider the policy and let kids use their phone during lunch time and free time is because. The students will always have some kind of time for them self and it will keep students more organized so for example if a student has a project due that day but they forgot to write on paragraph and that students partner is not there. if you allowed a students to use their phone they could text them or call them and say " what should i write for the paragraph". easily one of the students could be either writing it or typing it while he or she is communicating with the partner on their cell phones.

My last reason why you focus on reconsidering the cell phone policy is because the students wont have to sneak around during class anymore to use them so that prevents kids from getting in trouble and kids will learn more and become more successful. To make sure the student phone is off you could easily take the students phone as they walk in and check. You see allowing students to use their phone during lunch and free time is preventing distraction in class from kids not focusing. allowing students not to use their phone is causing the distraction in class.

i really hope you really focus on reconsidering on letting students use their phone in school it would be a great help to a child success in school and wont prevent any distractions. One last time i think why you should reconsider the cell phone policy is because it allows students to ask their parents to bring them something from home or clothes. it could hep children succeed if they forget stuff on projects and prevents distractions in class. thank you for your time i hope i convinced you to reconsider the cell phone policy.

sincerely,
