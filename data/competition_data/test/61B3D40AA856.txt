Every student gets really impatient towards the end of the school year because summer vacation is just around the corner. Having to not do any school work for three months is a major blessing for students who are constantly surrounded by work. However, some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning over their break.

Being assigned a project over your well-deserved vacation isn't the best thing to come across, but it'd be way better if you were in control of it. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would be based off of their interest, they'll know how to set it time for it, and they'll be more creative.

Doing a school related project based off of your interest can come with so many advantages that leads it to be successful. For example, if you play football and your project requires you to make a time line about one of your hobbies to see if you improved, you would most likely make your project about football. Your interest can make things way easier for you because you'll know what to accomplish. Also, if you're doing something that you like it won't necessarily be boring. For instance, when I was in tenth grade we were required to do a personal project about something we would want to show improvement in, since I knew that I haven't drawn in a while I decided that I wanted to improve in it. It makes your project easier and helps you to not over think about it.

Stressing out over summer vacation should never come upon anyone. Being a student with a summer project that they can design can help them manage their time. We all know that time management is important, especially when you have plenty of other things to do. It becomes a hassle when you have certain deadlines to reach when you're supposed to be on relaxing vacation. According to my friend, when she was in the CISL program at her school, she was required to do a project over summer that had deadlines for every target in her project. She was stressing so much that she wasn't able to meet most of those deadlines. That shows how much of a teacher designed project can make you not be successful and stressed out. However, if she were to do a student-designed project, there would be no hassle. Also, when students have plans for summer they'll be able to make time for their project because they know what to do and what not to do since they are in control of it.

Lastly, creativity is the most important factor of making a project. It shows the amount of effort put in to the project and since it is a student designed project, it would be more fun and interesting. For example, I did a project based off of my interest and since I was so focused in my project I made it look nice as possible. I cared about what my project was going to look like and how it was going to be presented because since I designed it every part of it would represent me and how much effort I put into my work. For example, if you are participating in a science fair, you would want your project or experiment to look presentable. That is why creativity will show throughout a project that the student designs.

Overall, having to do work over your summer vacation doesn't sound good, but if we were required to do a summer project, it'll be more beneficial to do a student-designed one rather than a teacher-designed project. Even though teachers have you meet certain requirements, students will be interested if they choose what they are doing. Also, it'll give less stress and more focus which is needed in order to make their project successful. It is better to be having fun on break rather than worrying if you met the teacher guidelines.
