To Principal:

I wouldn't think that changing the school policy for grade average. If you change this there will have no students eligible for any school activities. Many students are at a C average. It would be impossible for most of the student body to move up a letter grade average before the sport opportunities are available for the season.

I think the grade average should stay at a B average. So, that more kids can do activities. This new policy would start making the students give up on wanting to do work. The C average is at a good range for students to be passing and be attending other fun activities.

Most students are at a C average. That's most of student body. If we had to be at a C average then there would be no sport teams for our school. Sense not all our school is at that level and some other students don't like sports. There will end up not having anyone sign up for sports. Our school will end up being the boring not fun school in our community.

Sincerely,

The Student Body
