The use of this techonolgy so called Facial Action Coding,is not valuable at all. As technology may be advancing that doesn't mean it can't fail us. Reading a persons facial expression will not determine their mood. Like the author said, " The facial expressions for each emoton are unversial." It could also have to do with their body language. Weither the person is slouching or always hiding their hands, also how their voice level is. Sure it could be easier by going at a painting, but in your point of view it's a whole different story.

Body language can determine many different things in someone. It could be weither you have a back problem, trying to grab your back because of the pain. Slouching could be not because you are tired, but maybe a syptom of depression. Since the computer is only recognizing your emotion(s). I personally do not think a computer could read or tell you that.

Voice level could be one of many signs of emotion. If one is scared or frightend, your voice can let out a shriek. One can be happy and still have either that low or a more louder voice. Computers can't figure this out and we are trying to depend on some code that was invented. In the text it says, "muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes." How can a muscle determine your emotion. One could be confuesd or trying to see more clearly because of the vision.

Your point of view is better than a computers understanding. Seeing a person face to face can maybe change something. They could be happy and here you come with that sad face. Then the seeing the persons emotion makes you suddenly feel better. A computer can't see what just happend between you and the person.

Computers are smart but not that smart.
