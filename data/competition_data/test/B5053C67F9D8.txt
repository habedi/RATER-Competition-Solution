Have you ever thought about joining the Seagoing Cowboys? If you haven't you definetly should. Just go ask Luke Bomberger. I am going to to be talking about his story and his reasons and stating some of my own. This job will actually make you want to get up in the morning to go to work, it's so awesome. Keep reading to find out my reasons you should definetly join this program.

My first reason is being able to travel to all these different countries and knowing your helping someone in need. This program is to bring animals to countries that need these anamils to survive. We are needing extra help to save all these children and family's in need.

Have you ever thought of wakeing up to see the beautiful bright blue ocean with the the juicy red morning sky right outside on the deck, well you can do this everyday on these long trips. Any shift you are working you get nice things like if you work morning shift you get the beautiful sunrise. While you are working you get all these extra nice things, I'm sure you'll love it.

My third and final reason is, YOU AREN'T EVEN WORKING HALF THE TIME. On the way back ,witch is half the trip, you have no animals to deal with so no work. In the article the author stated, " Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed." There so many games you can play even while your on the boat, its a win win for you.

Let's do a recap on why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, my first reason was that you are helping the ones in need. Next I talked about the view you have always wanted when you wake up,it's great. Finally I talked about that half the time you aren't even working. Thankyou for reading my this passage and I hope you think about becomeing a Seagoing Cowboy.
