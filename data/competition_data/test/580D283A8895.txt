Mrs. Principal,

In my opinion, you should allow students to have their phones in school and let them use these devices during free time.

From experience, I don't like having my phone with me during class.

If your mind is thinking about someone texting you back, it interferes with what the teacher is saying.

And if you constantly wonder if you left it on high or vibrate, your mind is wandering, and you can't utilize your resources to their full potential (by resources I mean teachers and other students.)

But also, I believe that students should be able to have their phones available whenever they feel they need them.

For example, let's say I have basketball after school, and my mom thinks that I don't.

I should have a way to communicate to her that I need her to pick me up at 5:30, not 3:20.

Besides, this method is more efficient than calling in the middle of class, on the school's phone, wasting your class's time and your time.

Texting someone while doing your locker combination is easier than taking the time out of the already short 90 minutes designated for class.

Thank you for considering this.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
