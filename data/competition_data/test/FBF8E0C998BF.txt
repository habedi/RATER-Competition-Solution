Every student's dream is to be successful, happy, and healthy in life. One thing that can help people achieve this goal is by taking a part in an extracurricular activity. Whether it be sports, debating, getting work done, or just hanging out, students can gain experiences that can guide them in the path of life. Just by partaking in one after school session, new life lessons can be learned, and things like social skills, core virtues, and new work ethics can be absorbed and applied to daily lives. With that being said, extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students in many ways, including introducing new hobbies, helping to build friendships, and pushing students out of their comfort zones.

Hobbies start out as small things that people do for fun. As time passes, that hobby can become a part of people's daily lives. They constantly use what is learned from those experiences and apply it to other things. It is very useful in so many ways, but some people either choose not to show their talents, or don't know where to start. By committing to an extracurricular activity, people can explore many different genres of platforms that they can express their skills on. By being able to express their talents, their stress levels can make a steady decrease, and they can focus on the things that make them happy.

Some people can make new friends very easily, but unfortunately, some people are not blessed with that talent. Through extracurricular activities, anyone can find people who have similar interests as they do, where as that can be hard to find in a big places, like new schools or churches. By joining clubs and other programs, people can have fun with other people that they normally would not think to be friends with. For example, a couple of kids that enjoy playing soccer in their free time want to join a soccer club. They attend an interest meeting after school and meet lots of other boys that share the same interest in soccer as they do. When they go to the first practice session, they see all their new friends and have lots of fun with them. In addition to making new friends and hanging out with them during the after school session, the new friends can greet each other in the hall and introduce them to friends that don't go to the soccer club. There are many other instances where something like this could happen, so joining an extracurricular program is very much recommended.

Although it may seem scary, pushing students out of their comfort zones is a very effective work ethic used by parents and teachers that want their children to succeed. By doing this, teens are more likely to acquire good results, no matter what it is that they are trying to succeed in. If a child is pushed to commit to an extracurricular activity, they will not only see how fun it can be, but they can also see how it can help them get further in life. Extracurricular activities are designed to not only help students find what they are interested in, but they help students that are having a hard time. They are suited for people that aren't able to go to other places to join clubs and people that have schedules that are not suited for other places. Extracurricular activities can ensure a safe, fun place that provides a place for students to express their creativity.

In some ways, extracurricular activities can be intimidating to people that are scared to go out and meet new people. Nevertheless, extracurricular activities can help people explore new passions, make new friends, and be pushed to always try their best whenever and wherever. If people have a hard time finding out what after school activities they should participate in, they should always go to their counselor for help or talk to another trusted adult. At the end of the day, extracurricular activities are a fun alternative to going other places that will always there to benefit you and guide you to a sure success.
