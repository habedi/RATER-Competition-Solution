Driving in and of it self has always had a bad side to it. Although, lately the effects have just now begun to show. The city of Paris is just one example of a city suffering from the harmful effects of driving-smog. Air pollution has always been a big contributor to harming cities and its inhabitants. Limiting car usage could greatly decrease the amount of air pollution produced. Bogota,Colombia (Source 3) has already begun to take part in limiting it's car usuage as have many other places in the world.

As individuals have stated: 'America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling' as seen in Source 4, the damage to the environment has already been done. Air pollution clouds many cities of the world as seen in Paris (Source 2). The city is clouded with air pollution that is harming its inhabitants and many other places of the world are suffering as well.

German has always played a role in car roduction but even they are giving up their cars. Source 1 explains how a large percentage (up to 70 percent) of city inhabitants have given up their cars.

Limiting car use not only helps the environment, but also the citizens of the surrounding cities. Citizens although they may be cautious of the pollution are not cautious of the toll it takes on their health. Limitng the car usage also means 'beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment' (Source 4). Even though America as awhole and also the entire world has long contributed to car usage, the effects can not be unwound but hopefully bettered. Air pollution has made it mark on the world and we as its inhabitants must now do our part and minimize our carbon footprint. By reducing this, you are saving the enviornment for a little longer and if everyone contributes thats alot of saving. The environmment and the world need everyone to limit their car usuage because if we do not continue to reduce it, the cities we love so dearly will not be so beautiful for much longer. Air pollution is a major strain to the environment and must be stopped.

In conclusion, limiting car usuage is very beneficial because; it reduces air pollution, and beneficial carbon emission. Alone this cause can not be fought against, but if continued efforts such as giving up a car for a day continue then the world can benefit majorly.
