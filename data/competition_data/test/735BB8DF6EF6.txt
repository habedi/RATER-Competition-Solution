Dear principal,

I think that you should not allow students to have there phones in school because you could get fired from your job. Some kids want to have there phones out but they really don't need it. If i was the principal convincing kids not to have phones at school because some students just want to text other kids in the school.

It does not mean that other kids have a rule that they can have there phone out could the kid that they are texting in trouble. So no i don't think that we should have our phones out just so nobody gets in trouble.

Maybe we can have them out at seminar instead of lunch or the hallway, how about if we take a vote to see if they want it in seminar or lunch and hallway. Please let us in seminar instead of lunch. We could ask them about if there students get to have there phone out during lunch and in the hallway. i think no but that is me if i was a principal.

Follow students do you prefer having your phone out when you are in seminar or during lunch and in the hallway. Well that is all I had to ask you thank you for every thing that you do. And don't let your students have there phone out in the hallway and at school. And thanks again!

Sincerely, Student
