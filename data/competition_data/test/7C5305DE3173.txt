The revolutionary end to car culture could be creeping upon us more rapidly than we imagine. In the passage, "Car-Free Cities", authored by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky, they've elaborated a bit more on how cities all around the world are deciding it is time to decrease the use of automobiles, with the exception of hybrid cars and public transportation. The inhabitants of specific cities across the world have taken it into their own hands to reduce the usage of private automobiles in order to slow down pollution. In other places the government are pressing fines or taxes on those who drive their smog-emitting vehicles depending on the day or city. Some people are also commenting that the reduction of car usage has even brought about less stress in their daily lives.

In certain cities across the world, the people are open-mindedly accepting life without personal vehicles. In the first section of the passage, "In German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars", Elisabeth Rosenthal shines light on a city in Germany by writing, "Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called "smart planning."" This allows for homes to be built without driveways and garages, thus reducing the size of the home, allowing more homes to be built in a suburb. Such houses allow for more people to become a part of a fast growing community with a dream to end pollution from personal car usage.

The governments of select cities are declaring specific days for there to be either a reduced number of vehicles on the roads or no vehicles at all, with the exception of public transportation. In section two of the passage, "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, it is acknowledged that, "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day." By Paris enforcing these taxes they are acknowledging that someone has to at leats make an effort to reduce the levels of existing pollution.

By doing this people are able to live more stress-free lives.
