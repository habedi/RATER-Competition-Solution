Do you believe that NASA is with holding information about an alien species? Many people in fact do. However, their arguments are severely flawed. There are thousands and thousands of naturally made landforms on planet Earth, and we can only logically assume there are even more naturally made landforms in space. The landform that is debatebly the most 'likely to be made by aliens' is the Face from Mars. Contrary to what the alien theorists may say, the Face is only another naturally made landform since in high quality pictures it appears quite normal, there are no strange markings or anything around it, and its appearance is only an illusion.

NASA and its team has tried many and many times to get clear pictures of the Face. Nowadays, its getting some of the best pictures that's ever been taken. Jim Garven quotes, We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. "..on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos," furthermore says the article. The pictures showcase the Face as normal and just like any other naturally made landform.

Another thing about the Face that will throw off any conspiracy theorist's opinions is that there are no 'alien monuments' or 'carvings' or 'writings' or anything else around the landform. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all," quotes the article. That wouldn't satisfy the theorists so they thought of something else. Which is, "Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze." Try as NASA might, they didn't find anything that could possibly be apart of anything alien. They took more pictures of the Face, especially on days where it would be clear, yet they found nothing of the sort.

Now, one of the biggest things about the Face is that its own 'face' is an illusion constructed by shadows. NASA even described it as so. When they released one of their first pictures of the landform, "The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'" Illusions are everywhere, and this particular illusion of a face happens to be quite popular. Their picture of the Face attracted much attention from the public because of the allure of a face on Mars. As their pictures became more high quality, it became clear how the formation looked and how those shadows made it look the way it did.

Others may still say now, that the pictures that NASA takes might very well be positioned badly or incorrectly in a way that does not reveal anything crucial to alien life. NASA listened to them though, "few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact." Mission controllers made their way to look at the landform once again. A direct quote from Garvin about the situation is, "Its not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it's hard work." He and everyone else went out of their way to take the perfect picture on a "cloudless summer day". We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution," says Garvin once again. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! NASA did their best and better at looking at and around the Face in order to see if they missed anything as important as signs of alien life. They returned with no proof of anything at all as the theorist's would've liked.

To summarize, the Face is a naturally made landform ontop of planet Mars. First of all, in high definition and quality photographs the landform looks normal and not that strange. Secondly, contrary to what alien believers and theorists may have liked to believe there are no 'markings' or etc. around it whatsoever. Lastly, the eyes and nose and mouth that happen to 'appear' on the landform are only an illusion made by shadows, as stated by NASA itself. Earth has just as many natural landforms and even more possibly than Mars. With a trick of the light or seeing it as a particular angle, we could even interpret our own landforms as something that was made by our own hands even if it clearly wasn't. The Face is a clear example of overthinking and reaching for an answer that was already there, it is a naturally made landform.
