The Author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well in this writting. Teh author is good at showing the two diffrernent sides to the agument but makes you agree with his stance. He used many diffrent examples and also gae a lot of detail in his writting.

To start off his essay with some facts and expalined what he was going to be talking about and some things about planets. One fact he used to start his essay off was " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." ( paragraph 3) This was a great way to start off the writting because he informed his readers about venus before he started to persaude them on a topic.

The author also displaces the oposing information which is always a good thing to do in a pusasive writting. An example of this is " Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for human." ( Paragraph 5) This is higlighing that yes Venus has some dangerous things but is still worthy. So by doing this he is showing the dangers but then can back them up and say some good things about them.

Following this, The author was really good at making the dangerous stuff sound not as bad, one example of this is "Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely for above teh planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrated the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective." (paragraph 6) This supports that he is a good authour and deplaning his stance on the agurmeny becasue he can make the other side information help his stance in an way.

In conclusion, the author did a great job at suporting his idea. The diffrent ways of supporting it made it seem more persasive and he got across alot of ideas and information.
