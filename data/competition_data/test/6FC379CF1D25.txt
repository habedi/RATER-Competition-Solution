Texting and Driving

Today, there are many strict rules about using your device for whatever reason and driving at the same time. I believe that you should not be able to use your phone while you are driving. When you are driving your full attention should be on the road, or things can go bad very fast. It only takes a split second of not paying attention to crash and get into a critical car crash. The laws of texting and driving are firm where they are.

People who text and drive are usually the ones who get into fatal car crashes. If your full attention is on the road and your surroundings, there should not be a problem on the road regardless of any distractions. When you text and drive you are usually texting very quickly and lose track of the road and can end up on another lane or the opposite lane. When you drive you should put your phone down so you can focus on the road and your surroundings. If the message is important, you can call the person and still focus on the road so your eyes won't go from the road to you screen every second.

When teen's usually turn 17 they start to drive, and usually teens are driving fast. If you are already driving fast, you most certainly cannot drive fast, and use your phone. You will not be able to concentrate on the road as well as using your phone to text and drive. Also, if adults are using their phone and driving, that sets an example to the younger generation and they might do it as well if they see their parents do it. New drivers will have a very hard time staying in their lane and having full control on the wheel if they constantly use their cellular device and keep on looking back and forth from their screen to the road. This can obviously lead to a fatal car accident, and is life threatening
