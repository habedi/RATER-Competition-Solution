Dear Principal,

I understand that you are debating two different possible cell phone policies for the school, I believe that you should chose the first of the two policies. For me being a student of the school it is quite obvious that kids need their cell phones for contacting parents, being able to use their own property, and contacting people at different events after school. Kids and teens need their cell phones for thing after school, like going to friends houses and school basketball games, if you used policy two instead of one the kids couldn't contact their parents and ask to stay after school or go to that friends house and that would cause havoc with dismissal.

A second reason for cell phones not to be banned is because the phones are kids property, if you take that way from them they will feel they have no rights as students and will tend not to like you and respect your other rules. Also if you say kids cant have their phones in a middle school or high school, chances are that more kids will use cell phones at school because kids at this age like to rebel.

I also think that if a parent buys a student a cell phone and pays a monthly fee for it, that student should be allowed to use it when he or she needs to use it weather it is at a friends house, on the bus, or in the cafeteria. If a kid needs to find a friend at a after school basketball game or football game, if they are not allowed to have a phone finding that friend will be very difficult. Also think about this, a kid is going to a science team meeting after school, the previous day the teacher said to bring a certain item to the meeting. The child going doesn't remember what that item is so he or she pulls out their cell phone and texts a person who is also on the team and they come to the meet prepared, if policy two was in affect the child would have to go to the meet unprepared and make his or her team suffer at the meet. Policy one could also improve the academics in you school, because kids would be happier so they would do better and kids could text each other to find out the homework and then they would get better grades and you would look like a better principal to the students and other officials because your school would be getting higher grades then before. I really hope you take my concerns and ideas into consideration.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
