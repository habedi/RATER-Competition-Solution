Dear principal,

I disagree with you, that students should need to have a B average to play sports.

The reasons I disagree with you are because a B is above average and students should only have to maintain a average grade to play sports.( C )

By increasing the grade average you have to get to participate in sports you might not have realized that some of your best players might have a C average so with poor sports teams it will decrease kids motivation to play.

You might also not have realized that this will make the students in the school less excited to come knowing that they are not going to be able to play sports because they don't have the capability to maintain a B average.

If the students come to the realization that they can not get a B average they are probably more likely to engage in juvenal activity, such as vandalism and drugs.

If you decide to change the mandatory grade average to play sports then you will be cutting off the people who cant get those grades to their friends which could possibly result in depression, that in the long term could result in suicide.

If you feel as strongly about children's safety and life as a teenager as I do you would not make this grade average change.

I hope you take into consideration all of the points I've listed and come to the realization that this is not a good idea to change the grade average to play sports.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
