Technology has advance so much within the last couple of years. It is crazy how people have easy access to it and are eligible to communicate with each other very quickly. Cell phones are the main source of communication and to this day everyone can not seem to get their eyes off their phone. In many aspects it is good that everyone has a form of device to get around because they do come in handy. Although technology is highly beneficial and has changed the way certain things are being done, it is important that people use it when it is the correct time. A cell phone itself consist of many helpful applications but there are some moments where cell phones should not be in one's hand and that is when they are driving.

Texting while driving is very distracting because the driver does not have full focus on the road. Within this situation, the driver has a very high chance in getting themselves in a car accident. The amount of car accidents that are caused by texting and driving are enormous according to article, "Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving" (texting and driving statistics). It is better to see a problem and avoid it then to just continue to follow through. When people are texting and driving, they are clearly putting their own life at risk which is awful. When the driver takes their eyes off the road, they are most likely asking for something bad. Even then it is proven that texting and driving is worse than an intoxicated person driving, as proclaimed, "One study by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) concluded that texting while driving is six times more dangerous than driving while intoxicated" (Steward law offices). People whom have a very easy temptation to touch their phone should not be driving just as those whom intoxicate themselves and then chose to drive. Ones life is at high risk and since this is a problem that is preventable, everyone should follow through because it endangers someone else's life.

When texting and driving not only is the life of the driver at risk, but also somebody else's. Imagine losing someone or being injured just because one could not put their phone down. It is important to at least be considerate because the numbers of texting and driving have just been going up, as enhance, "The United States Department of Transportation reported the cell phones are involved in a whopping 1.6 million auto crashes each year" (Teen Safe).

Enable for these numbers to go down, everyone needs to take put their phone down. As evidence shows, it is dangerous to be on your phone rather to be intoxicated which means being on your cell phone and driving should be banned all over the world. One may assume because drinking and driving is a crime so would be texting and driving, but in worst matters it is not. In the U.S there are some states that have acted, "Currently, a patchwork of laws governs cell-phone usage by drivers. Some 35 states ban text messaging while driving, 30 states ban cell-phone use by novice drivers, and 10 bans all use of hand-held cell phones, according to the NTSB" (CNN). Although not all states have contributed to this law enforcement yet, some people should at least take this as advice. There could be countries that my not take this into consideration, but it is important that everyone does what is right so not everyone's life is at risk. When driving the driver should withhold full focus on the road and not on their cellphone.

Cell phone use while driving sets a distraction for the driver. It enhances them to multitasks which is nearly impossible to keep full attention on both the road and cellphone. It is better to drive safe then to live a miserable life just because one decided to be on their cell phone. As human beings everyone has important things on their cell phone like maybe an important call or even then an emergency, but nobody's life should be put in danger for something they did not do wrong. A lot of innocent people have had to be the victim in this situation. Before anyone even bothers to even start their car, it is important for them to take care of all their cell phone duty within that time period. If there is ever a moment that one may really need to use their cell phone it is better for them to pull themselves off to the side and take care of their problem because there is no need for this to become an innocent's person problem. Although this may sound like a broken record this is an ongoing problem that can easily be avoided.
