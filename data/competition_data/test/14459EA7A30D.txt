Some people believe that the figure on mars is an alien face. Others believe it is just a huge rock formation which resembles a human head. The eyes, nose, and mouth are formed from shadows which resemble this illusion.

I believe that this so called "alien monument" is just a landform created by debris and rocks. The eyes, mouth, and nose are shadows of the rocks. It's completely obvious. Sure there might be other living organisms out in the universe and different species but there is also severe sand storms on mars. Which can throw rocks, make formations on the ground, and bury certain things. These reasons support my claim. The storms would throw random rocks into random places creating what at first may look like a face but once you get closer you see that it is, in fact, rocks. When rocks are placed together for a long period of time, especially in mars, they start binding together.

I see no other explanation of how this figure was created and I am very confident in my claim.
