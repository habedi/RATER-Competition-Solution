Do you agree that all students should participate in extracurricular activities why or why not? In my opinion think that students should have to participate in extracurricular activities just because a teacher.

I think that kids should be able to choose whether they want to stay after or not to do an extracurricular activities because, for one they may push themselves to work really hard and then the next day they may not feel so well. Secondly they may have personal problems at one that they need to deal with. And lastly they may feel like they are being forced to do some they dont want to do.

My first reason on why this may be a bad idea kids may get wore out. They might push themselves to the point where they cant do well in school cause they need to catch up on sleep. Then they will have to do it all over again after school and it might mess with their health a little bit.

My next reason on why this may not be a good idea is because some kids might have personal problems at home whether that may be a family member passing a way finance problems or they just might be going through harsh times doing theses activities or being forced to stay is not going to help. This could stress them out even more and it could make them feel insecure.

Lastly it could make them feel like they have to play a sport or stay after and they might just do the extracurricular activities because thats what others want.

In other kids should not be forced to do extracurricular no matter if the principal tells them whether the teachers tell them I think its up to them to choose.
