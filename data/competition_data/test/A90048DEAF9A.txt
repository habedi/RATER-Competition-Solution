Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students now in 2011 haven't been helping out the community as much as they really should. If you make it a requirement to have students perform community service i think that it won't only help out our society but also change the minds of kids who think this is a punishment and instead think of it as a great way to help. Kids would gain more exercise by picking up trash on the grounds. They will be a help to many children younger than them if they tutor elementary kids. And they will help out our society way more if you require all students to perform a certain amount of community service a week or month.

I think that students being required to perform community service for a certain amount of hours is a good idea. By having students go outside and pick up all the trash outside of their school, near by a grocery store, or even park would help out not only our society but the students themselves. Students can gain a lot of exercise just by going outside for a walk. It doesn't matter whether they're just walking or doing a great thing for our world by picking up trash on the ground. Either way students are still getting energy and exercise out of this requirement.

Lately in Connecticut, our education scores have been dropping, more and more students are doing bad in certain subjects. If students with knowledge in a certain subject could tutor a younger student who is in need of help that would help us tremendously.

One student can make a difference in a school just by tutoring other students. This could help Connecticut scores move up from around the top 20 smartest states in the world to one of the top 5. Just like it was years ago.

Society today is not doing that well. More and more electronics are coming out so less and less people want to go outside get fresh air and help the community. If Principals start to require students to perform community service for a certain amount of hours than our society will look and feel 100 times better than before. Kids can start picking up trash helping people shovel in the winter to help others from causing crashes, and just helping whenever needed. This would definitely help out our society and the United States.

In conclusion I ,a former student at SCHOOL_NAME, think that it is a good idea if our principal starts requiring students to perform community service. If this happens children of all ages will help make earth better by going outside to pick trash up but also by getting exercise by being outside walking/looking for trash. They could tutor other children to make Connecticut one of the smartest states like it use to be. Also it'll help our society look and feel better than it ever has.

Sincerely,
