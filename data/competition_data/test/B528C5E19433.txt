To Whom it May Concern:

I was just notified that our school principal is reconsidering the cell phone policy.

Policy one is that students can use their cell phones during lunch period and during free times, policy 2 is no cell phones at all. She needs to know which policy is going to be within her best interest.

I personally think that we should go with policy 1. I think that policy one is a better choice because a lot of students like to text during class, and they like to text or use their cell phones on a regular basis. On their regular basis they basically text whenever they hear or feel their phones vibrate or ring. So while the teacher turns their back the students might be texting. I also know that if the principal chose the policy one then the students would do their work and pay attention so they can have free time and text their friends. But also if the principal just does policy 1, then the students wont have to talk or text on their phone when the teacher turns their back and they can get a lot of their work done.

I remember when i was in seventh grade, which was last year i had a teacher named TEACHER_NAME. TEACHER_NAME

didn't care what you did whether it was texting or doing homework. She didn't have any structure to where you would know that you had to get all of your work done before you could text. So that is why so many kids passed her class even though they didn't do the work because she would let you sit there and accomplish nothing. She couldn't fail you if she barely ever gave you work. So then when she actually decided to put her foot down nobody listened at first. But then she made up the rule that if you were passing and you did all of your work for that day then you could do whatever you wanted and that lit up a light bulb in my head to start doing my work.

Another thing that our school would have is better attendance. Some parents don't care whether their child goes to school or not. So some students would have to stand in the gap if their parent wont. But if a student actually wants to go to school then maybe that will influence their parents that they need to change. But if a child wants to go to school because they know that if they do then they can do whatever and more then they were going to do at home. So if the principal chose policy 1 then they would have better attendance.

So i think if our school principal decided to go with policy 1 then we would have a lot of structured kids, a better grade point average, and we would have a lot of more kids that actually want to go to school. That is why i want our principal to choice policy and why.
