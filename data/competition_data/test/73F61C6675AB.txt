Dear STUDENT_NAME,

Cell phones in school can create a distraction to students, but there is a way to prevent this. You should allow the students to bring phones to school, and only use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones aren't used during class hours. This is a good idea because there will be no complaints from students. If the phones are going to be seen during class, then they will be taken away, and given back after they go to detention and you speak to their parents. If this happens a second time, then their phone will be taken away and given back after their two week suspension. If you take phones away for the whole day you will get complaints, people wont like the school, and the rules. The goal of a principle is probably to get the children to have good jobs, and be good at it. Taking away cell phones wont help people be better people. In the future, the students will have their phones so earthier way they will go on it.
