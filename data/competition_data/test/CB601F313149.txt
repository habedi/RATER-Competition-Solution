Dear principal,

I think your view of not letting students with a b average is horrible. Students need to have physical activities involved in there lives. P. e. is not enough to help kids get there full education. Without activities student will not be able to do a lot of things because they could get diabetes or they wont be ready for high school activities.

If some students don't get enough activities or are not active, they can suffer from any type of diabetes. If you have diabetes, it takes a lot out from your life. Such as eating types of foods or being physical. This is why i think you should not allow this to happen

Another reason that you shouldn't allow this to happen is because of if some students don't get a b average, they will not be ready for high school physical programs. In high school most physical programs can get you into a great college if you are good at it. Examples are football, baseball, basketball, and volleyball. Without these activities it limits what you can get a scholarship in. This Is another reason why i believe you shouldn't allow the b point average only to happen.

With this said i believe that up to a c point average should be allowed to play in physical activities. Its best for us, to stop diabetes, and to get us into great colleges.
