Imagine being required to stay in an area for an extended period of time while doing an activity you don't enjoy. That's a large amount of students who could feel this way while engaging in an extracurricular activity. Some people would like to use their time according to their agenda. Students shouldn't have to be required to participate in after school activities because they need to decide how to spend time. Additionally, reasons could include, finishing homework, disliking activities, or wanting to go home.

Finishing homework could be a major factor in why students would not like to attend after school programs. Because students often get large quantities of homework, they may want to finish it before participating in extracurricular activities so they don't have to worry about missing or unfinished assignments. Specifically, if a student wants to get their homework done, the programs would shorten the amount of time to finish their homework. This could also increase the stress put on a student from not having enough time to complete their work. Some students may not want to engage in extracurricular activities simply because they don't have the time to finish all assignments afterwards.

Another reason why people may not want to participate in after school programs could be that it does not seem enjoyable to them. It is unreasonable to do something you do not like because you could end up seemingly wasting your time for a grade. Adding on, some individuals may already be enrolled in other programs, they essentially would have to do multiple activities that can easily use their precious time. A handful of kids could also prefer to engage in a non related school event. Perhaps it'd be a tradition for a culture or activities that the school does not offer.

Lastly, a large amount of people just want to go home. Everyone needs to spend some time alone at some point. It is justifiable for students wanting to go home due to them not being able to relax in a school environment. People wouldn't be able to go to work and relax as if they would at home. It is also fact that kids would like to go home because they cannot stay in an area they don't want to be in. An example would consist of; someone staying at their work place for an extended period of time. Everyone wants to go home at some point for various reasons.

While extracurricular activities may be beneficial for a students health, many would not want to participate for lots of reasons. Students shouldn't have to do an after school program because it reduces the amount of time they have to finish an assignment, which could cause stress. Some people may also dislike the activities the school offers, while others could already be in a program outside of school grounds. Overall, many kids just want to go home after school and not do extra work. It is inappropriate for people to relax at school like they would at home. Therefore, students shouldn't have to participate in after school events because they need to decide how they want to spend their own time.Â
