The author supporting his idea by starting off with interesting facts to drawn in the reader. He then goes into talking about why that planet is named Venus. He stateds that the plant is known for having features like earth. That means that we could possibly live there? When you have the reader questioning themselves they get drawn in and what to learn more. Thats what makes a good artical.

He then talks the atmosphere in Venus. He says that the hard part about living there would just be the high levels of sulfuric acid. That causes the degrees to go up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The fact that Venus has the hottest surface in the hole solar system. Mercury is closer to the sun and yet Venus gets hotter than that. He gose on saying that scientists are discussing to further visit. I honetly think thats crazy. He says that astromoners are fascinated by Venus because of how similar it is to earth.

Long ago we tried to visit but since it was so far it was hard building a space ship that will go that far. NASA is working on a spacecraft that will alow people to go to Venus. It will be similar to a jet, since they fly fast. Thats the plan and I know that it wont be easy. The hardest part about it will be preparing he says. We can do our best but since we only have limited insight on the ground most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Either way that won't stop them from exploring more.

He gose on to talk more about what NASA is working on and gives you a history lesson while hes at it. He talks about World War ll and about how the modern technology let there learning about Venus expand more. Its was powerful, flecible and quick to what ever they needed. Thats how they got to learn about the atmosphere there. Around those times people started to care about how they got there information and where.

In the last paragrph his conclusion that Venus has a value. Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity. As humans we tend to always have questions about everything. Exploring is something we have been doing since we have been born. The authors did a very good job at letting me understand more about how our curiosity can lead us to grater things.
