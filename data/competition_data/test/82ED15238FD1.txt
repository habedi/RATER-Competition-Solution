There is a great challenge when it comes to exploring the planet Venus. However, some may believe that studying the planet is worth taking the risks that are inevitable. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers presented, by providing examples of the harsh conditions and new solutions to those conditions.

The author supports the idea that Venus is worth exploring by stating that astronomers are very intruiged by Venus because of it's similarity to planet Earth. The author also discusses that after the exploration of Venus, more intimidating conquests will be able to take place. After explaining this, the author then explains the dangers presented on Venus. For example, Venus has very high temperatures and sulfuric acid in it's atmosphere. To counteract against these challenges, NASA has the idea of using a blimp-like vehicle to avoid the hostile atmosphere and temperature. Another challenge would be the inability to use modern computers on Venus because of the harsh conditions. However, a solution to this would be the use of mechanical computers. The author elaborated on this idea by stating that, "...mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces". These are just two solutions from the researchers at NASA that can be used to combat the conditions Venus provides.

The author strengthed the idea by using various examples and providing concrete evidence. The author also provided facts from NASA as well as solutions to the challenges that arise from the conditions on Venus. This was done by elaborating on new technology that can be used despite the hostile conditions. This further strengthens the author's idea that the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to exploring Venus.
