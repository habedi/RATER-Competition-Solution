Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I would urge you on the matter of cell phone policies in a scholastic setting to approve policy 1. I believe policy 1 is the better choice because it is a compromise between teacher and student. Compromise is the best way to handle most situations.

Allowing students to bring there phones to school, but limiting there use to lunch periods and other free times while turning them off during class is a great compromise. All though technology is one of the biggest distractions to kids and teens today this compromise gives students better respect for class time as the teachers respect there social time.

Some may say social time comes after school and phones should not be allowed, but the majority of students would rebel anyways. Compromise is like being hungry once you 're full the temptation of eating isn't there anymore.

I would hope that I have convinced you to approve policy 1. As my closing statement I would like to say, if you give student what they want within reason they won't have to take it without one.
