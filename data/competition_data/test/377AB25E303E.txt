The author said that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. He tells us about how nobody survived on each misson but a few hours because of all the problems there and he said

"not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in 3 decades". Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide. It also is very hot, has one of the hottest surfaces and is the hottest in our solar system.

Yes it is dangerous goinf there but they want to see if life is on there and how different things are. The only reson they keep going back is because they think there was life and oceans just like on earth. They are all putting their life on the line just to figure this out. I think they want another place to take people and maybe start something there on a new planet. They also talk about how technology today is way better and could help more since its improved.

It is very dangerous and most of the reaserchers when they go there look for things to take back so they can see if life was there or is life can be there. The author says "many resherchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus" meaning they most likely won't give up on venus. "our thought on earth should not be limited by the dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
