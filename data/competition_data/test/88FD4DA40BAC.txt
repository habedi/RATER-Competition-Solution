Transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States. By driving less, the world can prevent further pollution and help the enviornment. Liming car usage can lower stress levels and pollution, and can help people be healthier as well.

Car usage is responsible for a lot of enviornmental problems, such as smog and carbon emissions. In France, public transportation became free for three days and people who drove were fined. After just 5 days without car usage, congestion was down 60 percent. President Obama is trying to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Studies show that Americans are becoming less interested in driving. A professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute said he thinks "something more fundamental is going on"

Without driving, people can be happier and healthier. A media trainer and mother of two stated that when she had a car she was "always tense" and after giving it up, "I'm much happier this way". Instead of driving cars, people often ride their bikes or walk to their destination. By trying to lower car usage, we are promoting exercise.

People feel the need to leave the house less, which is limiting car usage as well. Because of the Internet, communicating is easier and people feel more connected with each other, instead of driving to meet each other. Someone who stops driving for a while may not feel the need to keep doing it. Every year, there is a smaller percentage of young adults who get their license, because they are not interested in driving. They try to mostly go places that are walking distance, or to car-pool with their friends. Between 2001 and 2009, the amount of young people driving has decreased 23 percent.

Limiting car usage is a good idea because it promotes a healthier lifestyle, physically and mentally. It would also dramatically decrease the amount of pollution in the air, helping the earth. People are starting to drive less, which could be a positive change for the world.
