Cars are an important part of American Culture, but a superpower country using them has big consequences.Â  Pollution is getting worse and worse, and greenhouse gases are heating up our world. There are a few advantages to limiting car usage: safety is improved, and less pollution.

Paris recently enforced a tentative law that banned driving so as to clear the air of pollution. Warm days and cold nights were trapping the car emissions (Source 2). In the other side of the world, America's car selling stats are decresing. This could mean that cars will be used less and less in the U.S., which would definitely benefit smoggy places like L.A. and New York (Source 4).

Fun fact: automobile accidents are the leading cause of desth for teenage Americans.

Now, if we were to remove that, then there would be no deaths. Thus, safety is improved. Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford motor Company, found that "pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time... and improve safety". (Source 4) Ford and Mercedes are already calling themselves "mobility" companies with a wider product range.

The world would be so much happier with less deaths and breathable air, so cars should be limited. Days where driving is not allowed would be a great idea for America, like in Bogota, Columbia. The capital city of Bogota was devoid of traffic jams and violators who used cars faced 25 dolllar fines (Source 3). The goal was to promote smog reduction and safety. America should follow this example and try to set one for other countries, because planet Earth doesn't have much time left and humans need to all they can before they become extinct.
