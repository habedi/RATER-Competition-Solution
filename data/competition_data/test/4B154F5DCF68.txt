I think that students would be able to benefit by taking classes from home. Taking classes from home by online or video conferencing is almost the same as being in a classroom, but you can be in an area that you are familiar and relaxed in. These classes would provide a better learning environment for students all across the country. Online schooling is an underrated way where kids can learn from home while being more focused and less stressed.

First, online schooling will help kids have more focus during the course that they are taking. If you are at home, a place where you are every day, you will have more comfort being in that area alone working rather than in a classroom with kids you may not know and feel uncomfortable around. Being in a place that you feel comfortable is crucial when it comes to focus because then you aren't worrying about the social aspects around you, you are focusing on the work in front of you. If kids are taking online schooling from home, they will also have more focus because there are less distractions around them. During school, students are tempted to talk to their friends and not pay attention to what the teacher is saying. If you are taking the same course alone at home, there will be no distraction or feeling the need to talk to a friend, it would just be you being able to listen to your instructor, increasing students focus level.

Second, online schooling would benefit students by reducing stress. Students stress in school over lots of things such as projects, tests, and homework. They may also have social stress such as if they have a break up or get in a fight with their friend. By taking online courses, students will be able to listen to one course at a time instead of getting work piled on top of their plate from seven classes at once. If students had that opportunity, they would be able to organize and plan ahead more for tests and projects which would reduce their stress of feeling like they have so much work to do. Also, if students are taking online courses from home, it would allow them to be isolated. This is a good thing to relieve their social stress because they would notÂ be worrying about their friends or the arguments they may be having at the time. By doing this, students won't have to stress about seeing their friends or fitting in during the day, and can deal with whatever issues they may have after they are done with their classes. Again, this gives students more organized times to do what they need to do, and the more organized you are, the less stress you will have.

Some people might think that online schooling will cause more distractions such as being on their phone or watching TV. I stand by my opinion that there are less distractions because parents can now download applications on their phones to have phone locks during school hours and restrict what there is on the television so students can stay focused on their work. People may also say that online schooling will cause more stress by not being able to talk in person with their teacher and not seeing their friends enough. I also stand by my opinion on this because due to the advancements we have had in technology, there is no excuse why students can't send them an email, text, or set up a video conference with their teacher if they have a question or need help. Based on my experience from going to a public school, most teachers are willing to stay before or after school to help if a student has an issue, and i'm sure they would do the same if you needed to video conference. I think it is a good thing for students to limit their time with their friends during the week by doing online school alone, however, after classes students still have the option to go out with their friends, and if they have an activity after school, they can see them on the weekends.

In conclusion, I think that online schooling would benefit students in a way that increases their focus, and reduces their stress. These focus and stress issues would be resolved by being in a learning environment that you are most comfortable in, and can be isolated to primarily focus on schoolwork and not have to worry about social drama. That is why I think that taking classes online and video conferencing would benefit students.
