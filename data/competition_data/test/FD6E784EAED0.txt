Some schools require students to complete summer project to assure they continue learning during their break; however, theres a argument between teachers, and students if the summer project should be teacher-designed or students-designed. As a student, me and many of my peers believe that it should be student-designed. School projects are hard enough, so by having the students create their own design, it lets them have fun while completing their assignment because they have be creative, the assignment revolves around them and what they want it to be, and

The summer project should be student-designed because it allows the students to be creative and think outside the box. Students tend to do more work there interested in doing. Students papers will be exploding with patterns and colors . Everyones paper is gonna be unique or special in some kind of way. Theres all sorts of things you could add to your project. Stores like

HomeGoods i s an amazing place to get materials for this summer project. You could walk outside and pick up leafs from your neighbors yard, the choices are endless.

Another reason is because its all going to revolve around the student and what they want to do with the project design. Students typically dont like to do projects; therefore, we want to do everything we can to make this summer project exiting. The project is based around the students, so it gives them the motivation to get it done. Adding onto that, projects are boring for the majority of people ,and very stressful but if the summer project is student-designed its going to be enjoyable. me and my peers believe this will beneficial for the students and effective.

in conculion the student-design should happen this summer because its creative, the assignment revolves around them and what they want it to be, and its effective.
