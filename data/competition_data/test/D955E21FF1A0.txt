I would think that is not fare fore lot's of kids that do not have the fore that they need to get that high B. maybe some kid do not want to play sport and they have the B that they need and the kids that do have the need to play sports and activities and they have a C witch the principal is not letting those kinds of kid play anything than the principal would have to canals almost all the sports because there are not going to be that mush kid playing in the sports [I know that the principal is probably saying to her self "wall if they want to play sports that dad they would bring there grads up" but that not the case because there had' s will be fill with so much in formation all at one time so that way i think that is not a good way of making them put there grade up sure it not good if they fall the grade but at list a C would caver everything.
