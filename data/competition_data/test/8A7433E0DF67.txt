Imagine on the last day of school your teacher tells your class that she is assigning a summer project to you, most people would be upset about it because they want to enjoy their break but the teacher told them they could make there own project or she can assign them one most student chose to make up there own. I personally would do my own project Im not really a project person but i think i would have so much fun doing my own.

Some schools require summer projects i think the students should be able to make up there own project, although some students choose to get assigned one the other students want to make there own project up they can make one up about all kinds of things like if they visited somewhere they can do one about where they went, what they did, did they do it with family or friends. Students can still get learning out of making there own project. But some students dont really do anything over the summer break they might not have interest in going anywhere or doing anything so they will need there teacher to assign them one.

Students who are making there own project will probably have a hard time doing theirs because they have to go out and explore to get the information on the project but with the teachers assignment the students can use resources on a device to find their information. Some students that picked the teachers assignment may not have a device to use to help them find information on there project so they might have to take a teachers class book home over summer to help them but, some students may not be responsible enough to take one home with them. The students will still be learning while they do it because they are reading information out of a book or off line.

The students with there own project will most likely have more fun doing there assignment because they have to go out and explore for their project. Most students will probably do a project on where they went and what they did over break they also might have a friend with them that they did stuff with over break might want to help them with there project.

Although people still want to do there own project i hope this will help you understand doing your own project will be so much fun. So with that all being said i think it would be better to have a student to their own project they will have more fun out of it, they get to tell people about what they got to do over break, and last but not least they get to do a lot more activities.
