Dear principle,

You should let us use our phone at lunch and at free time. Here's why.

we need our phones because we use our phones for calling our parents to let them know we are ok. Also if we have the internet on our phones then we can do our homework there and then we wont have to carry any more books.

We need our phones to protect us and to help us in school and in our classes. Another reason is if we have phones we can write a summary on our phones so we wont waste paper . If we could use our phones in lunch then we could chat with our parents about what our homework is about.

Some people would say that phones are no good, but phone help us by calling our parent and to protect ourself from people stealing our homework.

So come on principle let us use our phones because we want to use our phone during lunch and our free time.

sincerely, your students
