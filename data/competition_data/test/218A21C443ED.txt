Dear Principal,

I think we should go with Policy 1 . It says that students should bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I know that most of student will also agree with the policy too because even if you say don't bring phones to school most students still will. Another reason that we should go with policy 1 is because when your leaving school what if your walking on the street and someone came and took something from you while you was walking with it. It wont be that big of a problem because gladly you will have your cell phone with you and you can call someone for help. Another reason is what if something happen to you and your cell phone happens to fall out your pocket then if someone generous pass you then they will take your cell phone and see if you have your parent number there or call the cops. As long as you don't take your phone during class then I think this rule would be really successful.

These are some of the reasons why I think we should go with Police.

Sincerly Yours.
