I think that it should be the students option in whether they want to do it or not. I'm not saying that they should never do it, but maybe once or twice a week will be good. For those who want to help pick up liter and help clean up the campus are helping the school whether we have a clean school or not.

But you cant hold a student after school to do that, because maybe that day there busy. But during school hours will be good. Then again students do need there class time to learn. I think it is a choice option whether they want to do it or not. Unless you get in trouble and HAVE to do it. Other then that I think students have the right to choose. I know what people do when they have community service because I have had to do that once and it was on a hot sunny day.

It felt good knowing your helping clean up the earth. But nothing is going to stop people from littering. There will not be one day when someone picks up trash from the ground other than throwing it on the ground. I'm not saying all people are like that, just some of the ones that cause pollution.
