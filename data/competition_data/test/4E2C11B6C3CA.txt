The face on mars has cause a lot of speculation in the past about it's origins and how it got there but many NASA scientists think it's just a Mesa or Buttle common earth landforms that are similar in construction as the face.

"Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, evidence NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancheint civilization on mars." If the facereally was made by aliens and NASA had discovered life other than our own, it would be hugely beneficial to them to tell the world. There would be people with lots of money wanting to see what NASA could find out about the face, and the people who made it.

" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the first image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."

NASA scientist say that the face is a natural landform, or the Mars equivalent to the Earthly landforms. Such asthe Mesa or Buttle and JIm Garvin, NASA's Mars Exploration Program says that " As a rule of thumb, you can discetn things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!".

Garvin also said " It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, Thats a lava dome that takes the form of and isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."

NASA scientists, through hard work and amazing photography have proven the Face on Mars mystery and written the final chapter to a truly interesting moment in NASA'S space exploration history.
