Technology is changing our world everyday. Though some people might prefer life without technology, it has made people learn and process information much quicker. With this, students have now started to take classes online instead of in the classroom. Some think that it is a terrible idea and others believe it's a great idea. Students should not be allowed to take classes online at home because it is proven that people can remember better when writing with a piece of paper and pencil, students will likely cheat, it's harder to find help and ask questions, and getting taught by teachers is much more helpful than teaching yourself.

Students would benefit more by going to school and learning in person because it is known that writing information down with a pen or pencil, on a sheet of paper, can stick in your memory much better then typing online. Distance learning would limit this and have kids not remember necessary knowledge as much. Though kids might get higher grades on an online course, their is a high chance that they didn't completely learn the material. Physically writing something down is much better off then typing something. Our world is evolving every day, so sadly technology will likely take over and this will likely end up not just being an option, but rather a neccesity.

Though cheating is prohbited in every school, students still have the urge to copy off somebody else's work. Having this, if students started taking online classes more, a high percentage of those students would decide to be better off cheating and getting a high grade. Since the class would be online, students would find it easier to cheat by searching for answers online, instead of studying and trying to learn the subject. If a student was to be in a classroom with an adult teacher watching, he wouldn't cheat and know he'd have to study and learn the information in order to succeed. This is a major point because if students started to take online classes more instead of regular classes, they could end up not really learning anything and have a hard time succeeding in the real world. Though many students might not know, if they choose to cheat their way out of school, life is going to come hitting hard.

Many students don't get a certain subject and need help to process and gain that knowledge. If students were to take a class online, or with video conferencing, thier would be less people they could ask questions too. Though video conferencing would give a student someone to ask questions, that would really be their only easy source of help. Asking questions is very critical for a student to do. If a student wants to learn then he/she will ask questions to a grown up taht can help. Say a young boy was taking an online class and he had no idea what he was trying to do. If he isn't video conferencing, but is taking the class online, who would he be able to ask for help? If his parents don't know how to help, what would that student do to get free help? The main point is that it would be harder for a student to ask questions if they were taking an online class.

These students are very young and unexperienced. At school, students would learn from exerienced adults and be able to get help almost anytime they need it. Though many students could end up being better off teaching themselves, having information spoken and explained to the students would increase the chances of them memorizing that information. It has been proven that getting taught from others is better than teaching yourself. If a student is getting taught by a teacher in person, they can learn off someone else's perspective. Learning from an experienced grown up would be much better off on the fact that they know what they are talking about and can help with everything that student needs help with.

Students would benefit more from learning at school instead of taking classes online because using a pen or pencil helps remember information easier, cheaters, and harder to ask people questions. With the advancement of technology, it could very likley end up being that students can and will start taking classes online. Since our world today is techonology based, schools will later on be affected and likely end up being online. I do believe that some students would be better off taking a course online, but I believe that their should be a valid reason on why.Â
