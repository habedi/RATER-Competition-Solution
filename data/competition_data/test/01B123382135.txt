The Electoral College, the real group of electors, is a process in which the public selctes the electors. These electors then cast there votes for the President and Vice President. In total there is 538 electors that participate in the process and  a majority of 270 votes as necessary to elct the President and the Vice President. These electors are chosen from each state, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you Senators. For the District of Columbia, since it's not a real state, it is awarded three electors due to the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution. The time to vote for electors is every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday. Some people disagree with this system, but the founding fathers of the U.S. had a reason for creating the Electoral College.

During a campain a candidate might have a lot of appeal in one area. For example a candidate might hae a lot appeal in the north where there is barely  any state that has more than eight electoral votes and confirm that the votes will go him. Those states with very low electoral vote count will not be enough to hit 270 total votes. This drives the candidate to spread his campain to other locations to get more votes, not only for that but because he has no reason to stay in those comfirmed states. So thismakes everyone across the nation feel that there votes do count.

The opinion that goes against the Electoral System claims that the system isn't democratic and dosen't let the people directly vote for there candidate. Or another claim is that the people don't know who the electers are or what there intentions are.

It is true that it's not democrtic or that the electors are not well known. But the electors that the people vote for are ususally picked out by the candidate or the candidates party, which are the people that you vote for. And by the time you got to vote for the electors they already are comfirmed of who they are going to vote for so that gives no reason to doubt it.
