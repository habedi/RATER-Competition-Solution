The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. While Venus is simple to see from the distant, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. I'm here to show you both sides of studying Venus.

Venus is often reffered to as Earth's "twin", its the closest planet to Earth as far as density, size, and occasionally in distance too. Scientists believe it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and inclides familar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters.

Venus is really attracted by Scientist, although it has some factors that prove as challenges for them. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon diocide blankets Venus. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric presssure is 90 times greater then what we experience on our own planet. Also notable, Venus has the Hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Murcury is closer to our sun.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. The scientists want to use a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or s miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.

In all therory studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The adventure provides numerous factors that contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study. But NASA's studies provide that solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earths levels. Basically its saying not its not going to be easy but its survivable for humans.
