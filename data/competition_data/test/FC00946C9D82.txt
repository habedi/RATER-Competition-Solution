In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author supports the idea of studying Venus despite that it has many dangers. The first way the author supports this claim is that not a single spaceship has landed on Venus in more than three decades. The second claim the author makes is that Venus's surface has very hot tempratures. The third way the author supports this is that he states that astronomers are fascinated by Venus.

Not a single spaceship has landed on Venus in three decades. The article says that no spacecraft has survived the landing more than a few hours. NASA wants to send humans the Venus despited this fact.

The second claim is that Venus has very hot tempratures. The surface of Venus averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is over 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temprature of any planet in our solar system. The author states that these conditions are not easy, but they are survivable for humans.

The author lastly tells us that Astronomers are fascinated by this planet. He states that it was once the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. Venus today has some features that are analogous to Earth. For example, the planet includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

Despite that Venus could be dangerous to physically study, the author does support it. The planet is hot, no spaceship has landed on it in decades, but it is still fascinating for astronomers. Venus has value, and if it is studied more, astronomers will gain insight on the planet. At the end of the article the author states that "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." That is how the author suggets that studying Venus is a worthy persuit, despite the dangers.
