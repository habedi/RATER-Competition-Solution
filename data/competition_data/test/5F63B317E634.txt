Dear TEACHER_NAME,

The cell phone policy I believe is the better choice for the school and the students is Policy 1. Policy 1 allows students to bring phones to school and allows students to use them during lunch and other break or free times, but they must be turned off in class. I believe Policy 1 would be a better decision because it has a good balance of freedoms and restrictions. Let me explain.

Policy one will allow students to freely use phones during non class times. It is my belief that if the students are given more freedoms instead of just restrictions it will reduce the chance of them violating the rules of the school on cell phones. It will also allow students to get their ambitions of telling the friends or peers something that the student wants to tell, but normally on a no cell phone policy would not allow unless they use theirs phones. Policy 1 would minimize the chances of a students losing focus during class time because of a desire to speak or communicate with their friends. Policy one would allow schools to still monitor cell phone use without losing control over it. The teacher will still be able to teach the students without worrying about someone not paying attention to them and their teachings. The administrators would still be able to do their jobs.

You are probably thinking that if policy 1 is approved students would still use their cell phones on class even thought they have total freedom to us the phone during breaks and lunch periods. Yes there is the risk of students still using their phones in class but what would life be without risks. Life would be boring and dull. Someone once told me it is better to live with freedom and danger than to live suppressed and safe. In my opinion Policy 1 would be the better decision it balances the rights of the school and the rights of the students.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
