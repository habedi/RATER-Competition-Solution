To the principal,

I do not think it is fair for you to take away sports to students who have a low grade. You should tell the teachers to work harder on the students so they can work hard to get a high grade. In addition, I think this policy will motivate the students to make there grades better by going to after school and paying more attention to the teachers. Furthermore, If the students don't get motivated and they cant get any exercise then there going to gain weight and you will get complains from the parents because of this. For example, the parents might come to the school and complain but if you don't do anything there is a possibility that the parent might sue you. Finally, The peers will go on strike and will not come to school.

Continuing with this policy will make you look bad and i suggest for you to not do it. Their is a slight chance that you might get fired. In addition, The school will be shut down because of all the low grades in the school. Furthermore, It will affect your job as principal and other schools might not hire you because of this incident. For example, You would be underlined as a bad principal and any chances of getting into another school are one in a million. Finally, The students will dislike you for what you did to them and the school.
