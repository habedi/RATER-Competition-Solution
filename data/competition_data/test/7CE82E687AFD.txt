Dear Principal,

I think we should change the grade requirements to B average. We're in Junior High School and the teacher's want the students to make Honor Roll or Principals Honor Roll. The coaches here and teachers are requiring students to have a B average to join any sport or activities. If they can't meet those requirements, they can not participate unless they bring their grades up. The coach for basketball is requiring the students have Honor Roll by the end of the quarter.

Students that go to this Junior High School, are meeting the requirements on being back on the school team or in any activity that involves students staying in school or after-school. For instance, the student council kids need to meet the standards on talking in the promotion. If they have anything below a B average, they can't speak in the promotion. If their grade is good, they can promote and talk during the promotion.

I think we should change the school policy from C average to B average. That's what I think the School and the School Board should do. That's a wonderful idea and we should do it right now. It's time to make changes around the School. This is the right time to start thinking about it. You should think about it and tell the coaches and teachers when you change your mind.
