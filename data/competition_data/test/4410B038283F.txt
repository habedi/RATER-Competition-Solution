Dear Principle,

All students should perform community service because that will help out the community, our planet, and us. Not all students care about keeping our community clean and helping others, but if they are required to do it they don't have a choice. I support you with the idea of all students to perform community service.

First of all not all students care if our community is clean or not. They don't really like doing community service because they don't get paid to help out. But if they were required to do community service then they wouldn't have a choice. Which then our community would be clean so when purists came they will like to come back again. If i were to go somewhere and there was trash on the streets and was really dirty I wouldn't like to go back to that place.

Secondly doing community service would also help our planet. If we keep our community clean and recycle then we wouldn't be throwing away so much garbage. Recycling is very important but not everyone does it. If we were to do community service we would personally go to peoples houses and ask if they had things to recycle. That way if they don't have time to go recycle there things well take them.

Thirdly community service isn't just about cleaning its about helping others to. For example tutoring elementary students, taking care of them when there's a meeting at school, or organizing a fund razer. Some kids don't have older siblings to help them with there homework so we could go help. Also when there's meetings at schools but the parents bring there children but are too busy taking care of them that they hardly pay attention. If we were to go help we could take care of them and do fun activities with them. Another thing is we could organize a fund razer of food so when the holidays come and those who don't have family could have a dinner.

To sum things up having all students perform community service if a great idea and i would like to do it. Sometimes i just go home after school and just watch television when instead i could be doing something for my community to make it look better and help those in need. I think you should require all student to perform at least 5 hours of community service before passing grade.

Sincerly
