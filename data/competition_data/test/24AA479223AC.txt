Dear Principal,

I have recently heard that you are thinking about letting kids use their cell phones at school during lunch periods and any other free time they have, as long as the cell phones get turned off during class time. I personally think this would be a extremely good idea, and i happen to know lots of people would greatly appreciate it. You might ask why i think this would be a good idea to do. So, I'll just go ahead and tell you.

All kids love their cell phones, and most importantly, love to text their friends. So, they're always sneaking their phones out to answer a text message during class, in the hallways, the bathrooms, and lunch rooms. Kids text in laying in bed, driving down the highway, at friends houses, while they're out eating somewhere, and even in the shower! The only place they can't text is at school. Why can't they? As long as they follow your rule about having to put up their phones while in class doing work, they should be allowed to do it as much as they want. Most teachers don't even really care if the students have their phones out when they aren't working. The only reason we can't is because you have a rule against it. Other schools let the students have their phone out in between classes and at lunch, Why not us?

One good thing about students being allowed to text during lunch and other free times, is then it would be about ten times quieter in both the cafeteria and the hallways. Instead of kids yelling across everybody else out there just to tell one of their friends something, they could just get out their cell phone and text it to them. Also, kids would be so busy texting and answering all the messages they got while they were in class, they would be too busy to stop and talk to their friends; so they wouldn't be tardy to class. Wouldn't you love having quieter hallways and less people being tardy to their classes? I know I would!

Of course there would be at least few kids that would want to abuse the opportunity and not put their phone up during class time, or stay out in the hallways or bathrooms so they could text. There always is. So, if you catch them doing this, all you have to do is just take their phone away from them and make them pay to get it back (like you do now). I'm pretty sure most kids would learn their lesson, and just use the time they have instead of trying to sneak off, and ending up getting caught.

In conclusion, I truly think it is at everybody's advantage that we be allowed the little bit of freedom of being allowed to use cell phones during our free time and in the cafeteria. It would be quieter in the hallways, classrooms, and lunch rooms. People wouldn't be sneaking their phones out during class, and people wouldn't be tardy to class just because they were telling one of their friends about something that happened. You should think about it.

Sincerely,
