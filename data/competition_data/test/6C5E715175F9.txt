Policy 1 allows kids to use there cell phone which is good but you don't want kids to over use the policy by taking pictures and stuff and Policy 2 states that students are not allowed to use cell phones but I think that the best policy is policy 2 because kids cant use there phone which allows them to not cheat on test and stuff. There both great policy's and you should do both policy's what you should do is allow kids to use phones but when they enter the class room they should give all there phones to the teachers so that the teachers knows they cant text or cheat on test. Here is an example when the bell rings all phones are handed to the teacher as the teacher waits by the door then the teacher takes the phones and puts it in his draw and when the class is over the teacher gives them there phones back by row, that way its not a full on mess when they come and get there phones.

The same rules would go for P.E. because that is one of the places pictures can be taken at. For example a student walks in and starts taking pictures and sending them to people so as soon as they get in any class at all they give there phone in to the teacher. Policy 2 could help with that and Policy 1 would be were kids only get there phones at lunch, break, and halls. That way they only get a short time to be on there phones or whatever. If students could do this then it would be cool. I think students would like it a lot. The school could still have as many rules as they want that is what I would do but you may also look at it different.

I hope you take this in too thought if so then that would be cool. Students I beat would like this a lot cause not only do they get use there cell phones but they also get to be able to concentrate in class. This could ether be a really good play or a really bad one but i would say its a really good plan. Plus it has Policy's 1 and 2 in them. It may not be a good policy but you never know till you try for your self and if its worth a try then its worth a try. I hope this helped your school out if you do this but we will nev
