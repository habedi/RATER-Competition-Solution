The author supports this idea well and its about studying is Venus is a worthy pursuit. Even if there are some dangers to it they are not as big as to the reasons we should and without fixing the problems on why we can't. There are many reasons to studying Venus and visiting and its because there are possibilities that it could happen. Venus is the most like planet to earth but it'll just take time to get there. And we could go to Venus because it is the planet next to us and closer to the sun but then sometimes we do get closer to Mars depending on how it rotates but Vensu does have the most similarities to Earth.

The only thing is that we need to have the right spacecraft to make it to Venus and have it last because some don't last that long or they break. No spacraft has ever survived the landing longer than a few hours. But they want to know if the air in that planet is accessible to us to the point where there could possibly be life, or discover new things. Before Venus had was covered with ocean and could support life, but Venus today has some of those features, but are mostly a surface of a rocky sediment. But when wanting to go to Venus comes challenges because not everything is easy to do because the temperature there goes up to 800 degress fahrenhiet and the the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we expirience and the stuff in Venus are things that our body couldn't handle because we don't handle those type of things in Earth. But the author still wants to believe there could be away and will make sure there will be.

So i think there could be a chance to go to venus and i thik there should because it would be a good idea to discover new things and make new changes. If it's not now I know it will be later on in the future. The author made good points to why Venus is a worthy persuit dispite of the dangers that come with it. It is also a human curiosity to see what is really inside of Venus. the author says," Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limitted by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to me the very edges of imagination and innovation", and that's why he would want to do things out of his way even if it seems impossible.
