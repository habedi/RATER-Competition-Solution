Dear Principal,

In my opinion I believe that students should be required to perform community service. I think they should have to do this because helping others can be very helpful. There are many people in this world who need help, but don't have the luck to have any. I myself hate seeing people struggle, especially children. If they don't have a well educational process, it can hugely effect them in life. Do we really want that to happen?

Not only do children need volunteers to teach them, but our city also needs help. The students should be required to do a little bit of community service at least twice a week. Not only will it do good for the children, but for everyone living around us as well. We can make it possible for people to play and live in a clean healthy environment without trash and filthy things rolling around town.

There are also old people that could really use some help. Being old isn't easy, so I've been told. With the help of one child there to accompany them, it can make their lives less stressful and more relaxing. For example, if something was to happen to one of the elderly, there would be no-one there to either help them, or get help. Helping the elderly would possibly be a huge accomplishment due to how much care and attention they need; not to mention, companionship would really do them good.

Hopefully this has lead you to consider making all student required to perform community service. It can make them much better people as life goes on. One small change can lead to an even bigger one. Not only will the students be helping themselves by doing good, but they will help make other lives worth living for.

Sincerely,
