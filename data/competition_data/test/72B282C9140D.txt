After reading this article I have to a decision that I am in agreement with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. In a classroom setting full of students there can be many emotions. Some are facially expressed. Some are verbally expressed. And some just aren't expressed at all.

In a classroom there are always emotions being expressed in some sort of way. Most of the time we can recognize someone is happy or sad or angry whatever it may be, but what if someone has multiple emotions at one time. They're showing mixed emotions and sending mixed signals? Will we be able to recognize the emotions being expressed? In the majority of these cases we will not.

Fear not,for our fellow scientist have be working on a software that can detect any emotion even mixed emotions. In paragraph 4 Dr. Huang lets us know that the facial expression for each emotion is universal even though individuals show varying emotion. In paragraph 5 he gives an example of how you can tell when your friend is sad but you can have trouble identifying other expressions on that friends face.

In paragraph 6 he said what if a classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. That would be an awesome piece of technology.

In conclusion I think that having this software would be an enrichment to learning environment in schools around the world. This software could possibly prevent suicide. The root of suicide is mainly because of feelings and emotions not being expressed.
