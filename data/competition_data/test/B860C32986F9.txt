First, i think it's a good idea because, it's more comfortable for us (students) and we have our personal teacher; the students can learn more easily, in my opinion i prefer more take classes in my house with my personal teacher, although the technology every day make our life more easily, but not every-body prefer this idea, some students like assist to the school because their have your friends there, others don't like the idea to learn in their houses, one reason that i prefer learn in my house is i dont need wake up at 5AM, i have enough friends and i don't need to walk or take the bus to going to the school, but not every-body are equal.

Causes of consequence of these are:

* You probably are aisle.

* You don't like the school.

* Your parents thinks about the conferring or video classes.

*You feel more comfortable your house.

* You don't like how the teachers explain.

All of this causes of consequence show us the reality about why students prefer more video conferring than school, with your personal teacher you can ask over, and over again no matter what; he/she know that you are the only student so, in the school you can ask about over ad over again but it's not the same, there are more students and you teacher just have approximately 1 hour with 30 minute just for one subject, i think it's not enough time to learn. In the school there are many distractions like friends, boyfriend/girlfriend and others smallest details.

Why I'm going to the school? I'm going to the school for those reasons:

*Baseball programs

*I don't know how the online or conferencing working.

* My parents do not have enough money to pay it.

*I can't speak the language.

*In the school i have all my friends.

to sum up, the school bring to us every things that we need, like pen, scissors, piece of paper and others things. So if you prefer the school more than video-conferring you need take the bus, wake up at 5AM or 6AM, take a shower in the morning, the most probably you are tired at the end of the day. My brother did the college in a web site, i always ask, questions like that: How do you feel taking class in your house? are you always understand? Is it easy or hard? the last time that i saw him he told me yes i like the program, it's not difficult, i have more time to work, in my opinion is easy, but not every-body think equal that others.

In Conclusion, the school teach you about the values, things that you really need in the future, the video conferencing program just teach you the assigments and you need to pay it, the school are free and you can participate in sport programs like baseball, football, tennis whatever you want, the confering programs you can understand more easily and ask what-ever you want the thing is learn, in the school you can makes friends and share culture, Example: i am dominicane, i share my culture with my salvadorians friends. the conferencing programs doesn't have time to take it, in the school you need to stay there at 6:40 AM, the school bring you all of you need. finally i think is most better assits to the school.
