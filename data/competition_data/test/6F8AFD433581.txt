Scientists go to great lengths to try to learn more about the world around us. Whether it be through rockets that go into outer space or simple lab experiments; they are willing to spend a large amount of money to achieve their scientific goals. The author also believes that scientists should invest in the advancement of scientific knowledge. The author of the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" believes that Venus should be pursued, despite its many dangers. The author supports this idea through the use technology, the planet's future desires, and Earth and Venus' similiartiy to support his idea well.

The author supports his claim through the use of explaining how Venus is somewhat similar to Earth. He says, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." He says this so that humans will become curious about these features and will want to learn more about Venus. He continues by writing, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." The author uses this quote to make people more curious about what had happened to all the life on Venus. This can make more people want to study and learn about Venus. Then, the author compares Venus and Earth today by saying, "Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." He is explaining what is currently there and is trying to increase people's interest with Venus. Thus, the author uses Venus' similarity to Earth to make people wonder what had happened to make it how it is today to convince others and to support his idea that Venus is worth pursuing.

In addition to that, the author also uses the advancement of technology to suppot the idea. He writes, "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray." Through this, he is saying that if we were to persure Venus, we may also make an advance in technology and develop new things, such as this blimp like structure. He also mentions that, "Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels." This means that some of the solar power may be harnessed from the atmosphere of Venus and be used for other uses, such as powering some technology. He also says, "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus." Therefore, if humans discover and invent machines that can last long enough know, we would have this technology for further use and can continue to advance in the future. Which, this helps justify his desire for the continuing study of Venus.

The author also uses Earth's future desires and wants to try to support this idea. He tries to make us imagine how Venus could be useful to us in the future of space travel, due to its proximity to Earth. He writes, "Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel." He believes that Venus can be and should be used in long term space travel, therefore we must continue to try to study it. The author also believes that the world should continue to persue Venus because of human's and their want for more knowledge. The author writes, "Striving to meet the challenge present by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." He uses to fact that humans will, eventually, come to another problem that they can not solve. He believes that they should not just stop trying, but that humans must adapt and try to advance technology get past these endeavors. This is exemplified when he says, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." Therefore, the author uses humans' desires to continue to gain knowledge and future to explain why the planet should continue its investment in Venus.

In conclusion, the author supports his idea that Venus is worthy of pursuit despite its dangers is supported by a myriad of reasons and has a good amount of supporting evidence. His support is effective due to him explaining the benefits of our continuation of making technological advances, the fact that we may encounter future problems done the road, and the scientific reasons to study Venus. Therefore, the support he uses is good and makes a good argument about why the planet should continue to persue Venus.
