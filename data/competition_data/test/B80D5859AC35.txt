Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I personally think that Policy 2 is not a good idea at all. I can see where your coming from but students after school need there phone to get a hold of there parents. Then again I don't agree with Policy 1 either because students shouldn't be aloud to use there phone during school at any time. If a teacher sees any kid with there phone out they should keep it until there parents come pick it up. Policy 1 would be a good Policy if we don't get to use our phones at all.

By taking the students cell phones maybe they'll stop texting during school. I really think that kids will stop texting in school if we get a little bit more strict. Policy 1 just needs to have some small changes. This is an example of a new Policy 1. Policy 1: Allow students to bring there phones to school, but turned off and put away. I am trying to help the new policy for cell phones. Thank you for your time.

From,

STUDENT_NAME
