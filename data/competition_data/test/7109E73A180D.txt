With the education system constantly evolving, our children are exposed to a myriad of different ways to learn. Whether it be public, private, or even home school, with this many options, it can be difficult to decide which could be the most beneficial for their development. Although these systems are successful, there are some schools that offer distance learning, a way for students to pursue their studies from home through online classes or with video conferencing. This concept can benefit students by cutting out the need for transportation, ease stress, and even making class more comfortable. However, even with it's multitude of pros, there are also cons such as if WiFi is not present, the many distractions of the home, and the loss of the joy of making new friends at school. Distance learning can be a successful aid to a child's learning experience, but with the cons in mind, there are evidently many challenges one must overcome in order to pursue it.

Although the vast majority of schools offer buses to transport the children to school, there are some students who live outside of bus districts, and, therefore, have to drive to get there. Even if they do ride the bus, what if they miss it and there's nobody home to drive them? Fortunately, distance learning eliminates this conflict, as they wouldn't need to travel anywhere to pursue their education. This not only eases the stress off the student, but also the parent. No longer would they have to worry about how their child is getting to school. Regarding easing stress, distance learning can also eliminate the stress of school itself. Assuming they're comfortable in their own home, studying can be much easier and more relaxing. Although comfortable learning brings it's benefits, it also brings it's issues.

A comfortable and cozy environment can be the perfect place for students to study and do their school work. Students such as myself, however, can become extremely distracted by their surroundings and loose focus easily. Assuming they weren't doing a video conference with a teacher or a parent wasn't present to supervise, students can easily watch TV or go on their devices when they should be doing their work. Regarding the internet, what if the child's family doesn't have access to WiFi? This factor could ultimately eliminate the possibility of pursuing distance learning, as all of it is to be done on the internet. If only those fortunate with access to WiFi and can afford devices can do this type of schooling, then everyone else would be forced to either go to a normal public school or even no school at all.

Although distance learning has it's multitude of perks and benefits, I would not wish to switch from my public school in order to pursue it. If I did, I would loose all the wonderful friends I have made over the years. Making friends and building relationships is what makes going to school fun and amusing. Although some can argue that having friends in your classes is distracting, which is true, but working together with them can make learning easier and more exciting. It's the friends you make that create school to be so much more rememberable; school appears boring without them.

There is no such thing as the perfect school; it doesn't exist. Whatever path a student decides to take in order to accomplish their studies, they will inevitably have to work hard and diligently to make it work for them. Distance learning can help students succeed, but what brings benefits always brings challenges. What brings challenges, however, will always bring solutions.Â
