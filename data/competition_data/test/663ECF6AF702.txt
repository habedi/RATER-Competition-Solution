Dear , TEACHER_NAME

I disagree with your consideration of only letting students with a B average play sports. I don't think that its fair for you to only let students that only have a B average to play sports.

The reason i think that is because many students that don't have a B average love to play sports like me, but that's beside the point. I also think that you just letting students that only have B average play a sport will probably not succeed because I know a lot of students that only have B average hates sports. Students with only a C average will probably hate the fact that they can't play their favorite sport because their grade. I would probably think that boys with C average would really hate the fact that cant play football, basketball, baseball and stuff like that because of what their grade is.

Some things I do agree with you in is the fact that they need to bring their grade up. I'm not saying that you should let students with an grade point average of a D or an F because that would just be wrong. I also think that its right to let them be able to bring their grade up and make it better. So what I'm really trying to say is to give them a chance before you go and judge them.
