Being able to attend class every day isn't always the easiest things for some students. Life just gets in the way sometimes. School also takes around 6 hours out of a students day which leaves them very little time to do anything else. One thing some schools are doing is offering students the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students could benefit if schools offered distance learning as an option because online classes eliminate the need for a student to be present in class, gives them more time in the day to do other important things and can even help teach a student some responsibility.

Giving the students the option to take classes online allows for them to still get work done and on time even if they are sick, have doctors appointments, or even have a family emergency.

Some students may even miss a few days to even a week of class leading to them having a large amount of work they have to make up while also doing the work that the teachers are currently assigning. Allowing students to take classes online can help students eliminate the physical attendance factor and lets the student work from nearly anywhere with a computer and internet connection. And having the ability to have classes online means a student can help reduce the amount of missing assignments which would overall help improve their grades.

Online courses also give the student more free time in the day to do other important things. For example, some students work jobs to try to raise money for college but often dont get paid very much due to the little amount of time they get to go to work. With the opportunity to take class online, a student can get most or all of their schoolwork done in a smaller portion of the day and still have plenty of time in the day to go work, take care of younger siblings, and tend to other important things. Most students have to sit in a school for up to 6 hours a day, but with the option of having online classes a student could get schoolwork done within a couple hours and have the whole day to do what they need to do. Being able to get schoolwork done in a smaller amount of time benefits students because it gives them more time in the day to do what they want or need to do.

One issue that one could argue against giving students the option to take classes from home is that some kids may not be responsible in doing their work because of distractions or lack of motivation because of a less structured environment. While this is true, it is the students responsibility to make sure their work is done and turned in on time, even in regular public schools. And while the online classes may be less structured, online courses usually have required times that a student must be active which would provide some structure for the student to get their work done. But having a less structured teaching environment could actually help make the student more responsible because the student will be given due dates and requirements that must be met, otherwise they would start to fail the course. And learning responsibility is a great thing for students as a way to prep for college and life outside of school. Having online classes as an option still benefits students, even tho less structured, it still teaches some responsibility.

Students are likely to miss a few days of school, and some work jobs and have to help with family income. The option for students to take their classes online is very beneficial to them. Life just gets in the way sometimes, but giving choice to take online classes can significantly help students. There isnt much of a downside to these forms of classes. Overall schools that offer online classes to students benefit them by giving them more time to take care of their own things outside of school, recover from illnesses, and inadvertently teach them to be a little more responsible.
