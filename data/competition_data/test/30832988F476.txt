In my opinion I would say that if students attend classes from home the student won't take that advantage of learning; For example if the student take a math class online it would affect them by not learning and doing others things at home that it won't let you focus. Taking online classes can also affect you because you can easily find the answers online. Which that leaves out that you pass and take that credit, but you really didn't learn anything.

I know that if students attend classes from home they won't even try. Students will just give up and find the answers online that way they can just finish. Another thing is that they can say I will take it later and forget it to do it. And keeps saying that they will do it but forget every single time and thats when its start getting bad results,late and not pass and learn. Some student they work or they have others things to do,so they will just try to take the classes fast and rush and not learn. Students that take online at home it can be a problem because you won't able to concentrate and focus on what you are learning if their is noises at home or if you little sister or brother they won't let you focus. Online you have no one to help you accept only if you cheat which that causes bad situation.

I have many reasons why student should attend classes in school. My first reason is that students learn more the way the teacher teaches because the teacher can explain you a lot times as you want and explains as many ways you want until you get it and understand. In online their is only one example or one directions that shows you of how to do it and explains you, But thats can be a problem because some student will want to know for more direction and to explain well or other wise they won't do anything. However its better to attend classes in school. My second reason is that teacher gives you homework or projects to get more practice and be ready for test or quiz, that way you learn something. Lastly if you attend all your classes in school and you have homework or projects you can work with others student and get more ideas together get to know real people and talk.

As how was saying it better to attend all classes in school because you learn more many ways and get to know more people to talk. Students will take it serious and be really focus. I really think that students should just go to school and not take any classes online so they can be successful.
