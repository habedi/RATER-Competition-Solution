Abraham Lincoln once said, " it's not about the days in your life, It's about the life in your days." Joining the after school program can make each day more exciting. In my past I have done many extra curricular activities such as, rugby, soccer, knitting, and many more, and It's the thing I look forward to most in the day! I think participating in the after school program is good, because you could meet new people and learn new skills.

one reason for joining is that you could meet new people. Meeting others is always fun, especially if that person shares the same interests as you. when I was in fifth grade I met one of my close friends in knitting, she shared the same interests as me and even taught me techniques when knitting.

Another reason is learning new skills. Improving and expanding on your skill setÂ can help you try and learn new things you never thought you would do. When I was in fourth grade my friend signed me up to do rugby, I really didnt want to, but then I tried it out and learned how to play, and till this day rugby is my favorite sport.

I agree that participating in after school can help you make friends and learn new things. I think Abraham Lincoln was right, by doing after school activities you are making your life more eventful. In all I think its is great to join an extra curricular activity.
