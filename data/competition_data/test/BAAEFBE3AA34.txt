Dear Principle,

I think that students should be able to bring phones to school because when student are at school they may feel sick and need to text or call their parent to go home.

There is also very little reason for there to be no phones. The only reasons I can think of are texting during class or calling people during time when they could be working.

So in this matter I think that the pros outweigh the cons of this idea.

Kids feel safer when they have a phone because when they are walking home from school or going from class to class they know that help is just a phone call away if they get into trouble.

So to conclude this letter I think that when deciding whether or not to enforce these rules then I think that you should enforce some of the rules but still allow the students to bring them to school.

If you are just looking at the cons of this rule then enforce some rules like no phones in class and if they are seen then they need to be taken away for a week and the parents must pick them up from the office.

So don't let the bad parts ruin all the good things about this idea.
