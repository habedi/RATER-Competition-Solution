Dear Principal,

To some people community service is very important but to others it's just a waste of time.

If the students don't want to do community service then they shouldn't be forced to because they might just mess the others up or send a negative attitude to everybody else who is trying to make our community better.

The people that like doing community service are hard working people who like the community to be nice and clean.

The people that don't care probably have something to do with the way the community looks right now.

I have some friends that don't care about community service and I have some that do it because they want to be a good cause.

Cleaning up our environment is very helpful to many people, animals, and even plants.

Some things my friends do to help with community services is read to younger students or to the elderly, they also clean up around local parks and places were people go so they can have a nice visit so they will go back to them places.

They also help people they need help.

Sometimes they even pick up trash along the roads so people can see they beautiful flowers and plants around the roads.

I really don't think you should make people do community service though, because if they don't want to then they probably want.

Even if you make them, they will just stand there.

People don't care about anything these days but themselves and I think that's the bad thing but its just the way it is and some others love to help and share in our community.

Your Student,
