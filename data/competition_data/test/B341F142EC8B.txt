Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am a representative of the many students in our school. Being a student myself, I understand exactly what my fellow classmates are thinking. And I believe that students shouldn't have to do what they don't want to do. So, I'm afraid to say that I'm against making it mandatory for students to do community service. My reasons for this decision are that students already have enough to handle with homework, some students aren't exactly good with helping other people, and some students just plain live in a bad neighborhood.

First off, I would like to say that students just don't have the time to do community service. The amount of homework the average student receives a day is enough to last them until dinnertime. That ranges from three to four hours after school ends! And by the time they actually have time to do community service, it's already dark. Including the fact that most students are involved in sports and clubs, it could be nine P.M. before a student has any free time of their own. Also, having students do more than what they already do for school after it's over will put them in a lot of stress. Students are already stressed with what they do now. And stress causes bad moods and bad grades. So really, making community service mandatory would end up doing more harm than good.

Secondly, you have students who aren't good at helping other people. They may not get along with people, such as those who prefer to work alone, or they might not be able to do any service because of diseases. Some students have Diabetes, preventing their blood pressure from getting too high or low. Others may have Asthma, preventing them from doing to much work. Even still, there are students with many other illnesses that can and will prevent them from doing work. Students who just plain don't work well with others shouldn't have to. Instead, they should be at home working on any projects that come to interest with them.

Then we have those neighborhoods where it's just not safe to leave your home. This may be because of gangs living in and around those neighborhoods, traffic, or bad neighbors. I know that you only want the safety and wellbeing for you students at school, but why not at home too. Don't make them go out into a street filled with cars or guys with weapons just to do some community service. Is a school assignment really worth the safety of your students?

So, as you now know, students don't have the time for community service, they may not be able to do community service, or it may be endangering their very lives. These are only a few of my many reasons for going against mandatory community service. Think about just how many students you'll be causing problems for. You might even lose future students if you make community service mandatory. Be sure to consult me on any problems you may have with my ideas, and please, please don't make any rash decisions.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
