Summer project

When summer break comes along, students tend to forget stuff of what they have learned through the year. Noting this, if student would create their own project they might not do it very well because they wouldn't know how they would start it or if they are doing it right. On the other hand, when teachers give advice and instructions to the students, they do better then trying to figure out stuff by themselves. Even though we probably know what we are doing it is better to know that you are on the right path. Sometimes we students just need a bit of a push to start us up.

Teachers may affect a students way of being able to see things differently. For example, we learn more things when they are being taught to us rather then us trying to figure out ourselves. Having someone there for us helps us get farther since we have more support. When teachers design a school project, students know step by step on how to do things when the instructions that are given. We also know more things of how to do it the right way. Students can be great at designing things, but teachers can help us more since they know what we will need throughout our future and what it will hold for us.

In order for teachers to be able to teach, they have to go through school themselves. In this case, teachers know what is important for us and what will help us go farther in our future. When teachers design their own project they can check if students are doing it right by making them present them. When students present their project the teacher can tell if they did something wrong and can help them fix it right away, but when students do their own projects it would be harder for them to understand what part they messed up and how would they be able to fix it. Work gets more easier when you know what you are doing.

I would be able to understand on why people would think student select is better than teacher select because students would be able to express the things they know and remember. By dong this, students can show on what they have learned from what the teachers have taught throughout the school year. This is a good thing but it is better to be safe then sorry and be sure that we all are on the right track. Another reason might be that students would be able to get creative with their projects and i agree with that, but what would be the point of them being creative and doing it absolutely wrong. When you do a project that you made yourself you won't stay on topic for some time because the information being placed would be about anything.

teachers do a lot for us and help us get into the right path for our careers but they also want us to know the important things we will need in are lives. They want us to be successful and help us understand things that we might need later on in our lives. They will be their with us every step of the way to show us and let us understand on how to do things right and help us understand things so it can be more clear. By doing this, they give us instructions on how to do better so this is why my opinion is 'teacher select project' is better and has more advantage of 'student select project'.
