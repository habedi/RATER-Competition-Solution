Dear Principal,

I think that the students should engage more in the community service , because it could benefit the community and themselves. If students engage in any kind of community service, it it should be picking up litter around Bakersfield, because we have alot of trash lying around, polluting the planet. We could also probably help in the pet pounds to care for the dogs and cats there, because i know many students like dogs and cats. It would also be a good idea that the kids in detention should pick up trash in school. But also when the kids pick up trash there should be limitations on what they can do. Or maybe we could cook for the homeless shelter, we could learn little bit of homec or home skills, by learning how to cook. I think another fun good idea is planting trees around, especially in the parks.

We could probably perform community service when it's nearing the end of the quarter, but if we were to perform community service, it should not interfere with our homework , and school. Maybe there can be a way to combine community service with school, so that they don't affect our grades or what not.

Thank You,
