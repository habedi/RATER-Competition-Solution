Yes this would be a great tool for the classroom. Because what if somebody is actually down but they are fake smiling? Students could be fake smiling and actually be derpressed and we won't know it. What if there is something wrong with the student. We could ask or help out the student and hopefully help them out. We do not know how the other student feels we can not tell if something is wrong if we just look at them. In the passage it says " For instancem you can probably tell how friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried ect." This technology that we had come upon can calculate every muscle in your face. 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. The tool can tell if your not smiling enough or what expression you have on your face.
