The author idea is is it worthy to be studying Venus without putting people in danger.

I tink its worthy because if Earth can't be a place where humans can live they have to another planet where people can lve at.

Venus is called the twin of Earth because its close to Earth in terms and density. Many spacecrafts was sent to Venus but none of the spacecraft have survived more than a few hours. More than three decades no spaceship have touched Venus again . Venus is one of the plaents that is hard to study because of its tempurtures and reputation. Venus atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide. The clouds in Venus are more challenging because the have highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

Also the temperatures average are over 800 degrees Fahrenhiet and the atmospheric perssure is 90 times greater than Earth. The conditions of Venus are more extreme than Earth. For example the environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Venus has the hotter temperatures in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun. even though high pressures and heat the weather present addtional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most like Earth planet in our solar system.

Thats all what i got right now i wish i get a lot of points becuase of this.
