Dear Principal,

I think that children doing community service is a good way of helping people with what they need help in. But in my opinion, some kids should have the decision of choosing weather or not they want to be involved with the community service or not. The should have the right to choose because some kids really have things to do after school for example like helping your mother cook or you have to do some clean up in your house or even getting some tutoring in school. I think its still a good thing to go clean up in your community to make it a better place to live and to be clean and not nasty and uncomfortable.

Some kids in the world would want to help do community service but they might not have time to do. Some kids are right in saying that it might be a waste of time but your wasting your time to help people who are in need of getting help. So if the kids doesn't have time, doing force them in to doing community service because your just going to make them lose time that they have to do something else that is important to them too.

I would say that some kids don't like to do community service because they might think its not cool to be helping and also because they think their friends are going to make fun of them for helping out in school. I would say i am like that sometimes because I wouldn't want to do community service and having people laughing at me for doing something i care about doing. Just ignore people who are making fun of you and just enjoy what your doing to help the world and your community and you will be a good helper in your community. You never know who might be proud of you in your community.

In my conclusion, I think that kids should definitely have the choice of doing community service because its nothing bad your just helping out in your community and it really isn't a bad thing to do. But in the other hand some kids really don't have the time to do all the work that is required for community service. They might need to do something at home like clean or cook and also some kids would want to get some tutoring in school so that would prove that some kids really don't have time to work.
