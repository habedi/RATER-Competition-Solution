Dear Principle,

I understand that your thinking about reconsidering our school's cell phone policy which i hope will be more understanding. I am hoping you will think about placing a change in it which could be that we can use our cell phones during lunch, and other free times but have it turned off during class time. Which will lower the problems with us being caught using your cell phone during class. We know that we don't have the freedom to use our cell phones during class which is why we use them sneakily. It could be helpful to us to we could use the calculators on our phones or text our parents to pick us up or drop something off without needing to leave the classroom. It could be a great way to communicate with your teachers also you can call them asking them for what's due next period. The school can also give us more severe punishments also because they know they give us time to use our phones yet we still don't appreciate it. I forget my homework and sports uniforms a lot at home so during my free time i could call my mom and ask her

"Mom can you bring me my homework i left it in my room?" Also it makes us less stressed out if we can text our friends if anything wrong is going on.

What if we get left behind by accident on a school field trip? Then all we have to do is call the bus attendant and say come back and pick me up you left me here. If we participate in sports and we do not want to go on the game bus we can call our coaches and say my dads going to drop me off at the game

I'll see you there. All there is to it is that cell phones have some great things about them and some downfalls to them.
