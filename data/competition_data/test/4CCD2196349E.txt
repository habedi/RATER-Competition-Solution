"Hey Gary, did you read the draft of "Unmasking the Face on Mars" that NASA sent us?" I asked my friend who I work with in editing NASA's articles. "Yes I centainly did! And I think that the Face on Mars is clearly an alien artifact." he replied. "What makes you say that? There's not much evidence to prove that theory and I did not expect that from you Gary, you're such a logical person! Cleary you should think an alien made artifact is not logicly science! Right?" I asked. "Well... what do you think?" Gary asked daringly. "Sure, let me try to change your mind!" I shot back.

"The first picture of the Face was taken in 1976 when cameras and technologys were not that advanced yet. And the article says that a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." The article states that it was formed by shadows which gave the illusion of the face.

But people began to think that it was an alien sculpture. So on 1998, NASA

sent MGS to the Red Planet to take a better shot of the Face, the picture revealed a natural landform of Mars. But people like you, Gary, weren't convinced because it was winter where the Face was located so the alean markings were hidden.

Then in April 8, 2001, MGS flew to Mars on a cloudless day to get a better look at the Face. The camera the team used was a high reselution camerica, each picture spaned 1.56 meters. So if there were any alien like artifacts, it would have appeared in the picture. But it actually showed landforms that were common around western America."

"So what do you think now?" I asked after my speech. "Hmmmm, maybe you're right for once. You've stated your prespective reasonably. I never expected such a logical and scientific answer from you" He said. "Well thank you." I replied. "No, thank you." He said. "Because of your explenation, I will think of other interesting facts differently."
