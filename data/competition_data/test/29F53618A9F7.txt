Dear Principal,

I think we should make it required that all students perform community service. Some people may think that it takes too much time, but i don't think so. Yes, it does take time away from things you want to do, but helping people in need is probably the best way out.

Taking part in community service helps people in need or helps the community in general. For example, we could help clean up litter on our school grounds to make our school look amazing and make it better for the environment. The school could tutor the elementary kids with math and reading.

Community service is a awesome way to show that you care about your surroundings. We can show that we care by planting flowers in front of the school, picking up trash, recycling, and many more. If we all work together and try to make an effort then we can do community service all the time.

Making community service required sounds like a good idea to me. It could help people, the environment, maybe even the world. People aren't even trying to do it today. Making it required could help that. It could push people into helping others. Eventually we could not make it required and it wouldn't be a problem, they would see that community service is fun and it makes you feel good inside.

I hope you see that we need to make it required.

Thank you,

One of Your Students
