Dear Principal of Generic_School,

Recently, you have stated that you will be enforcing a radical and possibly illegal new policy. This new policy will force every student to attend and participate in extracurricular activities. I would urge you to reconsider, here are a few reasons why.

Many of our students that attend this school work jobs. You realistically cannot expect highÂ school students to quit their jobs and stop making income. Especially when that income goes toward paying for college, helping their parents make rent, and supporting their families. Jobs help shape and mold young people, as it is a vital experience that makes them ready for an occupation. However, if you do choose to enforce this policy, many local businesses will suffer from unemployment.

Another reason I am against this policy is that you are forcing students to do something that isn't required. After school programs are a great thing to students who are interested, but not to those who aren't. When you make someone do something against their will, the cons out weigh the pros. Those who aren't willing to learn, won't. As someone who has worked in the public school system, you must know this. You could make the argument that it's practically an extension of school, but it isn't. You cannot legally make students stay after 3:15, nor can you make teachers stay after 3:45. If you enforce this policy, it will only be a matter of time until upset parents will press charges against the school for illegally obtaining children.

The biggest reason why this policy would not be viable, is our budget. As many of us students know, our school system is not in a safe financial state. We are already on a tight budget, and expanding our extracurricular programs to serve around 400 more people doesn't make sense. Especially now, when we are spending thousands of dollars to prepare for a global pandemic that has already brought many schools around us to their knees. It is clearly not the time to waste our money on something we would possibly get sued for enforcing, instead of spending it on something we need.

This letter contains just a few reasons why I am against it. From unemployment to the legality, I hope I have changed your mind on this subject. And if not, I would surely wish you would be open to compromise.

With concern,
