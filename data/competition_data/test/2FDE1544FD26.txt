The principle has a lot of choices to make in a day. If she does decide to higher the grade requirement then more of the athletic kids will try harder in school.

The principle may have many choices to make in a day although sports should not be one of them. She could take away all of the sports if she wanted to. If she decides to higher the grade requirement then it would be one less worry on her mind.

So she can focus on the students getting better grades in the school. She will have less punishment to worry about that goes on in the classrooms. The students would have to work harder to get what they want and they would try harder in the sport activity.

The principle can also be more strict with the rules of the sports she can make it to where if you get suspended then you can not play for the rest of the season. She can make it to where if you give your teachers a hard time you can not play the sports. If the students are causing to much trouble in the classrooms then she can take away the sports all together.

She may have the power to take away the sports but if she does that then the grades in the school may drop. If she does decide to take away the sports then the kids that were trying hard to keep a good grade for the sports then they would stop trying so hard to keep them. If she just was to higher the grade then the kids that were already getting the good grades would be able to play without feeling left out of the team.

The principle has a lot of worries in a day the worry about kids joining sports should not be one of them. All in all if she were to higher the grades then only good things would happen to the school. She should higher the grades so the school in general will improve.
