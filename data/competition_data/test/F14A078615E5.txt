dear principal;

I think we should all do community service because it helps kids stay out of trouble. It also allows us to meet new people and make new friends. Some kids think community service is boring or tiring but it can be fun and if they see the fun in it they would look forward to coming to school every day. Every day when some kids get out of school they end up doing things they shouldn't and get in trouble for it too.

When kids do community service and they like it they continue to do it even knowing that they don't have to. Community service changes a lot of kids and they would then stop doing what's wrong and do what's right. Like for example this one kid who would never help people had to do community service. A few weeks of it changed him he started to help people and he made new friends from community service.
