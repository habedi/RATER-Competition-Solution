I disagree with that decision because, not all students may want to do an extracurricular activity. Some students have a lot on their plates already. To make it mandatory for students to participate in an extracurricular is inhumane.Â Students have the right to decide whether or not to join an extracurricular or not. Some students don't do one because they don't have the money to pay for the equipment to do some of the extracurricular activities offered.

Another reason I disagree is because, students might not have the time to do an extracurricular such as, sports or music. Students might have tons of homework they have to do everyday. Not to mention all the papers and other assignments that need to be turned in on time.

The third reason is students have enough to stress about without having to worry whether they had an upcoming basketball game. Students have to study for tests without getting distracted by other things. They already have to stress about the big end of year tests so, giving them something else to stress about might not be good for their health. It isn't all just about stress but it's also about health in general. If people overwork themselves they are going to become sick and if they are sick without knowing they are sick, it could also spread to others. This happend to me where I was overworking myself and right before winter break I got really sick. I have ways to relieve stress but some people might not. Therefore, schools shouldn't overwork their students.

I do agree that it would be a good way to get people interested in something but making it mandatory for people to something they don't want to be doing or they don't have the time is just so wrong on so many levels. I do three extracurricular activities, chorus, orchestra, and karate. All of those activities require me to exert a lot of energy and I put a lot of time and money into being the best that I can be in all of those activities. People who neither have the time nor the money could never be as successful as the people who actually have the time to practice and who have the money to buy new equipment whenever it breaks or is damaged.

In conclusion, I think that students should not be required to participate in extracurricular activities because they are being put under so much pressure already its not fair to force them into doing something that they might not want to participate in. Most people that don't do an extracurricular already have some reason for not joining one already. It might be because they don't have the time, or because they have to take care of their younger sibling because their parents work late. People never know what someone else is going through and people might not have any idea what can help them or what can hurt them. I think that the school has to think about the lives of all the students going there and not just some of them.
