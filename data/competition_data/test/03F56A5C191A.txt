Dear Principle,

I am writing to say that I agree with your changing this policy because this will want to make the students at our school work harder. Knowing that most of the kids at our school love sports or other school activities, it will make them want to do there homework or read there books. Now just imagine that all of our students in the school had a B average. We would be a recognized school. I do know that not all the students are the same. Some might not want to do there work and others will. But those few that won't do there work can receive help.

So i' m suggesting that you do change the policy. It might anger some parents but you can tell them that its for there child's good. I hope the parents can agree with your doing and not move there children to different schools. I also hope that other students follow in my tracks and agree with you to change the policy because it will change this school forever in many ways.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
