Fellow citizens of mine I have life changing news for you. The advantages of limiting car usage. What can possibly be good about that you ask? By limiting your car usage you will be saving the Earths atmosphere. Cars today emit alot of Carbonmonoxide into the air causing smog in some extreme ways. Paris, France is a great example of how bad cars can be when it comes to harming the atmosphere. The smog in Paris was so bad that the had to ban peple with even number licence plates that day, then odd the next day. The smog that was created by cars in Paris was rivialing Chinas capital city Beijing, also know as the worlds most poluted place. The weather made the smog worse in France but was eventualy lifted after a wile. After that the ban on the Cars was lifted.

This however could of been avoided if they limited the use on cars in their country. So knowing this, will you limit yourself?
