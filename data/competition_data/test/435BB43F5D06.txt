I am for the value of using this technology to read people emotional expressions. A few reasons I am for this experiment is because you can see how people feelings are, if a person has a hard time showing/ expressing their emotions to others, and see how others feel about you or another person.

This experiment can contructn a 3D facial model on a computer and pop right out and see how that person is feeling. The computer can classifiy the six basic expressions on a person, such as happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. Scienctist did a lab experiment on the famous Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona Lisa. The experiment was to see if Mona was trying to smile or if she was being serious, so they experimented to see her expressions.

The technology associates with facial movements and mussles, that the computer can detected a false smile and a netural expression. The technology of the computer can detect if a person has a real smile or a forced smile on their face. A way to see if a person is forcing their smile is by looking at the sides of their mouth because the smile is stretched on the sides of your mouth using a different mussle, the risorius.

The theory of the experiment is not only tp show and figure out you expressions/ emotions but it can also help you with producing them. The whole story is talking about showing the emotions of your peers.
