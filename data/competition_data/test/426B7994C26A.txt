What can get the best of the students to complete a school project during the summer. It is between teacher-design or student-design. Student-design would be best for the students. In the summer, the students have the time they need for what the need to do on the project. The students need to know how to find a way to do a project on their own. Students have their own way in learning, which is the reason why student-design is best for students.

The summer is the best time for a project, especially student-design. Students need their own time to figure out what they need to do to for the project. Some students already know what the can do but, other students have hard time finding their own way or doing the project. The time they need to complete everything is the whole summer and, there isn't school in the summer, excluding summer school. student-design gives students the time to really put what they've learn in the summer

Students-design allows students to open their mind and find a way how they want to do the project. people learn things as they do something. It can apply to here as well, students can learn what they are doing and use their learning to see how things are able to do what they do. Same with finding what type of project in the Student-design, students can evaluate their own life and anything can pop in your head to find a design or anything else. Life isn't easy but, student-design make students decide on their own how they are going to do the project.

Once again, all students are different in everything, even if its similar, its still not the exact same. What i am saying is students can surprise people if doing student-design because who knows what they find out the can possibly help them i the future. Yeah teacher-design can help the students a little more but, creativity and learning the way yourself is a great accomplishment and can possibly help in the next project you do after th summer. people that become successful are the ones who believe in their own work and the students should use their own work for not only for school, but for the anything in life.

Student-design for the students would best help the students be more wise on any work. the creativity can best help out in not only in school, but anywhere they go just because of one project. This project can help tell what students need to work on for the next school year that comes around. The student-design help know who is where and what is needed for after they finish school.
