The residents of Vauban, Germany have given up their cars to live in a car free enviroment. Some of the residents believe that this enviroment makes them happier. The reason behind this is because we are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that come from tailpipes. This experiment has the potential to become the most advanced experiment in low-car surburban life.

There are many places in the world that are trying this new experiment out. In the United Statesnthe Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting communities to become less dependent on cars. The legislators are starting to act on the bill and experts even expect public transpotation to play a larger role in society.

Also, in Paris, France there were days of near-record pollution. This is another reason for the experiments, to slow down the amount of pollution. Paris enforced a driving ban to slow down the pollution. The ban worked out so good that they even followed up on it afterwards.
