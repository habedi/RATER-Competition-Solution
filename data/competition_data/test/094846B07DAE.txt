Why We Should Not Allow Driverless Cars

Automated Vehicles have been around for quite a while now, many people have grown very fond of them, actually. With all of the new advances in technology today, many new upgraded cars are being released. But are driverless cars really a good idea? Considering the malfunctions, technical difficulties, and the laws on driving.

People all over the world use cars everyday as an easy way of transportation. There are many laws and safety regulations to follow when driving, as every driver knows, but how would they fall in line with driverless cars? If nobody is technically driving the car, how can anyone be punished for accidents? This is something that needs to be further looked in to.

Furthermore, every new invention is going to have its flaws. Putting something as big as driving into technology's hands is quite a scary thing. One small mistake could result in a huge accident. Deaths are already a big problem when it comes to driving accidents. We should not make this a bigger problem than it already is.

Another thing, we all have that one friend who can just never seem to work any kind of technology right? What happens if that person gets put behind the wheel of a driverless car? Even with training or a handbook things could get confusing, that goes for anyone. This is a big piece of technology, nothing like a smartphone or a computer. Peoples lives could be in danger when exposed to a driverless car. Nobody wants that, do they?

Lastly, I know that having a car that drives itself sounds amazing and totally worth it, but is it really? How do we know this is not one of the biggest mistakes to ever be put on paper? There are so many deaths caused by vehicle accidents already, why would we take the chance of increasing those numbers? We should just eliminate this problem before it even begins.
