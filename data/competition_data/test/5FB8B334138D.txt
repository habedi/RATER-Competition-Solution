Dear Principal,

I believe that students should be required to participate in some community service. I support my idea of having students participate in community service with evidence from my life.

In my life i think that i have done over 100 hours of community service. First of all, I have been a helper and a actor in a play at my church for a week of the summer. This experience changed me and made me a better person.

If we had students participate in community service we may be able to change how some people live. We may be able to get them to change there ways and stay out of trouble. If we required ever student to have a said amount of community service hours than they would have something to do with their time so they could stay out of predicaments that they should have not be in, in the first place

Another example from my life is the time i spend being a teachers assistant at SCHOOL_NAME, a Japanese summer school program. I started this program when i was in the 2nd grade. Naturally when i was younger I had always wanted to be come a teachers assistant. This program takes 5 hours of my day, for three weeks, Monday through Friday. This has saved me from getting in a lot of trouble.

From the example in my life i clearly stated why we should require a certain amount of community service hours for our students. First, it can make the teens better people. Second, it can change the way people live and treat others. And finally, the teens will have a better chance of not getting in trouble because most of the day will be filled with extra activities.
