Dear Principal,

I have been thinking about cell phones and why we should have them at school. You should allow students to bring their phones to school and let us only use them during lunch and other free times and then make us turn them off during class time. This could get a little worry off our shoulders, just a little bit. But for now here are some reasons you should let us have cell phones at school.

The first reason is about having them out during free time. Having them out at free time and lunch gives us a little more freedom, I think. We can get what every we needed done with our phones at those times and not in class bothering you and the teachers. This will let us ask our friend something that is in another room easier because then we are not asking to go here or there, disturbing others. This was one reason why we should have phones out in school.

My next reason is getting worries off our shoulders. By getting thing off our shoulders is if we left something at home for example we can text or call our family to bring it to the school for us and that will help us get our things to the teacher in time. Another example is if we are not feeling good we can call someone to come get us also.

Principal please think things over if you can and consider changing the schools policy to this. Hope that you will change it to this policy and so will everyone else. Everyone in the school will thank you for what you did if u do consider. So thank you and have a nice day.

Sincerely,

Me
