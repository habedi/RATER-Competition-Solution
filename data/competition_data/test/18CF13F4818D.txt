Many students play a sport or are involved with an activity such as a club, student council, and even NJHS (National Junior Honors Society) as well as other in school or outside of school activities. Most students go home everyday and relax the whole time and don't feel the need to exercise or do anything. This can start to take affect on their health and mental well being or even cause them to not care about school as much as to say someone who plays a sport for their school and attends clubs after school. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular activity or multiple activities of their choice for the benefit of their health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about.

Playing a sport is a healthy and enjoyable thing to add to your life. Sports help increase your endurance, muscle tone, overall health, and even helps you lose weight. Students who play sports tend to be less tired during the day and are much healthier than say a student who stays inside all day and doesn't play outside with friends or plays a sport. By adding a sport to your life, it gives you plenty of exercise and workouts each day and allows you to keep in shape and stay healthy.

When school is over, many students only think about how they're going to relax that day or what they're going to eat as soon as they get home. Most students don't really have much to do the rest of their day and often get bored most days after school. By doing an extracurricular activity such as a sport or club, it allows you to eliminate that boredom and have something to do either everyday or at least a few times a week. You can have something to look forward to everyday at least and can do something you love instead of sitting on the couch waiting for tomorrow to come. It's best to choose an activity you really like, by doing something you love, it makes it both enjoyable and makes you feel less stressful since it's an activity you really like and enjoy.

Some students find school very challenging or have mental disabilities that prevent them from easily completing school and gives them challenges they have to figure out how to overcome. School clubs such as homework clubs or even clubs that are dedicated to a specific subject or idea can help a student really understand the content they're learning about and help make it easier to focus in class and not struggle as much. Clubs that are dedicated to certain ideas or subjects often learn more about that subject or idea because of the fact that it mainly focuses on specific content or a wide range of data related to a certain genre. By joining a club, you immediately learn more than you would in a class because it's a more open learning environment and different people share their knowledge instead of maybe 1 teacher.

I do agree that our principal should make all students participate in an extracurricular activity because of the benefits for your health and mental well being, to give them something extra to do after school or even an activity they love, and to help some students that are struggling and need the support or can help widen and better understand certain subjects they like to study and learn about. Everyone should find an activity they love to do and add it to their life to benefit them even if it's multiple activities.
