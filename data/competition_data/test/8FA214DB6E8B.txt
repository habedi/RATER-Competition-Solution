What's even more boring than school? Homework? Afterschool activities? Well yes, Afterschool activities are super boring and they shouldn't have them for schools. People think that first doing school is boring enough, but doing afterschool activities is probably the WORST idea ever because you have to do even more work. I believe that we shouldn't have afterschool activities because it makes things even worse than usual.

One reason why schools shouldn't have afterschool activities, is because it's is extremely exhausting. As I was walking out to do bus duty, I heard a student say, "I have practice tonight, but I'm super tired and I want to lay down and take a nap", says Generic_Name, 8th Grade Dean of Generic_school.

A second reason why schools shouldn't have afterschool activities is because it's a waste of time. Students have reported that they have a big MASTERY test the next day and they have to go to practice so they don't have much time to be able to study for the test the next day.

Some people argue that doing afterschool activities are actually really fun, because "You can hang out with friends and not have to do homework right away", says Generic_school of the Institute of National Athletics and Sports. However, doing afterschool activities is really annoying because "people that are really tired and don't want to go to practice or their sport, and want to go lay down and take a nap on their bed", says researcher Ethan Adams of the Institute of afterschool programs.

I believe that all schools shouldn't have afterschool activities because it's extremely exhausting, and it's a waste of time. I would think twice about signing up for afterschool activities because you might want to change your mind and then not do it.
