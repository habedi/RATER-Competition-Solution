You can help people that have these problems by bringing them food, water, building materials, and other items that they need for daily living. Helping someone always feels fantastic beause you know that you did the right thing.

Being over sea for so long with other people would mean that you would most likely end up being friends. With everybody being friends you would be able to have so much fun. Being over sea with a bunch of friends means that you would be really entertained. This would be enteraining because you could keep yourselves entertained by playing table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games. All of these would pass time. Also, if you have never been on a boat before then you would be able to experience something new! You could argue that being oversea would be to dangerous but here's why your wrong, you would be on a boat that always has someone watching for danger so you would be safe.
