Phones at School

I know a lot of people that text in class.

Most of them text during lunch. During lunch there are a greater amount of kids to gather.

Then you would think there's more supervision.

well if you are think that your wrong. There less supervision during lunch.

To most kids that are going to text at school they do during lunch when it makes more seen.

There should have texting during lunch if there going to be texting at school because at that time at school we are not learning anything which gives us time to text.

I think texting during lunch should be allowed.

There is all ready a large amount of people that texting during lunch anyways.

It will help the teachers out to because they wont have to be on the watch for people using phones and have to turn them into the office.

If there is texting at the school then if someone for gets a permission slip or something they can easily text there mom and bring it to them.

That will be easier than have to send someone to the office to call there mom.

Students will like going to school more.

They will enjoy lunch more.

It make students look forward to lunch which will make them try harder during class so they can get ready for lunch.

For the first week that the students are allowed to have phones they will go crazy and use them all the time.

After a couple of days they will calm down and start to use them less and less.

This will help the students and the teachers.

The teachers will not have to worry about as much texting in there classes.

That are some of the reason texting should be allowed in lunch. It will help the students and the teachers.

Over all i think it would be good for the schools.

That's why texting should be in the schools.
