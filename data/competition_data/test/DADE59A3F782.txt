Dear Principal,

I believe that you should not require all students to perform some act of community service. I believe it is a choice rather to perform some act of community service or not. Someone should not be made to do what they wish to not. If students would like to have community service they than they can do that on their own time.

For example I do community service with my church. I had a friend along with me who had never been to church. I asked her if she would like to help me in the soup kitchen that Sunday afternoon. She just said that she was not in to community service and would rather go home, but said that she thought it was great that I was helping in the soup kitchen.

Another example was when my brother had some friends over from school. One of them had to leave so he could go help his mom clean up some elderly peoples homes. He asked my brother and the other friends if they would like to come. My brother replied and said "sure that'd be fun" but the other friends didn't want to so they just stayed at home until my brother was back.

With those people asking if others would like to help with community service it gave the others a chance to decide for themselves. I believe that people should not be forced to do something they wish not to do.

Therefore I hope that you do not require all students to perform some act of community service. For the students that would like to perform some act of community service there could be a group set up or every Wednesday they could go pick trash up off the highway, so that it is a way for people to make their own decisions on rather or not they would like to perform community service.
