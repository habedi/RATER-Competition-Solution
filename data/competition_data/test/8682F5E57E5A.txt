Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a way of giving back to your community. It's hard work, but it also can be quite interesting and fun! The students don't know what they are missing out on! Which is why you should require students to do community service hours. Some students say it's boring or it takes up too much time. Most of the students who say that haven't even done community service before. How do you know if you will like something if you haven't tried it ever before? There are many options to choose from to get the hours needed. Students can pick fun things to do, and end up helping out in the community. Some students can even make long lasting friendships with the people they help or the people who are working with them! It is a win for everyone!

As I said before, how do you know if you like something or not when you haven't ever tried it before? The answer is you don't know. So students who say community service work is too hard or boring have no right to say that. Most of those students haven't even done community service, and those who did didn't pick something that they wanted to do. They had the wrong mental attitude. If you go in to this thinking, "I just got to get this over with," you are set on the track of having one long and boring day. Trust me. Community service can be very fun; all it takes is a positives attitude.

Choosing the right thing to do for your community service hours is a key ingredient to enjoying community service. You have to do something that you like in order to fully enjoy your time. Students don't understand that there are many other options than cleaning up trash on the high-way and volunteering at "old folks" homes. I do community service at my church by helping out in the nursery, and volunteering for

Vacation Bible School. VBS for short. I get to work with kids, which I absolutely love to do, and I'm helping out my church community also! You should try to make it clear to students that they can choose fun things to do for their community service.

The best part of community service is making long lasting friendships with the people around me. The children I sung and danced with at VBS are now some of the children I babysit for. I met a bunch of girls my age there who are now some of my closest friends. And it was all because I helped out at VBS. I know a bunch of people in my school who love making new friends! This would be a great opportunity for them!

In conclusion, community service is fun! You get to help out your community. You can do something you love to do. You can discover a new passion. And most importantly, you can make new friends! That is why you should make it a requirement for us to do community service hours. I hope you consider my opinion. Thank you!

Sincerely,
