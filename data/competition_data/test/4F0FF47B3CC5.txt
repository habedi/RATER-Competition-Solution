Students have projects throughout the whole school year to expand their learning. All of the projects are usually teacher-designed and students are given requirements of what needs to be in their project. A lot of schools have summer projects to keep students engaged in learning over their break. Since teachers design all of the in-school projects, students should design their summer projects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it lets students be more creative, have more freedom, and prepare them for the future.

Students should design their summer projects because it lets them be more creative. Having students be more creative makes it more of a fun time to be learning. They will research things that interests them and they will want to put in the work. They will actually get excited about some of the school work their doing. Summer is a time to have fun and rest. Having to do work assigned by teachers will make students lazy. If students design their projects, they can do research on things they've done during their break also. If something they've done or somewhere they went is what they want to do for there project, then they should be able to be creative and do it. If students are allowed to be more creative, they will almost make it a competition and want to make it better than others. It will make them thing outside the box to come up with something no one else will do. Also, doing a different type of project makes it more challenging which makes them be more creative. If they do a project on something they enjoy, then they will become more creative.

Second, students should design their summer projects because they will have more freedom. Having more freedom motivates students to do their work. If they are more motivated to do it, it will come out better and students will feel better about the work they did. Like said about being creative, if students have more freedom, they will research on something they enjoy and have fun doing it. They will want to do the work which would end up with a better final product. Many students, especially in the summer, will put things off thinking they have all the time in the world, and then it ends up being two days before school starts and they haven't started their project. If they don't have a list of things to do, they will feel like they have more work to do and create their own list of things and do their research, etc. When they know what they have to do, they will procrastinate. When they're kind of lost, they feel like they need to get it started.

Last, students should design their summer projects because they will become more prepared for the future. Students will have to work independently because everyone will be doing something different. They wouldn't be able to check in with other people or get the answers, they have to put all the work in themselves. Having no one guiding them prepares them for the future for when they will have to create your own projects all the time. It makes things more challenging and really makes them do all their research and perfect their projects. If they are being challenged, they will get better at doing their projects and make teacher-designed projects easier. They will become less dependent on their teacher and become more trusting in themselves because they can do things on their own. In the future, they won't always have someone to check with and guide them on what their supposed to do.

While teacher-designed projects keeps students on track and makes it easier for them, students creating their own projects prepares them for their future jobs and college projects, and givesÂ them more space to research things they enjoy and find more interesting which motivates them to do the work. If summer-projects are student designed, they will grow up to be more prepared, creative people.
