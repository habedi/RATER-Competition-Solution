Growing up as a person is not just about the things you learn in school. It is also about having fun and learning who you are. I believe that extracurricular activities are the best way to learn how to do these things. With extracurricular activities, you will enjoy your middle school life much more. They will create less stress, give you oppurtunities to meet new people, and will make you a better person.

It's hard to find people that you like in middle school. If you find a club, sport, or activity that you enjoy outside of school, you will meet other people that share that same interest. You will likely form bonds with these people and become friends. Having people that you can talk to and trust is very important, especially when you are in middle school. Being in a club or on a team teaches you to cooperate with others and be more social and outgoing.

It is a well known fact that school causes a lot of stress in adolescents. After school, going to your extracurricular activity can get your mind off of all the stress that goes on in school or while doing homework. Playing a sport actually releases chemicals in your brain that make you happier. Doing an activity can also make you better at time management. If you are participating in an ativity after school, you must have the responsibility to do your homework as soon as you get home and not get distracted. This will prepare you for when you're in high school and there is block scheduling. You can't procrastinate or you will never catch up.

Extracurricular activities teach you a lot, no matter what the activity is. Whether you are learning a new skill, or helping the environment, you are becoming a better person. Many schools offer activities or clubs that can get you involved in your school's community. You can volunteer at a local animal shelter, or learn an instrument and make beautiful music. Whatever you do, finding something that you are passionate about will have a positive effect on your life.

Although many middle schoolers enjoy sitting at home all afternoon, eating and watching television, they should experience different activities. You don't know if you are good at something or if you enjoy it if you haven't tried it. If you go out and try new things, you will see that there is a whole world outside of school and home, just waiting to be explored.
