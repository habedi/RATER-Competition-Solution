A computer shouldn't be able to tell peoples emotions. Having emotions is a very personal thing between you and only you or if you choose to share them with others. Thats what makes people so real and relatable to. A computer shouldn't be able to determine somes emtions or be creditiable enough to do that because its not a human a lot of malfuctions can happen. Your taking the realness out of the human and puting it into a computer.

Them wanting to use computers to show peoples emotions might make people feel very vulnrable. "Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression" (like not smiling as broadly).

Which is saying that they are calculating our different facial expressions. Also they shouldn't use math to calculate people feelings what if they calculate wrong? How do they know our emotions can even be calculated with numbers? We aren't calculators that you can just punch in numbers to figure us out.

That will be very hard no one should feel like there feelings are being told off to everyone. Its no ones business espicially a computers job to be telling your emotions that what makes you a human being. Not everyone wants to be like da Vinci painting Mona Lisa. Some people just want to be themselves. Without having to put their feelings on display. That should be there choice not some computer, doctors, or scientist choice.
