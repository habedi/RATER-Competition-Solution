NASA has always knowen it was a simple rock from the beggining. Listen im tired of hear all of this nonsense,and I am not the only one. All of the world allredy knows that it was a huge rock formation with human charatictics with shadows giving it eyes,an nose, and a mouth. It was just tooken at the right place at the right time. It was just another conspiracy theory waiting to erupt.

The only reason that NASA hasnt told the truth is because do now how much fame they are getting off of this right know. They knew it was a rock from the beggining. So even on April 5,1998 when they got caught red handed from a picture they took ten times sharper then the viking they kept the story going. They even went as far as saying that the aliens had errased it. LIke how far will they go with this thing. All of this because of a huge rock and a mistaken picture. So when people still wanted more and NASA did to they tried again hoping for a mirical. They still wanted more out of this rock. The only reason NASA didnt shut this down was because they need the fame and money. This picture ended up becoming a pop icon. It starred in a holloywood film,appeared in magizines,radio talk, and shows. Whey would they think of shuting it down. So they led people into thinking that this was some alien race marking. So when things were dying down they hoped for another miricle and sent anothe spaceship up into spacejust to show people it was just a rock again.

So out of this rock they ended up getting a couple years of fame and a very large fan base. To this day Nasa keeps the roomer going around. I think this picture was just and accident that turned into a trophie for NASA.They made sure to make the most of it but knew they couldnt hold it for long. They knew it was a perfect story to spark a conversation between thousands of people so theybrought it out just to do that. NASA used it for they're copminy but at the end it was just a rock,just like they found it.
