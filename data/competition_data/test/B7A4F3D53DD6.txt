Dear Principal,

I think you should require all students to perform community service because it helps the environment to stay clean. It decreases the risk of humans and animals from getting sick. Also, it helps students take responsibility of cleaning after themselves whereas people just litter and throw stuff on the floor. It harms animals because if you throw something like plastic on the floor and a cat comes and eats it, it can choke and die from the plastic you threw on the floor. I think it is a good idea to require students to perform community service.

The main reason why I suggest this is because students will take responsibility of cleaning after themselves. If some students do not want to perform community service they should at least clean up after themselves and recycle things like cans that they finish drinking. I highly advise that you make students perform community service because students will help the community and most importantly help themselves from littering and killing animals like birds or cats. Students should participate in this activity because it will improve the way they work outside of the house.

Another reason why I suggest community service is because it will not harm the environment. People shouldn't slack and throw objects on the floor because it doesn't look good and most important, it harms animals. If a tourist from a different residence comes to visit the city you live in and it is trashy he probably wouldn't want to stay there. Not just students should participate in community service but adults should too. Not all people litter and I thank the people that clean after other people, but all should clean up and pick up trash off of the floor even if it is not yours.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
