Reasons Why We Shouldn't Use This Technology!

The idea in which we can read human emotions is not an easy thing to do. The amount of time, technology, and effort is extraordinary. The fact that we achevied this goal in technology is outstanding! However to most this feat as great as it is could seem actually pointless with only some good things about it. I personally believe that its not something society really needs at this time.

Sure this technology advancement can be used in some situations. In fact one of the biggest things this could be used for is to basiclly replace the polygraph system. The Polygraph test could be obsolete compared to this technology.+ This technology breakthrough can be used by law enforcement to determine whether or not someone is telling the truth. This could make procicutions faster and even hopefully more efficent.

Humans instinctivly hide away from their emotions. They divert them by thinking of other things. But for one to hide their expression is not that simple however. To some this tecchnology could possibly come off as a breach of privicy. No matter how great this opurtunity could be.

The flaws that thing thing could have are quite emense if you think about it. To have something be able to read you like a book almost just by a facial expression must be difficult. The algorithms are extremely complex as stated in paragraph 7. One simple misread of this algorithim could sevearly change the outcome.

This technology could truly be revolutionary for man kind. However this may only truly have one use. And that is to replace the Polygraph Test. Otherwise there may truly be no use for it besides for curiosity. That is why I stand against this technology. That as well as it could possibly be a breach of privicy. This technology could invade simeones personal life. That is truly the main reason I disagree with this.
