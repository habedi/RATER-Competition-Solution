Venus is a dangerous beecause almost 97% of carbon dixoxide is covering the whole planet, the skies are highly corrosive in sulfuric acid. Humans have no chance to even stepping one foot on venus. The risk is very high that you will not survive. Humans and other space crafts will not last long on venus, The enviroment is not like earth. Scientist are concidering to visit Venus as an mission to explore the craters, mountains, valleys and other features Venus has to store. NASA is thinking about sending humans to study Venus. That would be survivable but the conditions wont be easy. Also, The tempature at or around Venus will be around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Nasa is working on having mechanical computers sent to Venus so they can study the surface and other things that come along. Scientist will need that computer to have all the safety features needed so they can get all the evidence needed for an explanation or answer, without the computer being destroyed by Venus's environment.
