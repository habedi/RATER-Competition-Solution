In this artical, Driverless cars are coming, tells us about the technological development that we are able to come up with today. My standpoint on the driverless cars is that I am against them. Not only are they dangerous, but they can also be deadly. they can easly crash, they can put people out of jobs, and they would also take a lot of money to build firstly, the driverless cars can easly crash. If the driver is not paying attention, the car would not be able to navigate by itself, therefore causing a possible accident. The driverless car is still technically not a driverless car, it still needs human help, like backing out of driveways, navigating in difficult traffic construction, and also navigating through roadwork. if the driver is not alert, then the cr would not be able to turn itself.

secondly, they would put millions of taxy driver and other people out of work. if the problems are worked out of the car, them they will soon be on the road. the taxi services and other car makers will soon be out of work because then would the people of the usa want to drive themselfs around when they could just sit back and relax while the car does all the work.

thirdly, they will be a lot of money to build. Just to build one of them would cost millions and millions of dollers. this would then put the economy at risk because it is being taken out of state taxes. this would cause the government to start taxing everything to help get the taxes back up. with all of the sensors and technology put into the driverless car, nobody would be able to buy it, maybe millionairs.

in conclusion, the driverless car seens to be a good ides, but thinking about it now, with all the new styled technology bring put into it, you just have to weigh the risks and the good things involved with owning it. its a great idea, but it still seems to have some gliches.
