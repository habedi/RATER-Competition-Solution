Dear principal

I have heard that you may want to change the policy for cell phone use during school hours. I believe that kids, as well as adults, should be able to use cell phones.

Here's my reason: we all may receive texts or calls during the day that may be important.

Such as a family member or pet in serious danger or injured. Our car or house being robbed and damaged.

Also, the students may have homework or late work they may need to catch up on, they could use there cell phones as calculators or online dictionary. You may not believe that there are educational tools on our phones, so let us prove to you that we just don't text on our phones.

I know you are a woman of high character ,and may not give this much thought, but please give this a consideration. My vote is for policy 1. Thank you

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
