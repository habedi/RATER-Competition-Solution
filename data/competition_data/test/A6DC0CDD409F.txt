Teachers, have you ever wondered what your students are thinking when you're teaching them something confusing? Well, with this new technology, you can at least know their emotions. In my essay I will be providing proof of how using this new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

The use of this software could be helpful in a classroom because it could help the teachers know when their students are confused about something they're teaching so they could improve the way they teach. In the text, Dr. Huang predicts that, "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" (pargraph 6). The text also states that, "then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" (paragraph 6). These quotes show how this new software could help an instructor/teacher know when their students are confused or bored and how knowing this information could make them a better teacher.

Secondly, this new technology could be helpful because it could strengthen the relationship between student and teacher without any words being spoken. In the text it says, "most human communciation is nonverbal, including emotional communication" (paragraph 6). The text also states that "they even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one" (paragraph 7). These quotes show how this software could help a teacher better understand their students emotions when their giving a fake smile maybe around a bully or harasser even when there are no words being spoken between them.

Lastly, the technology is valuable in a classroom because it identifies all different types of emotions and muscular movements so teachers understand their students feelings a lot better than they would without the software. In the article it states, "the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles" (paragraph 3). The article also states. "Eckman has classified six basic emotions- [programmed into the software] happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles" (paragraph 3). These quotes show how different types of muscles in your face are used in this software to identify emotions to create a better understanding of students feelings about their peers, work, or teachers.

To conclude, this software could be very valuable at a school where children are being bullied because some students are afraid to say they are going to school in fear, or even at a regular school where some students are confused about their school work and don't want to speak up. If you are an administrator reading this, think about all of the reasons why I believe that this technology could be useful in a classroom and then think about all of the students in your school who could either be too afraid to speak up about being bullied, or that are too afraid to ask their teachers for help and will never know how to do something until they finally gather up enough courage to ask. These things are actual problems that need to be addressed and there's finally something that can identify emotions and feelings about these types of problems.
