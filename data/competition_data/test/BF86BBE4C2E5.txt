Some schools offer distance as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, but not all of the students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. however, there are a lot of students that have disabilities and are not able to do something as other students do.( for example) Many students are able to run faster than others, but these students with these problems have a lot of disadvantage. Also students that take classes from home, have the opportunity to revised any assignment at any time they want until they understand the concept of it. By taking classes online students also have the enough quantity of time to planned and prepare any task that they are having issues with and at the end obtain better results.

A lot of students prefer to take classes online because some of them don't have the chance to attend to school on time, and some of the students preferÂ to drive instead of taking the school bus. Also these students that drive have the opportunity to stay after school every day and do any assignment that have missed instead of obtain a low percentage of the grade.

Those students that are sick and cannot attend school because of health, have the chance to do the work at home by taking classes online and not get behind.( example) students can get sick easily when they are waiting for bus, maybe when the rain comes and the students get wet and bad weather also. Many students attend school very late because they don't get enough sleep they need, however they are able to do it at home.

Students can do better stuff while they are at home because while they are at school and have any assignment that has to be with presentations people get shy sometimes and also don't do what they need to do, but if they do it at home evrytime they get better and better and not waste their time.
