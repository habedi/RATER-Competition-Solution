TEACHER_NAME,

I think that the students SHOULD perform community service because it would be helping out with our community. We should go around and start to pick up trash and through it away not because we HAVE to but because it would HELP OUR COMMUNITY! Besides if we don't pick up trash and garbage off the ground and out of the water than animals could die and it would most likely be OUR fault because we wouldn't have done nothing about it.

We could also do something to try and reduce the use of pollution by riding bikes roller blades and roller blades, and using skate boards and also many more things other than using cars all of the time and creating more pollution because our world does not need to be exposed to that particular substance. As long as the world is being taken care of please try and make anything that can help our community even more possible so that less animals can die and that more will survive. If there is anything you can do to make this world a better place then you can start by letting us help out this world. Lets go planet green!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
