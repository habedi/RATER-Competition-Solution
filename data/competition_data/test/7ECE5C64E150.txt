Since some schools require summer projects should they be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe that the projects should be student-designed because it can make them responsible, gives them a chance to prove they are hard-working, and chosing it on their own gives them more of a fun learning experience.

To start off, schools should allow the projects to be student-designed because it can make them responsible. Giving the student a chance of being responsible is a great way to help them in and out of school. Responsibility makes the student want to step up and prove they want to do good on their own. Teaching a student to be more responsible can get them far in life. In addition, if they are applying for a job or even if they are going to college showing that they are responsible is a good trait to have.

Another reason, to why students should be alowed to pick their projects is because it gives them a chance to be hard-working. To show that you are hard-working you have to be determained to get the job done. For example, I am a student that is determained to get her work done in order to keep good grades. Being hard-working shows that you have self-direction. You can't find many teenagers that have self-direction. If a student can choose their own project and get it done that proves that they are hard-working.

Finally, I can argue and say that teachers should pick the projects because they will challenge the students, teachers have more experience, and they would give the students a non-fun, but better learning experience. I agree, that the teacher would give the student more of a challenge , but what's the point if the student doesn't want to be challenged anyways. Teachers should give a fun learning experience not a boring one because it gives them a purpose into doing their work. This is why I believe that students should pick their own projects.

In conclusion, even though schools require summer projects they should let them be student-designed due to it making them responsible, gives them chance to prove that they are hard-working, and chosing their own project gives them a fun learning experience. Students should understand with the acception of them picking their own projects they shouldn't slack off because they are getting it easy because teachers aren't challenging the student and giving them a non-fun learning experience.
