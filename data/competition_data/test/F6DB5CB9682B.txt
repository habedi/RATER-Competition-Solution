I would probably agree with policy 2 because i don't think kids need their phones. Even if they can use them during lunch they will start to text during class and it would be a big problem. At our school our phones are supposed to be off and in our locker when we bring them. The thing is nobody listens to that rule. Me i don't even bother bringing my phone to school because with my luck someone will call me during class.

Like i have stated i believe kids should not be aloud to use their phones at all unless there is an emergency. This means kids can use them if there is a family emergency or any emergency.

People in my school will text during class and put their phones under the table and play games when the teachers not looking. They also will never get caught either. These are the reasons phones should not be used during school because students will take advantage of it.
