Driverless cars is certainly an amzing idea. It has captured the ideas of filmakers and writers around the world. It is a great idea and should be pursued. The reason for this is because it would make the roads safer, and give people more free time.

The reason this is a great idea is because a driverless car would make the roads much safer. There would be very little room for human error. If all cars were driverless operating under the same systm then they would always be doing the same things, meaning they would never crash into each other. With new technological advances in society, we would be able to create new sensors that could locate the objects around them and drive on the road. The article already list a few of the advances in sensors that can lead to very safe cars.

This would also give people much more free time. You can do things on the internet within your car that you would not have been able to do otherwise, considering the idea from the article about the heads-up displays. Also if you had a systme driving your car for you, you could travel at much higher speeds. The car would never leave the road because of a jerk of a hand. They would run, completely safe at higher rates of speed, giving people more time to do the things that they need.

These are just two of many reasons why we should have driverless cars around the world. It would be a huge step in society and technology. We need driverless cars to make the roads safer and to give people more free time.
