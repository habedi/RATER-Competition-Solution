I believe that the face is just a natural landform. I know this because people discovered or proven if or if not there is life on Mars. People always talk about martians, but never really find them.

Mars has peculiar weather conditions. They have dust storms. They dust gets whipped by wind. Mars also gets hit by meoters and rarely, astroids. An astroid hit Mars hard enough that a piece of it flew to the Earth. When Mars gets hit, it forms craters on the surface and can go deep into the ground. The wind could have possibly pushed dust into a crater and formed the face.

Also, NASA sends different space crafts and structure to take a look at Mars. Usually the crafts land on 3 or more legs. The craft could have possibly marked a dust mound. Wind three or more legs, you could form the face on Mars' surface.

What NASA needs to do is send more crafts and robots. I think they should do that to get mor eevidence then just taking some pictures. THe robots can do things that a human would. The robot can feel the face and dig to see what is under it. Yes, it would ruin the face but we would get evidence and details if we try.

In conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. We to strive to find evidence on why it is there and why it formed. Maybe there is Life on Mars. The world may never know.
