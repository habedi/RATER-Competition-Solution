Policy 1 is better for the students because some students like to have cell phones and to use them but during a free time like lunch, before or after school and some no. Cell phones can be use in school but not during classes because it disturbs the class if it rings or you can hear the sound of the phone clearly.

I think that the principals should let us use the cell phones during lunch periods and they should let us bring them to school but we should turn them off during class and turn them on after school or before school, before classes begin.

We could also leave the phones turn on in classes but with low volume or in vibrate mode if we have an emergency but not being using them when we are in class working and neither when we have a test.

If we are having a familiar emergency, then I think that when we get to school to leave the phones in silence or vibrate mode in case we need to receive a text message from some of our parents and just look at the text then put the cell phones away in our backpacks or in our pants.

As the students like to be texting and calling other friends and all of that with the cell phones, and they should do it after school, before school, in lunch period or during a free time or periods. The principals should let us bring them at school because some of the school are not permitting the students to have or bring cell phones to school but I don't know why if it's a natural thing that people like to have cell phones and specially teenagers.

I would suggest to all the principals to be agree with policy 1 and to follow what it says there, to let students bring cell phones to school and let them use them at lunch period or during a free time or period, and turn them off during class or put the in silence or vibrate mode before getting to class or to do a work.
