Have you ever been in a loud, tedious, and obnoxious environment? Have you ever lacked proper individual assistance? If so, you qualify to relate to thousands of students who attend public schools. It is no secret that public schools are not meant for everyone. Some students learn and develop under private school systems, meanwhile others learn and mature better through homeschooling. Nevertheless, every student is different, and each student requires proper individual care, so he or she can reach their full potential. If all schools provide online learning, there could possibly be a massive raise in most students grades, which could not only benefit the students but the schools as well. I believe students will tremendously benefit from the opportunity of online courses, as revealed through, the extensive individual assistance, opportunity for less distractions, and development of self growth and individualism.

First, many students are constantly frustrated about the lack of help they receive. Students fall behind in lessons and classes, because they are not sought after and given proper help. This frustrates many students and is revealed through their grades and assessment scores. A simple and easy solution to all this would be home school. Students can learn all the material thought in class, but in a manner where assistance is provided when needed. This allows students to go at their own pace, and ask for help at any time. Lavar Ball, a well known celebrity, enrolled his youngest son into a home schooling program. Lavar believes the transition was very simple and beneficial for his son. His son is now a professional basketball player, so this proves that home schooling can be a very open and helpful resource for students.

Next, as we know, many students have a difficult time focusing in certain environments. Many classrooms are loud and obnoxious which takes away from certain students abilities to learn. Students with ADHD, and other minor illnesses need controlled situations that allows them to cancel outside noise and simply learn. However, classroom settings do not promote or support that need, and instead promote group work and class engagement. As you can see, this is harmful to the learning of many students which then leads to a drop in grades and causes specific students to loose motivation in their classwork. When taking classes online, students are in a much calmer and reliable situation, which allows them to showcase their true abilities. Once again, I believe the simple solution would be allowing students to take online courses from home, so they can be free of distractions, get individual help, and mature on their own.

Finally, I believe students develop self growth and individualism through online courses from home. When taking classes online, students are essentially working at their own pace, as oppose to, a specific schedule set by somebody else. This then leads to students learning how to manage time and working on the clock. This is a very important skill that is required in the real world, so those who inherit home schooling will get a head start. Next, students can get proper sleep, and schedule there classes at later start times. Some High Schools begin at 7:15 AM, which does not give students proper sleep. The lack of sleep then plays an important role in the lack of focus and attention students provide in class. When taking online courses, students are able to start their classes at later times, and get the proper sleep necessary. This not only allows students to thrive in the classroom, but also plays a huge role in building a healthy lifestyle. Online courses also provide students with a great sense of individualism. Students grow and learn much more about themselves when given the opportunity to work alone and control their own education.

In Conclusion, I believe students can only benefit from the idea of being home schooled, as shown through, the extensive support, efficient learning environment, and fantastic opportunity for self growth. Students are sometimes scared or hesitant to seek the help needed, so online courses and home schooling may be the perfect solutions. The great aspect of online courses is that they are optional, revealing that it can help students in positive ways. Some of the most successful individuals in the world have dropped out of public schools, and embarked on a life of their own. Online courses are an amazing resource for students, and should be taken advantage of!
