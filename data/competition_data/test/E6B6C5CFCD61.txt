In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by presenting examples of how NASA is trying their best to find a way to survey Venus, as well as state how these examples could work, and why NASA is wanting to go to Venus at all.

In paragraph 4, the author states "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in out solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be out nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable[.]"

The author stating the reasons why NASA (as well as other astronomers) wants to go to Venus is exactly the answer to the question. The planet could have Earth-like minerals or even evidence of past life that may have lived there long ago. Going to Venus would be risky, but given the opportunity we should explore all the planets we can, just to see what it's like.

Like Christopher Columbus exploring new lands around the world, we should be pioneers in the context of space exploration. Seeking out new life, and to go where no man has gone before, for the sheer benefit of exploration.
