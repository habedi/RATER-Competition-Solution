Students can feel various different types of emotions throughout the school day. School can be very stressful and overwhelming yet so enjoyable at the same time. When students are feeling a certain way, it may affect their ablity to learn. By incorporating the use of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom, teachers or even the computers themsleves could alter the learning style of the information being taught, making it customized and fitting for a specific student based on their emotions.

Everyone is different when it comes to learning. Some students may be visual learners where as some students may be auditory learners. There are numerous, unique differences spanning from individual to indivdual which makes it hard on teachers when trying to teach a group of students the same material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System would make the job easier on teachers and prove helpful for students. For example, if a teacher could not visually recognize that one of thier students was tired, they may continue on with the way they are teaching the information, and that particular student may not grasp the concept being taught. With the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher would be able to recognize the students emotions and would have the opprotunity to alter her teaching method to somehting more engaging for the student. This would also prove helpful for the student that was feeling tired becasue they would now be able to become engaged with a modified style of learning.

If the Facial Action Coding System recognized that the students appeared to be happy and engaged, this could guide the teacher to continue teaching in that particular style and it would benefit the students trying to learn. Another way that this new technology could prove valuble in the classroom is if students were doing work on their computer or other elctronic device. If the Facial Action Coding System was installed into the learning devices that the students are using, the device itself could alter the learning style of the information given to fit the students needs. Even Dr. Haung, a professor at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicts that "A classroom computer could recognize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" (Huang).

The Facial Action Coding System would prove to be valube and helpful in many ways when incorporated in the classroom. The use of this technology would allow teachers and electronic teaching devices to enhance their learning styles to attend to all different types of students. Often times teachers forget that some individuals learn differently than others and only focus thier course in one direction. This new form of technology could serve as a reminder to teachers that students vary in learning styles but could also account for those differences among students.
