Having the ability to have a car that drives itself could save a lot of lives on collisions. The reason for this is because it won't be running the risk of a DUI because the person won't be driving and therefore has avoided a possibly fatal collision that would have happened if we didn't have driverless cars. The driverless cars could work in favor of people who do not get enough sleep, For example, let's say that there is a man who works 3 jobs. The man will wake up tired and drowy and when he gets in the car, he can avoid a crash that would have happened if HE was behind the wheel. The man will be able to rest and avoid a collision while the car itself drives him to work. Driverless cars will always have more Pros than Cons. A lot of people hate having to drive everyday to work or other places but now they won't have to because the car will do it for them. In conclusion I think there is no negative side to driverless cars and I can't wait to see the result of all the research that went into trying to develop the driverless cars.
