It would be in our advantage to use cars less,simply because there not good for the enviroment.

If we as human beings keep relying on cars as much as we do the world will be in bad shape

US as people have to treat the earth better because this is our home ,this is were we have to live and many generations after us have live .

The number of miles driven per person in america has definetly decreased over the years, the recession had a lot to do with that. With that being saidmany measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that recovery is underway. The rates of car ownership in america has also decresed. Maybe that means something more fundamental is going on.

By us using cars as much as we do pullution starts to happen. One of the biggest pollutes cars cause is smog.

smog is like fog but it contains gases and if we keep relying on cars as much as we do the world wont be a safe place for us to live. Smog got so bad in france that they had to stop people from drivng.

Maybe we should be more like vauban,germany and have less cars, '' when i had a car i was always tense, but im much happier without a car '' says heidrun walter . Vauban completed in 2006,is a growing trend in europe,the united states and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a compnent of a movement called '' smart planning ''

One if president obamas goals is to curve greenhouse gas emmissions, and i support that fully. studys sho that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licences as earch year goes by. This makes me question wether or not america hass passed peak driving. if this behavior persists the socioligists believe that we will have beneficialÂ  implications for carbon emmisions and the enviroment,sense transportation is the second largest source of americas emmisions.
