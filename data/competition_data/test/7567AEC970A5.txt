In today's society cell phones and technology play a huge role in our lives on a daily basis. If you were to sit in a room full of people an if you were to look around at everyone you would see that almostly 95% of the room is occupied by their phone. Either searching the internet, on social media, or sending a text message to somebody but they are making use of their cell phones either way. Should drivers be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. No because people are deciding to use their phone at the wrong time. An there has been just to many deaths dealing with cell phones for ridiculous reason.

We all know the feeling. you're driving and a text messages pops up on your cell phone. You have a reminder you wanna write down, and you really don't think about anything but picking up the phone. Within 5 seconds of looking at the phone , you could be halfway off the road, or already into an accident. Which may cause to injuries or even death. I just feel like whatever is on the phone, or whoever you texting is never that significant to cost somebody else life period. Many others will disagree with my opinion. But when you look deeper into it and really focus you'll understand where i'm coming from.

When driving, sometimes it's really hard to keep all your focus on the road. Which leads into making it extremely easy to forget that the road is shared by others and not just for one person. For this reason all cell phones usage should be banned while driving. I found on [Teensafe, 2018] that everyday 9 people in america died from a car crash. That has something to do with texting or driving or even being on the phone, and about 3,278 people die in the past 4 years for the same reason. People are just losing their life because others want to be selfish and not think about their surrounding. Not intentionally trying to take life's but just not fully thinking out their action.

Texting while driving as we all know, puts danger in many lives. A handful of youngins feels like staying attached to the outside world is way more well connected, than having all attention on the road. Altogether we just need to all stand on it to get a law passed about phone free while we are in our vehicles. In georgia has the same law it's called the hands free law. With this law being passed in atlanta georgia the accident rare, and also the death rate will decrease big time. When other states start to realise hopefully they do the same thing.

Using a cellphone while driving really does put multiple people's life in danger. It's time to put all distractions aside, and focus on what's really important when it comes to driving. As we all know phones have came a long way from generation to generation, and it is interfering in many lives. It's time to stand up for the safety of your life and the people around you. It could be someone in your family in an accident, it could be you. Just by making one change in your life , it can save your life . put the phones down, it can't be more important than a life.
