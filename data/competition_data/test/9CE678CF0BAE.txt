Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a great way to show people that we care about the economy and what we can do for it.

Students should be able to sign up for community service on our school board or have teachers send out fliers to students.

Some student will be interested in helping the way our city looks.

It can make a difference all over the world.

I strongly say students should be required to do community service.

Hard labor would teach students how its going to be when your older and matured in your life.

The kids that would be working in community service can b have it on they're resume. Unlike other simpletons sitting around playing games all day.

This would bring them out of their shell and show them what it could be like and not be like if they are not looking forward in life. They wont have a choice but do community service and pick trash off the ground.

This can also teach them self-control and not be a dunce in life.

Having no self-control can commit to health and behavior problems.

Problems like serious crimes and injuries.

Community service can help their self-control and make them have a meaning in life.

Students will not be forced to do community service but they will have to do at least 2 days worth. It can make a difference in the world and in the community.

It doesn't only have to be cleaning up either.

They could do fundraiser's, mowing lawns, and even going to a retirement home and caring for the elderly.

I believe community service would be perfect for students our school and community.

Please recommend issuing community service our schools.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
