If we were to limit our usage of our motor vehile's we'd salvage & try to repair our earth's polution problem. If we could switch over from using cars to bikes or any way of transportation not run on gas or anything that cause's damage to our O-zone , then i believe people would become healthier & more fit from the exercise of getting from one destination to another. Using motor vehicles is a lazy way of getting from place to place. but if we can comit to not using them or even just some days you dont drive then I believe we could help today's obieceity atleast a little bit.

If we could even limit driving in the big rural city's where everything is closer than in urban areas. I understand using motor vehicles to get from one far destination to another but their & back every single day is just destroying our earth. Polution is another effect driving does to the earth. In the German suburbs they have given up cars , people could learn some things about them. Their putting in effort to help save our earth from polution & other harmful things that come from driving so much for decades & decades.

I would love to live in a healthy & clean environment if we could work together to stop polution & damage to our O-zone perminantly. I love my life & would not want to end it any time soon. We were given life to enjoy ourselfs & be happy. Not to destroy oursleves along with it. Driving only causes polution & damage their are people that live in such poluted area's they cant leave their house because its bad that theyll get extremely sick. if we could chane that not only our world would be better but civilation as well.
