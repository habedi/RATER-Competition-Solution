Driverless cars are super new and talked about idea. Many people today love that idea of driverless cars. I completely disagree with that idea. Driverless cars can't perdicted whats happening around it or keep people 100 percent safe. Some exmples from the article "Driverlees Cars Are Coming" are we need smarter roads not cars, cars still need to alert people, and todays laws.

In the article, it descibes that "futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads". It also states that "the smart-road systems worked surprisingly well but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical". Driving cars dont have a course to follow all the time. What if you want to go off road or something random gets in the road. The car wont be able to stop or slow down to see those things.

Saddly the driverless cars are not driverless like they say. In the artlcle it talking about the cars steering, accelerating, and braking themselves but need a human skill to navigate thtough work zones and accidents. Even though a car with steering, accelerating, and braking and the cars alert you when u need to take over sounds amazing, to me it sounds very dangers. Think about it how much time do you have to react? If people are just sitting in these cars do you really believe people are going to watch the road? people will become way to relexed, i could see myself falling alseep. I don't feel as though the is very safe.

Driverless being legal is of course very important but that will need a change in traffic laws, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident. If a horriable acccident happens with a driverless car who is respondable? In the article it bring up that very good point. they are so many unknows and dangers of completely relying on a cars or on a person to watch the roads.

As my conclusion driverless cars can't perdicted whats happening around it or keep people 100 percent safe. The exmples I used to supports that is that we need smarter roads not cars, cars still need to alert people, and todays laws. Having driverless my be great for somethings in the furture but right now its so unprediable and unsafe. Driverless cars need alot more time to delovep and more laws need to be made and ready to go before driverless cars are.
