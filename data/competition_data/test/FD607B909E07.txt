A college study states that students are five times more productive when they work from home. This means that students would benefit from attending class from home. The reasons for this are, students are in a more relaxed environment and are less distracted by other peers.

When students have to leave home everyday and be around so many people it can get a little overwhelming. Meaning they are being put out of their comfort zones. This can cause them to show poor results in the classroom. One student said" While they attended school they were a straight C student, but when they began homeschooling their grades significantly increased." Later a parent stated that there kid had never been comfortable around large groups of people. This could have been avoided by removing that student from that stressful situation and allowing them to be home in a controlled environment.

It is a well known fact that students are distracted by their peers. This means students are missing important parts of class by talking with other students or watching other students do silly things in class. Taking these kids out of school, and leaving them at home to attend class makes them isolated from their peers giving them no distractions from others. This also allows their full attention to be on their work. This makes them more productive and able to take in more information.

When it comes to being comfortable or distracted at school these things all add up to one thing, limitations placed on students being able to learn at school. These things seem minor but they each play a role in students academic successes and can be avoided if you allow your student or child to learn from home. Being able to learn from home is a very beneficial idea that schools and teachers must take advantage of.
