Dear Principle,

I think the cell phone policy 1 that states ''Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time'' is was you should consider the new policy. This policy is both fair to the students and the teachers. I feel as though why should i have to leave my phone at home, if i can just turn it off during class time. Policy 2 is not fair at all. Students should have some freedom with there cell phones. The biggest concern with the phones being brought to school is that the students will have he phones out in class, and will not being paying the teacher no attention. So they feel to eliminate the problems students should just keep them at home huh? But with policy 1 it makes it so much fair for the teachers and the students. It lets the students bring there phones to school and pay attention in class at the same time.

In the video it demonstrated a lot of students using there phones in the classroom as well as the hallways. I think that in the scene where the video showed the students in class having his\her phone out is where the problem begins. If you had a policy like policy 1 you wouldn't have to worry about it. I understand that the students need discipline also but giving them the policy to have to leave there phones at home is so not fair. Letting the students know that we are giving you the privilege to bring your cell phone to school but you MUST turn them off while your in class time, or teachers have the right to convenscate them. i feel that's fair because if the students follow the rules that the phones must be off they wont have to even worry about there phones getting taking. I don't understand the problem with allowing the students to have there phones out while there at lunch or having free time. For example say if we are having a school activity such as a dance or a basketball game. Everybody doesn't enjoy these types of games\activitys. So maybe they would prefer to just sit down and maybe play a game or something on there phone. Me personality i would rather be on my phone then watch a boring basketball game but that's my opinion.

With policy 2 there are not all problems or cons with that policy. I just think that the students should have a say to. Policy 2 can eliminate a lot of problems such as the following,

-Getting your phone stolen.

-Getting it taking from a teacher for having it out.

-Not pay attention while your in class because your on it.

All of these possible problems can and might would happen but, as policy 1 states as long as they are off during class time. I think by allowing the students to bring there phones to school gives us more FREEDOM & RESPONSIBILLITY! The reason i think that is because if we could bring our phones to school knowing that if we have them out when were not suppose to then we will have consequences to face. So if we have the responsibility to bring them then we wouldn't do anything wrong. Also this is giving us more freedom
