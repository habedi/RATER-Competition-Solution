The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I feel as if this new techonolgy would make so many people be happier or at least cheer them up. "The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."

"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad." This new technology could examine your facial expressions to see if you are happy or sad. If an ad plays that you get sad or mad about this technology will play a different ad that expresses happy feelings to make you happy and put a smile on your face. "Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anaomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions." The new developing technology can read your facial motions.

"By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)." This software can read any type of facial expression and simpily make your day better. If you are already happy this software can just make you smile even more while you are on your computer. "Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."

"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This software would help so many students out because of how many students get bored with a lesson on the computer. This technology could help students get better grades and just makes school so much exciting for them.

"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions." This new software would be great for so many people at their computers, even students at school using the computers.
