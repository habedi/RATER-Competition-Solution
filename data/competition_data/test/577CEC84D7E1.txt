Dear, Principal

Do not take cell phone away, I think that policy 1 is the better choice for three reason and i will tell you them reasons in this letter. The first reason is that students need their phones to be able to get a hold of their parents if its an emergency or they need to tell them something important. The second reason is that the phone can be used for many reason, hear is one example, if u don't have or forget your calculator your phone can be used as a calculator. The third reason is that if the office or a teacher need to get a hold of a your parents or another family member, but they don't have that persons number you can give them the number from your contact list in your phone. So mainly what i'm trying to say is that cell phones are important so please don't ban cell phone privileges

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
