"Oh man I didn't make the soccer team!", yelled Generic_Name. "At least there are football tryouts next week", replied Generic_Name. "Im so glad that there are many extracurricular activities that our school provides!", said Generic_Name. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity in school because it could be a good use of time for them, they can create a passion for themselves, and they could help out the school.

A reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because it could be a good use of time for them. After school, many students play video games or take a nap which is not a good use of precious time. Instead, students could use their time wisely by staying active and helping out others. For example, Generic_Name plays video game all day long after school. If Generic_Name had something to do after school, it would keep away from video games and he could be having fun a different way.

Another reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities at school is because they can create a passion for themselves in doing so. Many students don't know what they want their career to be in the future. Being involved in extracurricular activities can help them find a passion for themselves. For example, Generic_Name signed up for art club for the first time. After his first few days, Generic_Name grew a passion for drawing and painting.

Before, Generic_Name wasn't sure about what he wanted to do when he grows up. Now, he wants to be a graphic designer and take his drawing skills to another level.

The last reason why students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they could be helping out the school. Kids can join programs that help out teachers and students. Programs like student council and more can make others jobs easier. For example, Generic_Name ran for student body president and won. Now, he can help out students and teachers when by decisions and changes for the school.

" I'm glad I got over my video game addiction", said Generic_Name. "Now I can focus on my future".

In conclusion, Students should participate in extracurricular activities because it could be a good use of time for them, they can create a passion for themselves, and they could help out the school.
