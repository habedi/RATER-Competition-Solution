Here at Generic_School, students must take at least one extracurricular activity. Students have several exciting choices, they could participate in school sports, be in the yearbook class (help put the yearbook together), or serve on the student council. Extracurricular activities is a great requirement for many reasons. One reason being, it allows students to take a break from their core classes. It allows them to get their minds off of all the stress put on them from the work they are doing everyday in those classes. It is also just amazing to be involved in your school. If you want to be involved in football for say, you would get to walk around every time there was a game, in your jersey or cheer leading outfit. There are many other sports students could get involved with like basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, cross country, etc. You do not have to be involved in a sport, to be involved with your school. Sports are not for everyone, although depending on what extracurricular activity you participate in, you could get extra advantages.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to get your mind off of all the stressful work going on in your other core classes. During your classes, you have to always stay focused on the work your teacher is giving out. If you do not finish that work, you either have to turn it in incomplete or do it for homework if the teacher is being nice. If you get to do it for homework, along with all the other homework you already had, you will be up late trying to finish. What if your Parents/ guardian, makes you go to bed, and won't let you finish? Then you have to turn it in incomplete, or use it as a late work and finish it the next night. Either way, you would end up getting a bad grade on the paper. It may not be the worst grade, but it's not your best work, and you always want to have your best work to be turned in. If this ends up happening constantly, your grades will start to go down. another way your grades can go down is if you fall asleep in class. It's hard enough to stay awake in class, especially right after you eat lunch, and then you have to go sit in a dark classroom, listen to the teacher, and attempt to take notes. It's almost like the teachers want you to fall asleep. When you cannot communicate, it makes it very hard to stay awake. That's why taking extracurricular classes are good for taking a social break away from your core classes.

It is always good to stay involved in your school. Extracurricular activities are a great way to do that. You have three option choices, sports, student council, or yearbook. You can always do more than one, you could do all three if you really want to. If you want to do sports you have lots of options like football, lacrosse, volleyball, cross country, basketball, etc. If sports are not for you, then that's okay because you still have other options. Student council is a group of responsible, chosen students. You get picked in home base at the beginning of the year, when your teacher asks "Who would like to be in student council?" If you raise your hand, your classmates will vote who they think would be best for the part. If you are n student council, then you know about all the upcoming events before anyone else does. It is your job to make a poster and present it to your home base the next morning. If you decide to take yearbook, then your job is to help put all the pages together. You will get a partner, and you guys will have a minimum of 2 pages, depending on what your topic is. You get to choose the pictures, and get the write the summaries for your pages in the yearbook.

With some of the extracurricular classes at forest middle you could get some extra advantages. Sports wise, if you are on the football team, you get fed before every game. If you play either basketball or volleyball, you get open gyms on certain days of the week. Sports are an after school activity, whereas student council and yearbook are during school. So if you are in student council, then you get to miss 1 day, every month, to go socialize and make posters, instead of going to your 7th period. Also the next morning you get all the attention from your home base all to yourself, like you are the teacher. Student council probably is not for you if you don't like talking in front of people. Unlike yearbook, is an everyday thing, although some times throughout the week you will just have all period to chill, and not do anything. Every Friday is called relaxation Friday. Relaxation Fridays you either do nothing except play games on our chrome books, some times get our phones, go to sleep, color, do homework for other classes, or do little math puzzles, but you always have options for your free period.

Overall, it is a good thing that our principle is pushing students to be more involved, and becoming a part of extracurricular activities. It is next to impossible to hate your extracurricular class, because the point in having them is to make school a little more fun. It's giving students a break, letting them get more involved with what's going on, and you even sometimes get extra advantages. Who wouldn't love it? I know I love my extracurricular classes.
