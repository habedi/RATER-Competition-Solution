Dear. Principle

I think you should let us students have our cell phones out during free time and during lunch. The reason I chose Policy 1 is because if we wanted our mom or dad to bring our lunch to school we could just call or text them on our phones instead of going to the office to call them. Another reason why is because if were in class and we are finish with our work we should be able to play games or listen to music on our phones but if we get to listen to music, we have to keep it down so no-one else could hear it or distract them out of their work. But once we go back to class from lunch or free time we should have our phones off until out teacher tells us we could listen to music or play games if they let us do so. I also think if the student is making bad grades they shouldn't be able to get on their phones at all during school hours! If the students is an A average then they should be able to get on their phones when their done with all of their work in the class. But student should be able to have their phones at school just in case any thing bad happen. THank you and have a nice d
