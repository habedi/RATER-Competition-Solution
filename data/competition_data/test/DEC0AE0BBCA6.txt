I think our principal should allow us to bring our cell phones to school as long as we use them on our breaks. If we use them on our breaks then it doesn't really bother anyone. If students use their phones in class then they don't pay much attention to their teachers. Students should know they can't use their cell phones in class.

I think students need to have their phones at school for example, in case of an emergency. Sometimes they need to contact someone to know when their leaving or going home. Without cell phones parents wouldn't know where their children are. Student sometimes need to make sure they can go over a friends house or just to let them know when they will be going home. If we use our phones on break then it wouldn't a disturbance to anyone. They can check the time or maybe just remind themselves of something they needed to do. On the other hand, having a phone in school isn't really a big deal.

If students have phones in class and they are turned on then it will distract them . I think as long as the teacher is strict about having phones turned on in class then students wouldn't use them. If students know the rule about cell phones then they wouldn't use them unless their bored in their class and want something to do. If students are really paying attention and are interested in what they are doing then it shouldn't be a problem. As long the teachers enforce the rules then I think students would rather do their school work.
