Imagine that you have started going to a newly built school and the school system has decided to set aside money to fund for extracurricular activities and sports. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity or sport. Do you agree with this? Personally, I believe that students should not have to participate for a few reasons: These activities can cause students to become injured or sick, they cost money and can take time out of a parents work day.

As we know, sports and other activities can be fun, but they also come with risks. Students can become injured or sick. If a student becomes injured, they may need medical attention or maybe even a surgery to help them get back to normal. This may also affect their daily life because they may need help carrying items or walking correctly. If a student is sick, they could spread it to other people or possibly affect their work in and out of school.

Our parents work very hard to make the money that they have. Extracurricular activities cost money, whether it is for a field trip or sports equipment. Unfortunately, many families in America don't make a lot of money and I see that as being another problem with the principle's decision. Field trips are also another fun part about extracurricular activities but some parents don't have enough money to send a child lunch to eat or even to be able to attend.

When it comes to work, our parents do a lot. They often will do anything to provide for their family. For example : A mom works double jobs to be able to provide basic needs for her kids and pay the bills every month. When students have sports or extra activities, this can cause them to have to leave work early for pick up or have to work over time for missing it.

Extracurricular activities and sports are not for everyone. In conclusion, this is why students shouldn't be required to participate in at least on extracurricular activity or sport because students can become injured or sick,the activities cost money and can take time out of a parents work day. Adults work very hard to provide for their kids and spend time with them.
