Education is a vital component to modern society's success, and it is imperative that every child in this world be given the opportunity to receive a proper schooling. It is not only important that a child be given the opportunity to learn, but it is a child's basic right. In addition to being provided with education, a child must be provided a safe learning environment in order to allow him or her to prosper and succeed. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and many children come home in tears or are unable to focus in the poor conditions present at the schools they attend. To combat this issue and provide schooling to a larger demographic, many school systems have implemented online schooling from home as an alternative to attending the school physically. This form of schooling has significant benefits to the students as it allows them to work in an environment comfortable to them, allows for easier access to an educational database, and allows them to work at their own pace.

Online schooling allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own home or wherever else they deem fit. Students have the freedom of choice and are able to learn from wherever they learn best from. This allows them to truly be engaged with the materiel being taught and allows them to retain more as they are not stressed about external or social factors. Often times in school settings, kids are worried about what their peers think about them, how they look, how they talk, bullying, etc. All of these factors combined create a negative learning environment and hinder many from achieving their true potentials. By providing an online schooling experience, many of this risks are mitigated, and students do not have to worry about anything other than what is being taught to them. This increases focus levels and allows students to learn better. Online school allows students to feel save and secure, creating a more positive environment, allowing for future success and prosperity. By giving students an environment in which they can learn and grow, students will be able to become active members of the community and will be able to benefit their society with their skill sets and determination towards the betterment of the future.

In addition to providing students access to a comfortable and safe learning environment, online schooling allows students to have access to school at the touch of a button. Due to natural disasters, deadly diseases, and poor transportation systems, many students find it difficult or nearly impossible to get to school on time or at all on some occasions. This hinders many children's abilities to learn as they simply cannot get to school. Giving students the access to this same schooling from home eliminates many of these issues and allows students to not have to worry about getting to school as they are already there. This allows students to have higher attendance rates and allows them to learn more as they are almost always present in the learning environment. In addition, this type of schooling is especially helpful for those that live far from their nearest school. Some kids can spend up to two hours a day just sitting on transportation alone. This time could be used more productively and undergoes a significant opportunity cost. Students get home tired from being in transport for so long and are thus unable to perform and do work up to maximum efficiency. Allowing students to work from home saves them time and allows them to spend this time further enriching themselves and delving into other academic or extracurricular ventures. This allows students to become more well rounded and overall, better and more successful people.

In addition to providing students access to school from the comfort of their own home and saving them time in transportation, online schooling allows students to work at a pace comfortable to them. Online schooling gives students access to all the resources they could need to succeed. This gives them the ability to learn in a manner that best fits their personal learning style and work at a pace that they are comfortable with. Since they have everything they could need, they do not have to scavenge through old-fashioned textbooks or stacks upon stacks of paper. Everything is available to them by simple clicks on a computer, allowing for information to be communicated more effectively and efficiently between student and teacher. This allows the student to not have to stress about keeping up with other students' speed of work as he or she can finish on his or her own time. The students do not need to be worried about how fast the teacher is going as they can just re-watch a recording of the video later. Online schools give students the freedom to work worry free and at a speed that they know they can succeed in. This, in turn, allows students to absorb more information and work diligently towards their goals. Giving students the opportunity to work at their own pace allows for them to become better time managers and more organized as they have to make schedules by themselves. It lets children become more independent and prepares them better for the future, more than any physical school could.

While many people may think that online schools are unable to provide the same experience and hands-on learning as physical schools, this is simply a modern misconception. In reality, online schools do an exceptional job at providing the exact same, if not better, education to their students. They ensure to provide a hand-on learning experience through engaging and interactive activities and lectures. Online schools are simply not inferior to physical schools in anyway and in some cases, are more advantageous to their students. The advancement of the internet and the extensive infrastructure online schools have built enable them to provide their students with a comprehensive education without sacrificing any liberties present in physical schools.
