i think students shouldn't be force to do community service because some students don't have the time to do it. students are to busy as it is . community service is something students should do on there free will.

students like myself wouldn't find the time to do community service because were to busy in other stuff such as study and doing the homework that are teachers have given us to do. students are far to busy and wouldn't find the time.

i know a few students that for sure wouldn't have the time to do community service because they also have to help there parents around the house, and now we may even be require to do community work for the city. by the end of they day most students would be exhausted from all the work. and that wont be so good for use for school. students need there rest for such things like p. e and texts. teachers always say to get plenty of rest and sleep the day before a test.

i know helping he city is a important thing to do but be require to help isn't the answer students need to help on there own free will. if students go on there on free will that may be different because they may find the time to do some community service. but no one would like doing something they really don't want to do. i just wouldn't be fair knowing that now we may be force to do community service.

i hope this letter will help you to understand that no one would like to be force to do community service while will still need to do other work. it just to much for us students. students just wouldn't find the time.
