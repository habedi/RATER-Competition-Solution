Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, the students can do their classes whenever they have time and they dont have to worry about going to class every morning or every evening.

The students who take online classes are more likely not to be bother by anyone and they can be more focus in their classes more than other stuff around them.

The students with online classes have more time during the day which they can use either to work or do other activities that have to do with the classes.

One reason why the the students with online classes could be a bad idea is if they have kids they might be iterrupted by the students children but if the students have online classes they can be on the look of their kids and also can spend time with their kids,and that's why the student should benefit from being able to attend to classes from home.
