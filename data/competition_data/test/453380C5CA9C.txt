Dear Principle,

I think that changing the school policy is a good thing because people that want to play sports will try to do better in school and we will have more people doing better because they play sports. professional athletes wouldn't go any where if they didn't do good in school. In the NBA people have to be smart to remember the plays and all the things they need to do to score or to stop the other team from scoring.

When i played sports I would have to remember where to throw and where to run. my coach always said school before baseball if I was getting bad grades he wouldn't play me so I always did good in school. Some times i would have to do a project so I would miss practice or a game. every time i told him it was school work he would understand. He used to be a teacher so he wanted us to do really good in school.

My Basketball coach said that if we missed school don't come to practice because he wanted us to do really good in school. when we don't want to go to school we say just suck it up so we can go to school. i never missed a practice with my coaches.

that is why I think we should change the school policy also when people are close to getting kicked off the team they will try as hard as they can to stay on the team.
