In my opinion and support from the passages reducing car use or stopping car usage all together is a great thing. It's safer, helps the environment, and saves money.

Reducing car usage to almost none makes it a lot safer for kids to run around the streets and play and for parents to not stress about their kids getting hit by a car. There's also a lot less accidents without cars on the road. Think about it, 2 cars hitting into each other both people could possibly die, but if 2 bikers hit eachother both are more than likely able to walk away from it with maybe a couple bruises and a broken bone.

What if you never had to pay for gas ever again? That'd be awesome right? All you have to do is not use your car anymore and just ride a bike, walk, skate or find other means of transportation. You'd save lots of money. In Vauban once car use was out of the picture everything was placed in walking distance and there wasn't even a need for cars any more unless you were traveling out of the country somewhere.

Also, reduciong car usage helps keep the Earth a lot cleaner and the air would have a lot less pollution in it which would also make it safer for us to breathe and healthier for us to breathe in. Congestion went down by 60 percent after 5 days of reducing car use in the Capital of France.
