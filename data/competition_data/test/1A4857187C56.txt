How does summer projects interfere with a students summer plans? What does the students and the school board gain from these projects? It has been said that summer projects help with teaching students over the break. Teachers are more likely to make a student read a book and do a book report about it or do research on a specific topic. Students have a wide imagination, therefore, the projects given by them may have interesting tasks. Teacher-designed and student-designed projects both have advantages and disadvantages. School summer projects are best being student-designed because the students know what they will finish, it would be more interesting, and they would understand it better.

If summer projects were student-designed, the students will be able to complete them because they know what they will be able to do and what they feel like doing. Some teachers, when assigning a summer project, give too much work for a student to complete. When teens are given too much work, they tend to fold under pressure and not give their best efforts towards their work. Also, not every student is as fortunate as the next one. Many students aren't able to go to a library on the regular or have the utensils that they need for the project. Everything in the world costs money and a student shouldn't be deprived of their grade because they aren't wealthy enough to provide for their project. Furthermore, if a student designs their project they will still be able to have an interesting and exciting summer. Teens will make sure that whatever they plan for themselves will leave time to get out of the house instead of being overwhelmed with school work during the summer. Students know their mindsets and their home issues, so its best they create a project that fits them.

A student-designed summer project won't make the students feel like they're being forced to complete a task. Since the students are the ones creating the project, they will feel as if they have enough freedom to do what they want to do. This can help with completion since they already have something in mind from when they created the prompt. If a student was to design a summer project, they will be able to express their creativity. Many students have great talents that they can show to other people while teaching them instead of doing a presentation on something that they don't feel shows what they can do. In addition, students will make their project prompts interesting and attention grabbing. They won't make something that people will be bored with because they had the opportunity to create what was on their minds. When a student makes their own project they can surprise teachers and other students with talents nobody knew they had such as: drawing, poetry, and making music.

On the other hand, many people feel that summer projects are better teacher-designed because it helps students stay on task. Every student will have one thing to do and it will make it easier for students to remember what their project was about. Teacher-designed projects will also make it easier for the teachers to grade the work. No students' projects will have to be recorded because they will all be able to access through a computer or easy to remember. Despite these reasons, student-designed projects are better because it's an easier way to help students learn. Students can make songs to remember what they learned and teach other students about the information that they received through their songs. It will be one-hundred percent more interesting than going through about twenty-five presentations that look exactly the same.

In conclusion, student-designed projects are more helpful to the students and the teachers because they're more creative, manageable, and understandable. It's very hard to stay focused during presentations when everybody has the same way to express their information. Teachers can also that the ideas that the students used to teach the class and use them for their everyday classes. Student-designed projects will make summers better, not only for the students, but also for the school-board and the teachers.
