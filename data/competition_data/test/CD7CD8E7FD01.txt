If I was asked, I realy hate doing homeworks or any type of projects. But if have to choose, I think the students should design the project. Therefore, it will be easier for the students to do the project. For example, when i was in middle school my teacher asked us to pick a topic for our History class. So I picked the history of Japan, which is easy for me because i already know a lot of Japans history. Consequently, I finished my project and I got a one hundred on my project.

First of all, The reason why i picked Japanese history is because number one I already know a lot of Japanese, number two I'm half Japanese so what can really go wrong. Since I was a little kid my mom would always tell me about my Japanese dad and their culture in Japan. For example, I learned that in Japan when you say good bye to people that is on a higher position than you, you always have to bow. In America when your eating and your making loud noises while chewing, Americans consider it as disrespectul. But in Japan when you eating noodles and your making loud noises it means that you really love their food and chef likes that. I learned all of this from my parents thats why when i picked Japanese history i know it will be easy for me.

Secondly, Learning Japanese culture is fun and easy for me, one of the reasons why i picked it is because I already know a lot about it that, if my classmates will ask me questions about my project i can answer it easily. For example, if they ask me like what is the money called in Japan, I can answer it and say yen.

If they ask me does Japan have a President, I will say no because Japan does not have a Presisdent, they have a Prime Minister. Therefore, If they ask me all these questions I can answer it because I know a lot of things in Japan.

On the other hand, When you know so much about it that it can be boring sometimes. therefore you can get lazy and not finsih your project. thats why i always try to make things intersting and fun. For exmaple, I try to learn Japanese words and put it on my project, or I can put Japanese brands that my classmates never heard before. things like this makes me excited. because i can't to answer their questions on how i know a lot about Japan.

Lastly, If ever I have to design my own project I would pick something that I'm interested in. Such as, sports and history, science etc. Doing projects or essays can be boring so why not pick something that your intersted in and make it not boring, specially in summer projects. Doing something that you love will always be easier. Thats why in opinion students should design their own projects because it will be easier for them.
