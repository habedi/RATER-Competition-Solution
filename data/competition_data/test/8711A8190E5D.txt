We deserve to play sports and to participate in other activity's because we go to the school and we get the grade required for the classes. I think the school should let us play sports and participate in activity's because if we don't we wont be able to play the sports we want. I think you should change it because most kids have a c grade average. Maybe these kids can help the school sports teams. If we let them maybe we could win a trophy for the school. When kids are denied school events they could call the school bored and get the principal in trouble and maybe even get fired. The parents will get furious and march down to the school and argue with the principal that their child deserves to play that certain sport or go and play that activity. If the parents get mad enough they will pull the child out of school and the school will cut funding. Also, if the child doesn't participate the child could do worse and fail the California standards test and drop the schools percentage. The school will have a shortage of team members in sports because most kids have a c average. If the kid doesn't participate he would not know how to participate as a team mate. That is why i oppose this new school policy and want the old policy back.
