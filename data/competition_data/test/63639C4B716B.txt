Phones and Driving

Upon the development of handheld computers, more commonly known as "smart phones," the question arises whether, when driving, they are a necessity or a deterrent. Both sides of the argument induced by this question are accurate in some way and folly in another; and so there will always be debate over the subject, with both sides just as right and just as wrong as the other for different reasons. To elaborate upon this further, one might argue that phones should not be allowed in motorized vehicles while they are being operated due to the implication of a distraction. On the other hand, however, one might also argue the necessity of GPS and availability for work. Some laws are put in place to help prevent accidents through negligence because of the need to sometimes carry a device; the only trouble is that people abuse the rights they do have and many can be found texting or holding a phone up to their ear with only one hand or nothing but their knee on the steering wheel. Not only do those drivers have less control of the steering wheel, but they also often get distracted by conversation and drive recklessly. These individuals are the ones the counter argument against phones in motor vehicles will often refer to. The argument about phones and driving is controversial to say the least, and while often neglected it is important to carefully analyze all factors contributing before speaking or constructing an argument or opinion about the subject.

Cell phones did not exist when cars were first beginning to be produced on a massive scale in 1908 with Henry Ford's Model T, and wouldn't exist for another sixty five years after its development. Laws were never necessary for the implication of cellphones because they did not yet exist, but when cellphones were invented they, in certain cases, became a real problem for people on the road. Since then the cell phone has advanced in an amazing way, rather than a big brick . The first computer was a enormous invention, large enough that one could easily fill an entire room. Today, we have advanced so much on the principle of the computer that we have eventually developed a hand held portable computer that is now in everybody's pockets. Also to be noted is that the first cellular phone was by no means the super computers they are today; they too were big and bulky, and were only good for making phone calls like an ordinary telephone. These amazing advancements have become the very necessities we rely on today, the great majority of which developed only in recent years, and are now staples of modern society.

The most controversial subject outside of laws already put in place about cell phones and driving is manner of necessity, and manner of liability.

There is no one correct party in this argument, because there is always a valid and considerable counter argument to every point which can be made on either which side; wherefore every argument which can be made is only a half truth. The folly of individuals on both polarities of the argument is the inability to understand the importance or reason behind any opinion that in any way opposes their own. The fact of the matter is, neither of which party is entirely correct in their accusations based on the bias of their opinion on the subject. Cell phones are an important and useful tool, whether you need to carry one at all times for work or simply the convenience of having a device with which you can get ahold of outside sources in dire conditions and utilize the availability of GPS if needed. People should most certainly keep their cell phones with them while their driving; but people are often known to abuse this right by recklessly focusing on their device at unnecessary times when driving. To utilize your device properly is the best option rather than to follow each extreme of all or nothing, but the problem still stands and will always stand for the sheer fact that motorized vehicles and cell phones simply exist that there will be those who will not follow this code of conduct, despite any laws which could be implemented.

The general population needs to be encouraged somehow to go about their business responsibly. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible to achieve by any conceivable means on a large scale, and certainly impossible to convince every individual entirely. This will always be a problem in society with any and all causes, and it is up to the rest to withhold these laws and maintain both order and safety. The only thing people can truly do to resolve a situation where somebody is recklessly driving due to negligence while texting or otherwise using their mobile device, is to report the incident to law enforcement for the safety of other individuals on the road. Motorized vehicles are a wonderful utility but they are unsafe, accidents can happen simply by not being careful and often result in death or serious injury.

The best and only thing we can do is to just drive with caution and alertness at all times, especially considering that people are unpredictable and anything can happen on the road.
