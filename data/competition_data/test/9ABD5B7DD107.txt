Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have just been informed that you have been thinking about changing our school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I understand your concern about us student averages and educations , but I think that it would be a little harsh if you were to change the rules because some students really do try their best, and still end up with an C average. I personally think that you should change the rule to that if you have a C average and missing work in that class then you shouldn't be able to participate in sports or any other after school activities. But if you have a C average and no missing work then your able to participate in after school activities.

The reason I think it should be done this way is because some students turn in all their work and still end up getting a C, because they got a bad grade on a test or something. I'll admit that most students do play around and do not turn in work, but end up getting lucky on a test or something along those lines, and still pull out a C average in that class. That in which them should not be rewarded.

I also do understand your concern about some students not understanding the material that is being taught to them. if that is to be the case them the student's that are having trouble or need a little help, they should come to an adult. They should not just sit in class and pretend they understand what they are learning and end up at the end of the year failing because the did not have the courage to ask for help. But that would not be all the students fault. Our teachers should be more open and inviting to the students. I'm not saying the teachers should become friends with the students, I just think that the teachers should be come friend with the students. The students should just be comfortable enough to open up to the teachers with out rejection.

So in conclusion I think that the rules should be changed but not to where we students have to have a B average to participate in after school activities. The rule should be changed to where if you have a C average but no missing work you can participate. But if you do have missing work in the class that you have a C average in then you can not participate, because that shows that did not do your personal best in that class. This is why the rule should not be change to where you have to have a B average to participate in after school activities.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
