Would you ever like seeing what is out there? Luke Bomberger had a friend name Don Reist who invited Luke to a Europe cattle boat. Luke said yes, it was an opportuinty of a life and he is not giving that up. Luke was exuberant that he was going on a trip. He could not wait till the day.

Luke got to go to cool places he never been to. He got to visit Europe, China, Greece, and Italy. There is also help for countries to recover what they lost like food supplies, animals, and more. The UNRRA hires Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules. You also get to have fun on the boat especially after the animals get unloaded. One time it was raining and a there was a small strip of metal and he slid from keepinhg him from falling of the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adveture, but it opened up the world. It made Luke more aware of people of other countries and their needs. This made Lukes awareness stay with him. That also lead his family to a host of international students and exchange visitors for many years. Luke was grateful for the opportunity. You should join you will have an excelent time.
