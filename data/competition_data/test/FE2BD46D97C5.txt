I believe policy number one is the best policy because lunch time is their free time to do whatever you don't see adults bosses telling them they cant use a cell phone on their break or telling them they cant do stuff its their free time they can do whatever they want within the law. So why cant students do whatever they want within the law during their free time. I believe having phones in a class room would not be constructive but at lunch and their free time they don't have to be doing anything constructive hence why its called "free time". Their also must be consequences set up just in case a student is using his/her phone in class. Like maybe step one verbal warning, step two take phone away just that period, step three have them pick it up at the end of the day, step four give the phone to the principal and make the students parent s come in and pick it up with the consequence.
