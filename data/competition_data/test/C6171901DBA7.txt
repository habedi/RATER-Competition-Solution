For the average, 21st Century American, technology has vastly changed day to day life. Machines have taken up some of the work in manufacturing goods, Cars are starting to drive themselves, and theres even an app that can deliver a Big Mac to your door in under a half an hour. If society has evolved into a world of technology, why not let that technology change the way our kids learn for the better? Students would be better off with having an option for online education, because it would provide for a more flexible way to learn, a "Plan - B" in the case of a long term school closure, and another option to receive an education for children in unfortunate situations.

For some kids, going through the typical 8am to 4pm school day can feel pretty monotonous. Even your average core class tends to have lots of downtime that makes students wonder, "why am I even here?" With an online education, students who hate wasting their time are able to move through curriculum at their own pace, and whenever they see fit. No more sitting in a florescent lit room wondering if whether the asbestos or the sheer boredom will kill you first. Instead children will be able to set their own parameters for how to get through the days course load. Online school has the potential to bring efficiency to the forefront of education.

Another issue that becomes for and more relevant by the day is how education in America is supposed to continue in the case of a long term school closure. It has become increasing likely that the United States will end up closing all public schools due to the widespread intensity of the Novel Coronavirus. The virus has already infected around one thousand people in the US and that number is likely to rise exponentially. In the case of a massive school closure, an online option for public education would be a clever way to keep education in America from grinding to a halt. A close to normal way of life for the foreseeable future will almost certainly require an online education.

Finally one issue that an online education could partly remedy is how kids with unfortunate home lives properly receive an education. With the flexibility of online schooling, Older students who happen to live in poverty would be able to have a job during the day to bring money home to their families, While still getting a good education when they are off the clock. An online school would also help children with chronic illnesses or disabilities as students and parents would be able to structure the childs' schooling to fit with the needs of that specific child, resulting in a more personalized and thus more useful education.

While some might argue that online school could stunt the development of social skills for some children, I would make the case that, while online school certainly isnt for everyone, having an option for students to choose the way in which they learn makes the idea of school far more appealing for most students. Online learning provides for an efficient, flexible, and safe way to learn, and every American should have the option to be a part of it.
