Introduction in my opinion kids should not stay after school to do extracurricular activitys. I dont think kids would be happy or satisfied about having to stay after school. A lot of kids dont have the time or energy to stay after after school. In my personal bias I dont enjoy staying after school becuase I like to play video games with my friends.

Some kids dont enjoy staying after school

When kids stay after school they decide to make that decision so they can stay with their friends or make friends. A lot of kids who dont stay after school do stuff outside of school they already might be participating in sports or just hanging out with their freinds outside of school. What the principal offerred to the students was not a popular choice with the students not all kids can draw, run or debate and think well.

Kids would get mad that they might have to stay after

Let me get into more detail about how kids would react if they had to stay after school. Kids, all over social media probably making dun of the school for deciding to make that decision. they would call it stupid and bad words because they would not be happy about that concept. The students would probably not stay after school becuase they would not want to stay fter school

Kids have trouble making groups if you try to stay after school for a sportand try to join a group they will kick you out. Students like to exclude people that are inferior to them and irelavant people. I have been thru exclusion before its not a good feeling. Being in a club that you dont know anyone makes it worse. When you have no one to make a group with its very awkward and shaming. Kids are cruel and savages there are not alot of nice kids around.

Conclusion

In conclusion I do not think that kids should not stay after school or forced to stay after school. In reality kids dont really care for that stuff at all. Kids can be mean and savages and can exclude people. Kids with no freinds will have trouble having fun if their going to sit by themselves.
