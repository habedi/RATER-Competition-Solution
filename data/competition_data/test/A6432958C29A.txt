Sorry I can't, I have something afterschool. Get used to that, because you're going to hear it everyday. I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it's time consuming, kids want a choice, and they might already do things after school.

First of all, doing an extracurricular activity is time consuming. What if your parents/guardians can't get you there, and you can't get a ride from anyone else? Do you just skip it, or do you have to find something else to do? Also what if you want to do multiple activities, but they're on the same day and you don't have time for both? After school it's already like three o'clock, you should eat and have at least some time to relax, and if a club or sport runs long, you might not be able to finish your school work afterwards, or get enough sleep for the next day.

A second reason I would disagree is that kids want a choice at what they do. If they're being forced or required to do something, they're most likely going to resist doing whatever it is for the sake that they're simply being required to do it. Kids might also become uninterested if they didn't really like whatever the activity is in the beginning, but they still had to do it. Would there be a grade dependent on this extracurricular activity, whether a kid is doing one or participating, since it would be required? Or should we just be kept busy? If it's graded, kid's are going to not want to do it even more because it's practically more school, just after school.

The last reason I disagree about kids required to do at least one extracurricular activity is, what if they already have things after school, like family plans, jobs, or tutoring? Kids are already tired from school but requiring and packing on them to do more , that's exaughsting. Whatever they do is going to be physical or mental. I don't know about you but I can't do physical activity if i'm not in the right mindset, and I can't do mental things if my brain's worn out from a long day. Another thing you should think about is the cost. Most extracurricular activities can get pretty expensive quickly, and some families don't have the money for it.

In conclusion, I showed why I disagree with the statement, that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and that's because, it's time consuming, kids want a choice, and they might already do things after school.
