Do you think students should play sports? Yes! I agree students should play spots. Students should play sports because sports will help students with they health,keep students out of trouble,and help students stay off technology.

First,sports will help students with they health. When students play sports they have to move around a lot and drink a lot of water. However when students drink a lot of water and move around a lot they can lose weight. Also students will want to eat health food and not junk food. Sport will help out students with health problems.

Next,sports keep students out of trouble. Students will want to do good in school and get good grades to play in the games and to stay on the team. However if students don't keep the good work up they not going to be able to play in any of the games and they will no longer be on the team. Also if students play sports they will stop skiping class and fighting. Sports will keep a lot of students on track.

Last,sports will help students stay off technology. Now days all students do is play video games and sit on they cell phones. Everything that students do today is on technology. However if you look up how many students that play sports it's only 90% of students in the world that play sports. Students need to stay off technology and play sports more.

In conclusion,sports is something that every student should play. Sports will help students in a lot of ways. I agree that students should play sports because sports will help students with they health,keep students out of trouble,and help students stay off technology.
