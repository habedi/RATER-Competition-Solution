i think cell phone should be brought to school and allowed to be used during lunch periods and free times because if we couldn't students would try to use there phones during class time and get them taken away. Another reason is if students could be able to use there phones they wound pay more attention and could focus in class better. If students wouldn't be aloud to bring cell phone they will still bring them and text in class as much as possible. a lot of them would get cough and after school the office would be crowded with students trying to get there phones back. I think the principle would ratter allow students to use there cell phones during any break time. and wont have to go thru any trouble with cell phones any more. This is why i think students should be able to bring cell phones to school.
