The 4 sources talked about the advantages of limiting car usage, but also the reaction of people and what they think about it, if they're for or against what the government made for a solution of car usage problems. We can see that the number of cities hwo cared about those environmental problems increased, and so they reacted by different methods.

We're living because of nature, without nature we can't live. People finally react because of the warnings of nature, for example: Smog in Paris, "despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota". They finally saw the problems that they caused. So that, Gorvernment found some solutions to have less smog, so they banned driving but none all of them will stop driving if they don't talk about money, so they made some fine (31$) if they don't leave their cars at home. As they expected, not all of the french people obeyed it because we all know that Paris is an extremly busy city that can't avoid of using cars even if they have to pay. But people have to see how the environment is really bad because of cars.

Limiting car usage is very important and it's mostly because of the environment, because the number of people using cars is increasing every year. The nature is now becoming scary because of us. Let's think about what will happen in the futur when you will have children, we're not even sure if they are going to live because all the damage that we committed to the environment, I'm sure one day the nature will take a revenge and it's just at that moment that we will realize that we made a horrible and big mistake.

Look how happy the germans hwo live in that city that don't have cars anymore... Or just a few but not that many cars. They are showing us that we can live without all those cars, and they said that it's "less stressful", and it's good for the body. They are different methods to avoid those cars, EVRETHING IS ACCESSIBLE EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE CARS, their is a lot of ways to change places, like bycicles in New York, or you can walk, and there's even buses that can take more passengers than a simple car hwo is too big for just one person. It's world-wide now, the number of cities hwo reacts is increasing everywhere. Than why not us ? Let's do the same and don't forget to think about your futur and the futur of your children.
