I my name is Luke I am a seagoing cowboy. Being a seagoing cowboy is a lot of work but I managed to have some fun on board with my buddys and I think you will meet a lot of nice people if I could have fun you can to.

My Buddys and I like to play table tennis , volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

There are a lot of responsirbiltes, you have clean the stalls and have night watch. You get to see a lot of amazing places, I have been to italy and China. You have to be very careful when its raining it can be very silpery and watch where you step if you know what i mean (poop).

Another reason why I became a seagoing cowboy is it held some new adventure so if you are the advertures type you might want to be come a seagoing cowboy someday.

I'm just trying to say it is a great opertunatie to becaome advertures person or an exicting person and you never no maybe you go down in history some way some how. Even if you don't go down history you will have a lot of story's to tell the grandchildren.
