Dear TEACHER_NAME

It has came to my attention that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I personally am happy, because my cell phone is a big part in my life. I use it all the time and so do my parents. It's very convenient to have during the school year. Most of the cell phones today have internet access. Including my phone. That is something very useful to have even for school. I even see some teachers have their cell phone on one day, because they are expecting a very important phone call.

One of the policies I see you are considering is to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. I think this is the better choice, because if you ever forgot a homework assignment or gym clothes or something important you can ask your parent to drop it off.

Some teachers disagree with this because they say why don't the students just use the office phone? Well if you ever considered what students use the phone, you wouldn't want to use it ever again. A lot of students who call to home are sick. I doubt that the secretaries at the office constantly disinfect the phone.

Also if your parent does drop off something and the secretary announces it over the loud speaker, it disrupts the class. If you had you cell phone, you and your teacher would be the only ones who knows about it. Not the entire class.

I do think that is the better choice and a lot of students will agree as well, but i do see some problems with it. I could predict that because we could use the cell phones during free periods and lunch, most of the students would forget to turn them off. Therefore a there could be more disruptions.

Usually a couple of times a year at least one student's phone goes off during class. I think that this would happen more often because we would be aloud to use them. I think that the policy at school we have now is just fine. We are aloud to have them in school, just put away in the lockers.

I have to admit that when I'm doing my homework and my phone is right next to me, I easily get distracted. I'm sure that a lot of other students would agree that they too get distracted.

I understand that I have to pick one policy and I still think that policy number one is better, but there are problems to it. If I were you TEACHER_NAME, I would just keep the cell phone policy how it is today, or revise policy number one. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
