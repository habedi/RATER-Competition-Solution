While cars have made our lives so much simpler in the aspect of transporting ourselves efficiently, there are a few drawbacks. Some cities have made efforts to reduce these drawbacks. Limiting car usage cuts down on pollution and saves money but makes transportation less efficient.

Limiting car usage cuts down on pollution. An example of this is in Paris when they had a smog problem, "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." Paris had a smog problem, and limiting car usage prved to be an effective solution. Another example of limiting car usage cutting down on pollution is in Bogota, Colombia. They had a car-free day to reduce smog. "Â…cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million." Colombia has a day without cars to cut down on air pollution. This has beed proven to be an effective solution to smog.

Clearly, living without cars is not only a vision of environmentalists, it's a reality. Cars could eventually no longer be needed if more countries support this movement. If this creative, clean craze hits America, we might have a future that is a breath of fresh air.
