Taking classes online always has its pros and cons for students. Distance learning would benefit students in many ways and save them lots of time! I believe that taking classes at home would help students extremely much with basic stuff such as time management and finishing work. Video conferencing would be very nice to have with online classes so you and your teacher can communicate when needed. The video conferencing would also be great for group projects so if you have nowhere to meet, you can just call each other.

When you take online classes it usually results in students getting more sleep. Students will get more sleep because there would be no need to rush to get ready in the morning. This is very beneficial because students will wake up well rested and will be able to knock out those online classes like it's nothing.Â Distance learning also saves time because you won't have to drive to school or take the bus. Which also saves money if you have a car. For students who struggle with waking up and getting the sleep they need, taking online classes can help you very much with that.

For some students, online classes could help with their mental health. That is because online classes tend to be less stressful and that could help many students in the United States. At home you can take multiple breaks to rest your brain before starting again. As long as you stay caught up with the online class you won't have to worry. More students could find it helpful than you think. There's a lot of teenagers who can let their emotions get to them and they don't have that health mentally that all students should have. I just believe that giving online classes could help everyone in their own ways and succeed with it.

Online classes would also be great for students that do not enjoy the social aspect of school. Not everyone enjoys the loudness and chaos that schools have. Online classes would be a great way for students like that to really excel without distractions around them. Obviously there would still be video conferencing to communicate with the teacher so not complete silence but there's no students being loud around you. Nobody enjoys trying to do work when students around them are being loud. Why let these students distract you when you can go home, work in silence, and get stuff done? That's why online classes help everyone in their own significant ways.

I believe that many students should try distance learning and see how it benefits them. By staying at home and taking online classes it can help a single student very much. This is because you'll get more sleep, mental health, and silence for worksheets and homework. More schools should offer distance learning for all these reasons and more! The schools should help the students as much as they can and help them reach their full potential.
