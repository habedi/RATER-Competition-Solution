Phones and Driving is No Bueno

Phones and driving have been around or influenced in our society for a very long time. Fatal injuries of friends, families, or even fellow class mates have been a victim to this incident. We have the option to say no more! Why wouldn't the state governments all throughout the U.S. want to induce a law such as this in each state? For certain we could create a major decrease in the percentages of car crashes for our citizens. Think of when you are walking, you don't stare into your phone because you will bump into other people walking, so why would you do that while driving? Therefore, phones and driving should be banned due to poor results and statistics.

There are roughly about more than one hundred thousand people who are involved with phones while driving. For example, Mississippi has banned texting and driving, but has yet to ban holding the phone in their hand while driving. Now think to yourself, what are the chances of someone responding to a hilarious text from their friend? Deep down I believe anyone's answer would be a high chance. The moment you take focus off the road even if it's for half of a second, you increase your chance of being able to miss something causing you to make a horrible judgment call on the road. A quarter percent of car crashes is due to the usage of a cellphone. We should have the encouragement to change that quarter into a penny or no chance at all!

How much do you value your life? Even if your answer to that is "Not much at all.", what about someone you cherish and that cherishes you? People tend to do more for others over themselves. Also, passengers of your vehicle aren't the only ones that you are accountable for. That's right; think of the pedestrians who tend to use their feet as transportation. You have a high chance of endangering them if you take your focus from the road and onto your phone. Even if no one matters to you and all that's in value to you is money, you're still in for a rude awakening. If you think insurance is a burden to you and your financial life right now just think about how a citation for texting and driving will affect you. Think about your life and how multiple areas of it can potentially be affected by a poor action to use your phone while driving.

What most people don't know is that the mind is trained to do one thing at a time in the result of having controlled and efficient focus. Imagine how the usage of a phone can take your mind from what is in front of you on the road. You mentally must be in a good state to perform safe driving. Teen drivers can be affected by this heavily. Due to a little amount of experience of driving. One more thing that can affect their driving is social media and how it is excessively used in today's generation. Last thing parent's want is a phone call stating that their kid has been in a car accident. We could simply all agree on this.

In conclusion, phones and driving should be banned due to poor results and statistics as we stated above. We have a huge percentage of human beings that are affected by this distraction. We need to take away the cause, so the effect ceases. High values are at a major risk if you make the mistake to use your phone while driving. So, the next time you drive, take your values into consideration. You need to take full control of your focus and create a great, determined, and powerful state while driving. Don't get caught up in this distraction, it isn't urgent while you are driving, get to your destination safely first!
