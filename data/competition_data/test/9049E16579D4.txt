Dear Principal i think all the students at this school should do community service because it would be helpful for these students to learn responsibility. Plus they will gain respect from there peers. also they might even get good jobs that require them to have more responsibility. Then they will grow up helping there kids with there chores and responsibility.

For example if a kid who never does any of his chores. That person will grow up lazy working at a dead end job living paycheck to paycheck. another example some one who does there chores. That person will grow up with a good paying job and not worried about how he is going to pay the bills next month. When the kid grows up he may want to be a motivational speaker. Trying to help the world become a better place. It doesn't matter what your friends think. Get some new friends.

Friends that support you in what u do Don't worry if they think its stupid

Just know that you will be helping your family just like they helped you when you were little. You can help them by getting a good job paying the bills ahead of time.
