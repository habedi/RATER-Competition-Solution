Dear mrs. Principal,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I am writing on behalf of the cell-phone policy. I think cell phones during passing periods would be great because if a student needs to talk to someone on the other side of campus while walking to class, a cell phone would be a perfect device for such a problem. I also agree that they be turned off during class. Not only a great idea, but a way to keep students interested in school.

Having only 45 minutes of class and 8 periods a day with 3 minute intervals is plenty of time for someone to get where they need and enough time to talk to someone quickly on their cell phones, or during lunch. If a student's mother needed to talk to him/her they could easily call during lunch time. Or any relative or friends. They could inform the student about family troubles or if they were coming to pick them up later on, for a doctor's appointment. I think that only 8th grade and up should be allowed this perk because 7th grade and below wouldn't pay attention where they are walking or pay attention to someone administrative walking into them by accident. Then the cell-phone policy would become too strict and if someone needed to call their mother about a family emergency they would not be able to. just because some isn't walking in the right way could harm the whole grades chances of being able to get this treat.

If someone were to spoil the chances of this treat for everyone else then i think there should be single punishments for offenses from certain students. If a student has a repeat offense then they should be punished by themselves. If someone were to mess up for the first time then they shouldn't be punished unless it was serious, but also speaking, what if administrators were to run into a student, they should be punished, by a $15 fine just as well as anyone else, including students. I think that cell-phone usage at passing periods and lunch time would improve student morality about school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
