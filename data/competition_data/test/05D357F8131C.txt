Dear State Senator,

After experiencing the dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote in 2000 I realized that the Electoral College is an old fashioned and unfair voting system for our next presidents. The vote of all United States citizens should be taken account but with each state only getting a single vote it is highly inethical for a state with 500,000 voters like Wyoming and a state with 35 million voters like California having the same amount of votes.

The candidates who of course want to win will want to spend there time campaigning in states they think they have a chance of winning over but what about states that they do not think will vote for them? States like South Carolina and Rhode Island during the 2000 campaign didn't even see the candidates at all. This all because of the winner take all system established in the Electoral College.

There are people who still support the electoral college but on what end? They say it has a more certainty of outcome but there have been past cases where the electoral college almost hit a tie. In my opinon the odds of defult outcome in Electoral College is the same as the odds there would be in popular vote for the United States

Past presidents like Bod Dole, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter even agreed to destory the Electoral College. If even presidents want to abolish the Electoral College then what is stopping us from doing so. It's time we make a change to this irrational way of voting and start valuing the opinons of each United States citizen. The only way to do this is to start having direct elections and stop using the Electoral College way of voting. I am positive that this will have a positive affect on how people look up to the government because it will finally make them feel that the government values there opinons.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
