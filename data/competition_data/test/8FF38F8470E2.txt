Dear , Principal

TEACHER_NAME

If you would like to change the school policy that everyone must have a C average to a B average to compete in sports or other activities . I don't like it. I think a B average is to high some kids will try their best but cant make it ,and if its for sports that's outrageous because not everyone can make a B average just to play sports. That also means that they'll have more to do and less time to sleep because they'll have to go to their after school activity and still have to go home and do home work when they already are tired. Also they might have chores to d at home and with homework , sports, and the chores they have to focus on they'll be tired a lot .

A B average is to much for sports when the common average in the united states is a C average.

A C average is okay because they are not failing but can do a little more but they also have to think about sports because just like education, sports can help u be successful in life to.

Well to me and a lot of other students a B average is to much to play sports and it can be a little hard on the students to keep their grade up that high and still have to worry about sports on the other hand. That's my argument on why the that there should only be a C average. and i hope that you'll change your mind on the policy change.
