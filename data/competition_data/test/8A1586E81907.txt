You can tell that the author has a sweet spot for our neighboring planet, Venus. He starts off the paper by stating some facts about Venus and how it's super close to us at times and that Venus and Earth share some traits such as their size and rocky surface. He then goes on and states that we have done our fair share of exploring in Venus, but that it just wasn't good enough because the robots don't last very long in Venus due to its hard conditions such as their acid rain, extremely warm temperature and their atmospheric pressure. After all this though NASA still wants and is finding a way to get back over at Venus and the author does a very good job at describing their plans.

NASA is thinkning about creating a robot that could take on the pressure and last a good 3 weeks but the catch is that it will have to be over the skies of Venus, just like how jet pilets go above storms to get to places. This is a good idea to an extend though. If we really wanna see what Venus truely has to offer we need to explore it at its roots, descibes the author, and I can't help but agree with him. Sure we can learn from robots but it's better to get a hand on view of things, but with Venus conditions it seems like sending humans over might not be such a good idea. The author knows this too but he doesn't seem to quit because in pragraph 8 he says "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."

Just from hearing that makes me agree with him and a good example I thought of is like riding a bike. It's scary the first time you ride one and you are 99% granted that you are going to fall down but does that stop you from riding it? Of course it doesn't, you get back on until it gets to the point where you don't have to think about doing it, you just do it. Yes I understand that it's more complex then that but I agree with the author by us not beling limit because of fear and danger, we could and will find a way to explore not just Venus but also the other planets in our solar system and possibly, even farther.
