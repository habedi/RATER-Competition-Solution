It is no secret that human society has shown significant developments in technology in the past 10-20 years through innovations such as the smart phone and the tablet. With this level of complex technology, anyone can be virtually anywhere and talk to anyone in the world, leading to society being more connected than ever. To take advantage of this development in technology, some schools have provided the opportunity for students to attend classes from their own homes through online means or a video conference. While this idea is well meaning, and has obvious advantages, in the long run, students would not be able to benefit from attending classes at home because they lose their chance to build planning skills such, and there is no guarantee that the technology used will be consistent in its usage for this situation.

In a school environment, the distance between the school and a student's house can vary from student to student. This means that students need to plan accordingly on how they arrive to school on time so that they can be ready for the class period. If a student were to attend classes digitally, this factor is removed since students can just turn on their devices to immediately enter their classes. For some, this could be considered a significant convenience, and it can help those who don't have a direct method of transportation to school; however, for those already have their methods of reaching school on time, the extra convenience would be equal to "taking the easy way out". If students were to choose to attend classes through online means or video conference, then they lose their chance to build their planning skills that can help them once said students enter the workforce. While an argument could be made that there are more companies that present similar ideas, it has not reached the point where it is a near necessity, and that convenience will not always be there for employees in the future. While the short-term effects of attending school electronically are appealing, the long-term effects are more damaging to students in the future.

As stated previously, the current developments in technology allow for students to electronically attend classes; however, the quality of the online connection between the student's location and the school's location could end up being inconsistent. If the distance between the two locations is significant enough, then there is a possibility that technological issues could frequently pop up during a class lecture. Some of these issues range from buffering, to lagging, to choppy audio, and even complete disconnection. This is only emphasized even further when the rest of the school technology is taken into consideration. With schools utilizing technology more and more in the classroom, the number of people connected to one Wi-Fi location has increased, which leads to issues in online connection. While this is not an issue for students in their own home, the online connection on the school side would lead to the technological issues that were previously stated. However, this is only taking the video conference method into consideration. If the student were to take classes online, then any problems that can apply to any website would apply in this situation, meaning that numerous problems could show up that could hinder the students' learning opportunities such as the website crashing. Overall, there is a plethora of uncontrollable and inconsistent variables that would turn online classes and video conferencing into something that is less beneficial and more frustrating.

On the surface, online classes and video conferencing seems like a golden opportunity to allow students to learn when they don't have the best conditions to be in their classes, and in certain situations, that is true for some students. However, once long-term effects are analyzed, the cracks in the idea begin to show, and they would only grow bigger as time goes by and the students grow up. Eventually, important life skills are not developed properly, leading to struggle in the workforce, and a multitude of problems regarding the technology would become more of a nuisance to handle than it is a convenience. Unfortunately, with the increase in the usage of advanced technology, this type of learning will become more common in schools, and while there are benefits, new problems will surface that need attention.
