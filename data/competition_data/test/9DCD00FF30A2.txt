Dear Principal,

I think students should be allowed to have their cell phones at school.

it would be okay if students used them during their free time at school.

If there is only a school phone it could lead to problems with only one phone available.

Students should have their phones so that if there's an emergency they will be able to call their parents or the police.

It would be okay for students to have cell phones at school but as long as its not during class time , only during free time.

It could be good idea for students to have a cell phone at school.

If a student would get caught using a cell phone in class it should be confiscated.

So cell phones could be a good and bad idea but, students should be allowed to have their cell phones at school.

Our generation relies on technology to get news and to stay in touch with others.

So, i hope you decide and pick policy 1 so the students can bring their cell phones to school.
