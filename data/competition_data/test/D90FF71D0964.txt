Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that school activities and sports are very important part of every day student life. If you take away these activities than it will negatively affect many students. These activities provide students with new learning experiences that are very important to some of these students. Taking them away will not help grades at all.

At one point or another, almost every student has gone to one of these school activities or sports. Taking away these after school activities will affect the students in copious ways like there health. Many student s are in clubs after school so that they can easily hang out and have something to do. If they don't have something to do after school besides homework, and they probably won't study, they might try to do something extreme. There are many skateboarders in out school and most of them are in a club regulated by the school to make sure they don't do something too hard, without this guidance many will just try and do all the hardest tricks first. Also since the school does not have an eye on them they could be attacked. The crime rate is rapidly increasing meaning that our student are more likely to be attacked or commit crimes.

On the news a while back there was a story of some kid whose school would not let him go to after school activities because he forgot his homework a couple of times. This made him outraged and every day he was bored. Later on that year he became angry with his teachers because he could not go back to after school activities. One of the local gangs then recruited him and his grades plummeted even more and he started to smash mailboxes and other crimes. When he was charged for these things he said that it was his school's fault because he could not go to the after school activities.

If a student does poorly on his grades it should not mean that all of the after school activities should be stripped from them. There should be a compromise. Maybe instead of just getting there privileges just stripped from them they should get a warning. After getting a warning if there grades do start to improve they are free to go, but if they continue to drop they should have to go after school at least two times a day to study to get back into the clubs. This would help students improve there grades and get back there normal privileges.

Principal TEACHER_NAME, please do not take away school activities and sports just because a student's grades drop. They should get a chance to redeem themselves. Also taking the activities right out from underneath them will leave them falling.
