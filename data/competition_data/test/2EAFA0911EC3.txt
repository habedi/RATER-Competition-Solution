Our principal at my school has edcided that he wants to make all students attend in at least one extracurricular activity. I do not agree with this statement, doing that would put more stress on kids as a whole. If he did add that rule than it would either add time to school, or make the rest of the classes shorter so they can fit it in. Some kids also do not enjoy any of the options there would be, so that would just make te kid do a class he doesnt need or want to do.

Stress is a thing that kids already have to deal with because of other classes that they already have in school. Adding an extra class or activity they have to do could either mess them up mentaly or mess up their schedule outside of school. Some kids have killed them self because of school and school only, adding that extra class would really not be good for the kids brain.

Another issu would be adding time or taking time out of school. If the class they took was in school they would have to shorten their other classes to fit it in or even leave a class they are already in. If their activity is outside of school that means that they would have to stay at school longer after school is over. That yet again could mess up a kids schedule if they already had things to do when school was over.

Most of the kids would be bored out of there mind and just not enjoy the activity what so ever. Lets say a kids parentforced them to join chess club, that kid at first liked chess when he was learning it but when he knew all of the rules he didnt like it and it got boring. If there was an option to change clubs if they added this rule then he could just leave it. There is still a chance though that he didnt like any of the other clubs or couldnt do any other clubs so if that happens, he is stcuk in a boring club.

Money would also be an issue with this rule. Not only would some kids not have money to buy equipment they need for the club the school could also at a time not have enough money for the club. Lets say that happened, that means that club either gets shut down or is garbage because they dont even have the budget to make it happen. Just like i said before even if the school did have the money some of the kids would not be able to buy equipment which would mean they cant do that club and would be stuck in a different one that they may not like.

Another issue is having to build things for a new club. Now this probably would not happen but there is still a chance that it would, If they added a volley ball club and they didnt have a volley ball net or volley balls than they would have to build a net or maybe even a new gym for the club. Here is where another issu comes in and that is the budget, you need money to order new equipment. No equipment means no club no club means that the kids who wanted to do this club cannot do it and they have to choose a different one that they may not like or takes time after school which messes up there schedule for things out side of school.

Now if you do not get my point for all of the things i just said, All of my issues connect to one and other. Adding this to the school would just make the school worse and cause more issues than the school already has. In my opinion it is pointless to add it and would just mess up the whole flow of school that they already had, and to be honest the school board would probably not approve this addition so it was overall just a dumb idea that the principal had. Thats all i have to say, i hope you enjoyed this response.
