why would anybody want to be in a car that controls itself? What if the car breaks down in the middle of now where. What if a hacker hacks the car and drives you off a cliff or into a ocean? What if the car crashes and will not allow you to get out of the car before it blows up? Driverless cars are dangerous because you dont know what will happen once you're in a machines control.

Smart cars are not able to pull in or out of driveways, dealing with traffic, working their way through roadwork or even an accidents. Driving in and out a driveway is easy but a smart car is unable to do such a thing. A smart car has techology that i is a spinning sensor on the top called Dubbed LIDAR. that uses lasers to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars around it. So it should be able to pull in and out of driveways and also be able to coraperate in traffic.

Another example is what is a super smart hacker or terrorist hacks into the smart cars system and start creating crashes. Even if the Google cofounder Sergey creates a safe enough password someone will find a way to crack the code. There are lives at steak with these driverless cars. What if someone had a enemy decides to hack into their car, and drives them off a cliff. who will be responsable Google cofounder Sercey.

in conclusion driverless smart cars are dangerous they are just trying to make the work high tech and easy. And when i say easy i meant less work for man kind and our future. We should just leave driverless smart cars to the television and movies.
