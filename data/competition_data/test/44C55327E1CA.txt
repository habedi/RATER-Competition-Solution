The author does not support this claim well enough. In the passages, the author goes on about the many problems that are associated with exploring Venus. Most of the problems the author has listed are fatal to humans, making it impossible to achieve what the author obviously wants; to examine Venus throughly for humans to have enough information to finally inhabit the hot planet. Unfortunately for the author, many people would agree that this article does not support the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the obvious dangers well enough.

There are many problems stated in the article (paragraph 3) on why Venus is a very dangerous planet to explore. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system, even though the planet Mercury is far closer to the sun. The burning hot planet is also covered in 97 percent carbon dioxide, a lethal gas for living creatures on Earth, very much including humans. The planet's surface is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric is 90 times greater than Earth's. No human or any other living creature can survive in these conditions, not even with the technology we have today. The author adds that the planet's weather and physical conditions is quite capricious; volcano eruptions every now and then, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning attacks on the probes Nasa sends to Venus does not help the author's beliefs either. No spaceship has touched the planet in 3 decades, making the planet even more mysterious because of the changes that could have started during those 3 long decades.

The author then tries to turn the bad news around with what most would call, 'wishful thinking'. The article shows information of how Nasa has an idea of how they could get to Venus without immediatley dying and wasting resources. Of course, it is all but an idea. A theory, that cannot be tested accurately, neither without huge costs. The article also states of researchers who develop physically capable computers that might have a better chance of lasting longer on Venus with enough time to collect needed information. The truth of the matter is, these solutions are all just fantasies; ideas that we wish could be acted upon, but the world is far too complicated for that to happen so easily.

Human curiosity can do wonders for the world. That is not to be compared to miracles however, because that is what's needed to achieve the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. Human's in general are capricious creatures, very much like Venus itself. We strive to learn and gain control of another planet, when the results clearly show that we cannot even take care of our own.

While the author is a positive thinker, their idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit is laughable. The article does not do well enough, or maybe at all, to convince that Venus is a worthy pursuit. There is too many problems with the idea, and too many factors to be played out, and not enough good solutions to help support the idea. Although we cannot say that the idea is unacheivable, with the evidence and solutions stated in the article, it canot happen with those proofs alone.
