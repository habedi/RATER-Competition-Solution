The Seagoing Cowboys is a part of a group that is called

UNRRA it helps people and animals after the war. the reason you should join is that you are helping people and it is cool to go see other places and different like the Acropolis in Greece and china and europe. there are some ups and downs but it is worth it to see where you can go sometimes you will have to work nights watching the animals every hour of the night you will have to be care full because the dangers of the sea is different than it is on a farm.

It is alot of fun the animals keep you busy and there are games you can play games like boxing,base ball,table tennis,and tournaments on the way over to china or europe or where ever your going they always had fun.
