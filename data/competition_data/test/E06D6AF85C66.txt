Venus is the second planet from the sun, and one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. By some this planet is called the "Evening Star'' because of how bright it is. This planet is known as Earth's twin, because its the closest planet to Earth in size and density. Often times the closest planet to Earth if it wasnt for the way Mars orbited. There is alot about Venus that people don't know about. Through the good in this planet it's also dangerous.

Venus has the hottest suface tempature of any planet on the solar syatem, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Knowing what the atmosphere is like up there makes it harder for people in Nasa. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, as it states in paragraph 2. Every since then no aircraft has touched Venus in almost 3 decades. This planets surface average tempature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 90 times greater than Earths surface. Venus's atmosphere is not just hot it also contains up to 97 percent carbon dioxide which is bad for your lungs.

Despite the dangers scientist are looking for new ways to explor this planet. Nasa has been trying to look for new ways but also some old ways from World War 2 that they could improve on. As they were looking for different ways they came up with the idea to hover over the plant so they could see it scloser, and that would allow humans to survive up to 170 degree weather. Through our the dangers and the beauty of this planet, scientist wont stop until they explorer this star.
