Dear, principal

I am writing this letter to you to tell why community service is required to every student here at are school. Community service can help use later on in school . Like if you wont to go to college you have to have community service be done . It might help the planet to it will make us be more green . That is why i am writing this letter to you .

Community service can help you very much in school for you. 1 its good for a college aplucation, 2 it helps if you clean up your school.

Being green once you have done community service you will know its good to be keeping the planet healthy. Making a group and be in the community service . Doing community service leads on to good things. It could lead on helping others not just sitting at home and doing nothing .

Community service may inspier someone in life when there all grown up they might wont to a big really big green house and bring kids from all over the world and see what community service can do to you. like I said community service and lead to good things in life and education that's why we should perform community service .
