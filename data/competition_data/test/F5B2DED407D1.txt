Summer, A wonderful season to spend time with family and friends. when students think about summer we want to relax, go to the mall, and do other events but once we realizes that we have a summer project, most of the time it's notices last minute so knowing student it won't get done. My mother once said " If you want something done then get it done and show them you're capable". Since then this saying stuck in my head so it should be student-designed because it can show the skills that they have, it tells the teacher that they understand the project, and students can fun with the project in the short time they have to do it.

Firstly, Every student has their different ways of do things and skills are one of them because by students designing the project it gives students the try to proof them self. All students are talented in their own way. Some students show their skills of they what they know how to do and how they expess it but one thing about skills students enjoy doing them and they can do what they most time.

Secondly, By students designing the project; it tell the teacher that they understand because it's important for the students to key points about project and it shows the teacher that they didn't care about it or they just didn't understand so when school start again the teacher know their strong and weakness so as the teacher they can help the students and guide on the right path.

Finally, In conclusion by students designing they can enjoy doing their project and happy to finish it the frist week they get it and continue enjoying their summer vacation while they still can and a good way for student to expess them self in their work to show the teacher a little bit their up coming student for the next year.
