Dear principle,

I do not think that you should require kids to do community service.

I believe that forcing kids to do that will not make them feel good about what they are doing.

Make them realize that they would want help if it were them that was in need.

Also, they should not have to do community service because it will cause fights and gangs to form.

So, with that said, I believe that you should not require kids to do any community service.

I do not think that you should require kids to do community service because it will not allow the kids to feel good about what they are doing.

It will also not allow them to realize that they are making someone else no that people are willing to help them.

This will make others feel bad that they are not helping others.

Then they will start doing community service and soon the school will be doing it on their own without you forcing them to do it.

So you should not make them do community service if they don't want to and make them want to do it on their own.

Another reason is that if they don't want to than they don't have to.

If you force them to do it than it will cause fights in the school.

Their will be gangs and they will always be fighting and it will be all because you wanted them to do some community service.

Nobody will be safe and the school will have to be shut down because their are not enough kids in school because you suspended or expelled them.

If you do make kids do community service, than you will be in trouble because a bunch of kids will be all screw you principle.

So, if you do make kids do community service, than you and the school will be in trouble.

Some people might think that it is a good idea because it will make kids feel good about themselves.

And that they will start doing community service on their own.

But I say, if they like it so much, than you should never have had to make them do it in the first place.

Many kids already do community service on their own and you should not have to force us to do it.

So even though it is kind of a good idea, kids will still get mad and maybe even threaten you.

Kids should not have to do community service if they don't want to.

They should be able to do it on their own and feel good about what they just did.

It will cause fights and gangs to come after you and each other.

It will cause nothing but fights in the school.

All in all, I think that you are wrong and you should not force us to do community service.

Sincerely, a student
