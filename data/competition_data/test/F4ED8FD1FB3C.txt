I will be writing about why you should paticipate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will include details from the story. Also reasons to join the program. the last thing i will include is examples from the text.

My frist reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is just to experiance new things. You should not be on your phone all day doing nothing. Get up and at least try to have a little bit of fun. if you have never been there or even heard of it how do you know it is going to be boring. You never know until you drop your phone and actually join. You might end up having some fun.

A second reason is well look what Luke Bomberger did. He joined 44 nations to form unrra (the united nations relief and rehabilitation). UNRRA took care of horses, young cows, and mules that wers shipped overseas. Wouldnt you want to spend your days with nice and loving animal that wont hurt you. You never know, if no one joins Seagoing Cowboys then maybe there could have been animals who were in dangered, or might be extinct. I think that animal are really fun to hang out with.

The last and final reason is you dont just take care of animals but you help the places that were dastroyed because of world war II. It would be great if you actually got to see where many people were fighting, got killed, injured, or much more in world war II. Just like Luke in the story, you can also go to may places that he went like new orleans, or greece. This is your oppertunity to visit beautiful places that you have never been to before. You could also meet new people.

To summarize everything up those are some reasons why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. You just never know until you try it out.
