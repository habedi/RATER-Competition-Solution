I think that policy number one is the best. first reason, you miss your bus and you forget your mom, dad, and your home phone number, second your mom or dad work during the day.

so you miss your bus and you forget you moms or dads number and you cant call them, and you don't know that they have a phone book or something like that, and it is way cooled out side so that is a down fall to not having cell phones at school.

Your mom and dad work during the day and you only remember one of there numbers and that number is your dads and he works during the day and cant pike you up then what do you do just wait until you remember your moms number or something or wait until you can get picked up, and what if you have a family vacation you have to pack for and then you miss the flight to Hawaii and then you just wasted like four thousand dollars on a flight because you don't have a cell phone that has a contact list to help you remember.

So I personally think that we should be aloud at the school for the reasons I have stated. Would you wont to waste two/four thousand dollars because you son or daughter cant have a cell phone at school.
