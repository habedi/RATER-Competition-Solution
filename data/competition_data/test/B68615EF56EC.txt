I think that policy 1 sounds like a good idea but i would suggest a tip to having your phone on vibrate. Now you have to think is having a cell phone that bad as long as it off during your classes to stop causes of distraction. A majority of kids who have a cell phone use it during school regardless if it's restrictive or not. So allowing it in school couldn't make it any worse because to have to stop a class to take a phone away or even arguing with a kid to see if they were using it or not would make it stop most likely. They would be able to check or take a phone call out of class instead of in a class room were kids are trying to learn. Policy 2 on the other hand would make things worse because some kids parents and single parents work late and when they come home with no phone or maybe even key incase of a emergency.
