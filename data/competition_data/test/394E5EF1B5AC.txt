98.7% of people don't want to participate in school activities because in their minds, a little voice is telling them, "Why do school activities when there is no point in them?" Shut that voice off and think about if school activities would actually help you in school. I strongly agree about students participating in at least one hobby because you can be helping your school out and the other people around you. Participating in a school activityÂ can help you get a more healthier mind, raise money for your school, and help you with teamwork skills.

First of all, having a clean mind makes your body feel healthy and energized. It can make you feel less overwhelmed and help you think about other important things. School activities can help a lot with dreadful and depressed times, that is why it is a great idea to participate and have a cleaner mind. It can help with a lot of your problems and can take your mind off of a lot of things.

Therefore, participating for your school can help them raise money. The money they raise can help families in need for shelter, clothes, food, or anything they need to survive. The money can also go to book stores, clothes stores, shoes stores, toy stores, and anything families would be thrilled to have. It can put a smile on your face helping the families in need.

Lastly, partnership is a great way to fit in, it can help you make lots of new friends and explore the meaning of true teamwork. Teamwork is a good way of being respectful, for an example, if your having trouble on a sport or different hobby, someone could step in and lend you a helping hand. Working together on sports, projects, and different types of hobbies, can make a lot of things easier for you. Making new friends helps you have a fun time and makes your life a lot better.

In conclusion, having a cleaner mind, helping families in need, and having partnership skills are all great ways why you should participate in school activities. It can make you feel amazing inside when you help other people around you. Helping out your school can actually be a good feeling, it gives you a positive mind set and can help you for your future. Before telling yourself " There is no point in school activities," think about how it can help you, families, friends and your school.
