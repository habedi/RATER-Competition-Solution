That would not be fair to us students. Maybe kids are struggling because they don't get the material. they might need a tutor to help with that subject, because maybe sports are there lives like it is for me, it probably keeps them out of trouble, and if they cant get an B average they wont be able to play sports so they'll get trouble. keeping it at a c average will help them stay in sports.

For me sports help me a lot it pushes me to get good greads to stay in sports and it keeps me out of trouble because I am so caught up in school and in sports that i will have no time to get my self in to trouble, but maybe for other students it isn't like that they probably don't get the material and just need a little more help like a touter, an easier class or just need the material to be explained a little more maybe they just need a little extra help.

i think if u keep the C average it would be easier for the kids who love sports but need help in school to stay in sports and its not cool to not be able to stay in sports because they don't get the material, that's how it was for me in 7th gread i got below a c average and couldn't play sports. That was not fun, not one bit. the students at our school just need a little more help to keep their grade average at a c average and if you don't see any improvement in the students greads at our school then maybe you might have to enforce that rule.

maybe that will push the subnets to work harder to get their greads up to stay in sports if they really want to be in sports, and that's how i see this we just need a little more help that's it.
