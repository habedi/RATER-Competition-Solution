The issue with extracurricular activities

Should all students participate in at least one extra curricular activity? No, the principal's new rule that makes students participate in at least one extra curricular activity is ridiculous. First of all, for many students it is not in their budget to stay after school, they just can not afford it. Second is, a lot of students have responsibilities or struggles at home they have to take care of, and can not simply stay after school, even if it is just for an hour. The principle should rethink his decisions and not make this a rule at our school.

Many students at our school aren't as fortunate as others, and struggle to make ends meet. Their only rides to and from school could be the school bus because their families don't have a good car, so they would have to go through finding someone else to drive them, which can be very difficult sometimes. For the kids whose families do have cars, that could mean that their parents have to take time of of work to pick up and drive home their kids. The more time their parents have to take off work to pick up them from clubs and sports, the less money they could have the opportunity to make for their family.

Some students attending our school have things that are out of their control that they need to get done right after school, like homework. Other students have family struggles outside of school, such as their parents being split up and then having to rely on only one parent to take care of them at that specific time. When a student only has one parent taking care of them at a specific time, they may not have a choice but to go home after school on the bus because the parent taking care of them has be at work at that time. Some students may also have a lot of homework that they can not get done if they go to a club or sport after school. The principal did not make it clear about if club sports counted as an extracurricular activities. Many students participate in club sports, and if they are made to stay after school in a school club, they could miss a practice or game. Students might also have a long list of chores to do when they get home and a club could get in the way of that.

So should students be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity? No, they should be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity. If they get forced to participate in an extracurricular activity their normal, everyday lives could be disrupted, and some students just can not do a club or sport at all due to things happening at home. If we put this rule into place, the school would quickly turn into a disaster of confused and upset kids.
