Cars will always remain useful and important because it is one of the best ways of transportation and everything is centered around them. Even though they are causing an obsurd amount of pollution. This can be reduced if cities start making changes such as repairing broken hazardous sidewalks, relocating attractions like malls, restaurants and gyms closer to the towns cars would be used drastically less. Some places in the world have already began making these changes and have even went as far as making a whole "car-free" day.

In europe passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and it will continue to rise unless cars begin to be used less frequently. If every city builds their stores and attractions closer to the communities instead of on the "outskirts" of towns then there would be no need to use a car. Everyday an increasing amount of people ride their bikes to their job, out to eat etc. Weather it be for health and excersise or just the preferred mode of transportation it is probably the best alternative to a car due to how quick a bike is.

An upscale community of about 5,500 residents in Germany has gone ahead and began making remarkable changes toward limiting car use. In this community they have basically made the streets free of cars. Parking in the street, driveways, and home garages are banned you can only park in a parking garage which they have placed around the town or you can buy a space for $40,000 that includes a home of course. People that live in this enviroment actually prefer it and some have even said "im much happier this way" as opposed to using cars in the traffic jammed streets all the time.

Another city which has began to pave the path for future designs is Bogota. Every year for the past 3 years the capitol of Columbia has banned all cars for a day in attempt to promote and popularize alternative of transportation and reduce economic problems like smog. People in the city love this idea and almost all participate rain or shine. Since they have this great idea many parks and sports centers have resulted from it and a lot of sidewalks have been re-paved.

Finally, All people should make an attempt to better their cities and speak out to people who can make it happen. Cars are not the future, they are causing many bad things to happen and should be used much less frequently. Places all over the world are realizing this and are already participating in the reduced use of cars.       Â
