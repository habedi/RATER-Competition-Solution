Dear Principle,

This is one of your hundreds of students at the school. I asking about why students should be doing community service when they have lots of other thing to do. They should not have to do community service unless they want to. For example students who participate in sports don't have time with community service. On the other hand, some students like to do community service because they have nothing to do. I like to do community service from time to time but, I think you should ask the students if they want to perform community service. So my decision is, that you should ask the students before making them do community service. Let me ask you this, what would you do? I'm just saying. Let me just say one more thing, would you like to perform community service and waste your valuable time? So that's all I have to say.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
