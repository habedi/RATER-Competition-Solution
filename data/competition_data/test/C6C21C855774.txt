Most students would love to stay at home instead of going to school to complete their schoolwork. However, having to do work for school at home can turn into a disaster easily if a student gets lazy. Even though some say that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it gives them more flexibility, students would not benefit from distance learning because they would be less socially active and aware, have undeveloped time-management skills, and find it hard to motivate themselves to get their work done while being home alone.

First, students will most likely be less socially active and aware. If they do not go to school every day, a very likely circumstance is that they will not see their friends every day either. Not seeing and interacting with their friends could make them depressed or even feel left out if they happen to be the only one not at school. Next, students who are doing online school do not experience and learn to handle all types of people. In comparison, every day at school students have new experiences with different people that students participating in distance learning would not have. These experiences build character and social skills needed for life. Also, students never learn how to control their own bad habits for the sake of being polite to other people if they sit at home by themselves all day. In conclusion, if distance learning is accepted, students will become more antisocial and socially awkward.

Next, students attending regular school have chances all day to practice time-management skills, unlike students who participate in online school. Students who are in distance learning have all day to complete their work. If no activities or scheduled meetings exist, the need to manage work disappears. Also, no end-of-class deadlines exist, which means that students in online school never learn how to finish an assignment in a limited amount of time in a classroom full of other students. Failing to practice completing work with a time limit in an environment that could have distractions would not set students up to succeed in college. Lastly, students who go to online schoolÂ never have to go in early before class to talk to a teacher about work they do not understand. Since this activity might be needed in college, smart students are practicing it now. Unfortunately, distance learning students do not get a chance to practice this habit due to never being at school. By not practicing going to school early, they will never know how to get their work done early the night before in order to wake up early while still maintaining the right amount of sleep. In conclusion, attending online school would not fulfill a student's need to practice their time-management skills.

Lastly, it would be hard to gather enough motivation to get all the work done as an online school student. Although they have all day, procrastination might arise and keep them from starting their work until that night, even though they had been doing nothing the whole day. All procrastination does is grow and spiral, so a student might even push back their work by days because they feel like they have plenty of time. If they went to school, they would have assignments due the next day and a teacher to answer to if the work did not get completed. Also, online school lacks a teacher sitting right in front of them and instructing them on what to do and when to do it. Everyone feels more motivated when an adult is telling them what they need to do by a certain date. Moreover, if the online teacher said the work was optional, the online students might not have a reason to complete the work. They might feel like because they never see the teacher, the teacher would not ask them about the assignment. This occurrence will eventually start to hurt the students because they will end up with less practice and might not do as well on the assessment. In conclusion, staying at home all day instead of going to school makes it very hard to find motivation and avoid procrastination and excuses.

In conclusion, online school will end up hurting students because they will not be as social, not have as many chances to practice their time-management skills, and have trouble motivating themselves to accomplish their work. If students decided to go to online school, they would all be bored and unmotivated. To stop this change from occurring, encourage students to physically go to school and tell them how much fun it will be to be around friends all day.
