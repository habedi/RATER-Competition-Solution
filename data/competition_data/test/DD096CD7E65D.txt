Let me explain to my fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage. The reason I say this because In German Suburb, Life goes on without cars. Paris bans due to smog. And Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.

In German they dont really care for cars " Street parking, dirveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new districton the outskirt of Freiburg, near the french and Swiss borders." there roads and sidewalks are mainly free they dont to many cars in German. The only people that was really allowed to have cars were car owners, but but there were ony 2 places to park "Large garages at the edge of the development that casted $40,000 along with a home." Some people felt like they were always tense when they had a car, they like not having a car so they wouldn't have to pay for the high gas they need for their gas tank. They felt like walking was way better, it was an exercise and it was more calming then being stuck in traffic.

Paris bans driving because to many people are getting smoggeled."After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." If they were caught driving they would be getting a fine a really big fine. "Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters, 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fines." People wasnt taking their car previliges being taking to well they felt like they needed their cars to get to point A to point Z. But they understood why they could drive their cars they knew it was for their own safty "Well atleast some knew it was."

Inconclusion now My fellow citizens Know how people felt about the advantages of limiting car usage.
