Some schools require students to complete summer projects in order for students to continue learning during their break; these projects, however, should be designed by students. Instead of sitting in a boring room and having no say in planning a project, students should plan them themselves. Allowing students to design their own summer projects makes projects more interesting and enjoyable.

Allowing students to plan their own projects gives the students more freedom to use their creativity. When students plan their own projects, students have the opportunity to decide what they want their projects to be. For example, some students may want to their project to be a science fair. If they had the freedom to plan out their science fair, they would be in control; which would allow them be able to plan about what each person could present at the science fair or even when the science fair will take place. In turn, it could allow students to be creative and enjoy themselves. Allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to decide for themselves.

While allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to express their creativity, it also shows that they are responsible. When they design their own projects, they show that they are able to make responsible decisions. For example, the students that wanted their project to be a science fair might have to consider where the science fair will take place and what type of concessions will be there. These are the decisions that the students will think about when they plan there science fair, and will result in proving their critical thinking skills and responsible decision-making. When students have the ability to plan out their own projects, they can be responsible enough to make good and smart decisions.

However, there are those who disagree and state that students should not plan their own projects because there would be too much responsibility for the students to handle; there would also be too much freedom and students can take a negative advantage or abuse that freedom. On the contrary, the students would not have too much responsibility due to there being a large body of students pitching in ideas. As a result, there would not be too much responsibility on only one student or a small section of students. Another reason why these statements are false is because with a large amount of freedom, student can be a lot more creative when designing projects.

In conclusion, students who participate in summer projects, that is required by school, should be able to plan these projects themselves. Eventhough some may disagree, their statements are false. If more summer projects were designed by students instead of teachers, more students would enjoy and appreciate summer projects a lot more.
