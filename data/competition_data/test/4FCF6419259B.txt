You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It helps make countries that are in ruins recover their food supplies, animals, and more. You can use this program as something less extreme than war for your service. The trips are fun expieriences.

When you are on the trips, you have plenty of time for sightseeing. You benefit a lot from being a Seagoing Cowboy. If you get bored, you wont. Taking care of the animals will keep you busy.

The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Sometimes it can be a dangeous job though. But, it is mostly fun. After the animals were unloaded, everyone played games like baseball and such.

The games also help pass time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure. It opened up the world to me. It will make you more aware of other people's needs.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity. And, I hope you take it.
