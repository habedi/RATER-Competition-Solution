The Face on Mars is very interesting. For many years people have thought it was aliend created. But our photographs clearly show the Face on Mars is not alien created because we have the best cameras we could get, but in 1998 they had the best cameras they could get but they were very weak, and the Face is a natural landform.

In 1998 the cameras they had were very weak they weren't like are cameras today. They are only fourty three meters per pixel which is not a lot. The cameras also captured shadows, so that interfeared with the picture and could make it look like something else. Also the cameras were weak and not very strong.

The Face on Mars is also just a natural landform, formed by the winds and rocks and the planet moving. It's also a big rock which is in the shape of an oval which is probably why people think it was alien created. Also the shadows were there because of how weak the cameras were in 1998. The landform the rock formation is called is a mesa.

Also in 2001 we had way better cameras than in 1998. Are cameras were stronger. They also had less pixels per frame. The pixels per frame were 1.56 which is great. The camera also zoomed in and could see the Face on Mars close up. The camera also took a nice clear photo rather than the one in 1998.

Because our photographs show you that the Face on Mars is a mesa. We concluded that it is not an alien created face. The image can clearly show you how it looks and that there is no face at all.
