Dear Principal,

I think it would be a good idea to let students bring their phones to school but only let them use their cell phones at lunch and other free periods. This is a good idea for many reasons including they can check with parents about the rest of the day, they can write down in their phones what assignments they have and notes about it.

If students where allowed to have cell phones in school they would be able to check with their parents about their after school schedule. For example say the student has a younger sibling they need to pick up but their parent forgot to tell them then if the student had a phone they could learn about the task and know they had to do it. That is just one reason why it is a good idea for students to be allowed to have cell phones in school.

Also if a student forgets thing easily they can write down a assignment on their phones to remember it after school. This can help raise students grades and therefore giving the student more self esteem and more chances to succeed in life. Would you deny a student their future?

Some people might say that students would use their phones in class and that would distract them from learning. But this is a simple problem to fix. you could make a rule saying that if anyone is caught using their phones in class that they get a detention. and if a teacher can spot someone chewing gum then they can spot someone on a phone.

So as you can see letting students have phones during school but only letting them use it during free periods is a great idea. It is a great idea because parents could inform student about their after school schedule and students could write down assignments after class on their phones. And if this turns out to be a bad idea you could always take away the rule.
