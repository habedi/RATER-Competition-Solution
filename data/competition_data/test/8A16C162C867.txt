Dear principle

Students should be able to have there phones at school. the reason why is because phones bring joy to anyone at school. Also instead of having no control you'll some control over them because you know what they say '' if you can't beat them join them". Also if some one gets there phone stolen its not really your fault they chose to have them out you weren't telling them to have it out. Another reason is that it will stop kids from texting in class because they've texted enough outside. this will make every ones life easer. I believe that since you give them the opportunity they will do so. also it will improve friendship because the shy people will no longer be shy and they will spread there wings and fly. What is also good about is that if there is an emergency every student can get help. another thing is that a phone has basic needs like calculators so it will serve as a helping hand. But one thing is needed to be done it is that phones needed to be collected before a test because that can be a contributing factor to grades. So in conclusion policy one should be accepted. Not policy two because kids are even more likely to bring phones because they want to disobey you. That is why policy two should be used.
