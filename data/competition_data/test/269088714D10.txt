Extracurricular's are very important for the growth of young individuals for so many reasons such as, teaching important values including teamwork, it can show students interests that they didnt know they had, and certain ones could put kids in different learning environments and make new friends.

One main reason that extracurricular's are so important is that they can teach growing children the importance of teamwork. This quality is very sought after in the professional world and being taught as early as adolescence the importance of teamwork is very impactful. Another great thing about learning how to work in a team is that it's not only taught in sports, teamwork can be taught in so many other formats like student council, yearbook club , and so much more. These extracurricular's can also teach responsibility of being on a team and how your actions affect everyone around you an how not to be individualistic.

Extracurricular's can also help students find interests outside of the classroom. This give students the opportunity to find passion in subjects that aren't in school in clubs like

Rocketry Club, Clay Club, and Eco-Action Club . Extracurricular's give students more time to put into themselves and explore all of the possibilities that are in extracurricular'sÂ as well.

Extracurricular's can give some of the more soft-spoken students an opportunity to find a community that they can socialize in. These kids can also find friends with similar interests that are in the same clubs or activities. These give certain students an opening to feel more confident and less shy during school. Extracurriculars can give a kid a small social circle that they may have not had if it not have joined an extracurricular.

Extracurricular's are so important for a growing student and therefore should be mandatory.
