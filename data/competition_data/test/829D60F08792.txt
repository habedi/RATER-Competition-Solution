Dear Principal,

I think that you should require all students to do community service, even if its just for a couple of hours. I believe that the kids should care about their community and help clean it up so it can be a better place for the younger kids. I think that the kids should also tutor the other younger kids because someone probably had to tutor them when they were younger, so they should give back to the community by helping the younger kids.

Just imagine if you were one grade ahead of your younger brother or sister, you can't really tutor them because you don't know that much more than they do, so you would probably like for them to be tutored by an older, more intelligent person. That is why I believe that you, the principal, should assign every student community service. Besides, it wouldn't hurt them, it would actually keep them out of trouble.

Could you imagine if you were a parent and your child had a weak immune system and he or she had to walk to school? I mean, you would want his or her surroundings to be nice and clean so that they wouldn't get sick. Don't you want our neighborhood to be clean? So it would be very aiding if a few students cleaned up the neighborhood.

Sincerely,
