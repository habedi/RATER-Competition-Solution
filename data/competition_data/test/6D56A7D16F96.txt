I think that the technology to read the emotion expression of the students in the classroom is valueable. It can show how people really feel and waht types of emotions they have at that time. This can aslo help people when they are drawing pictures to see what moods they have in their pictures .Yes I think that this well be helpful this can help people in the further when they are making pictures and they want the picture to have a certain mood.

One good example that they use in the storie would have to be when they tell about the that the "Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy , 9 perecent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." I think that can come to good use like how do they know all of this form one picture. An how can this one 3-D computer do all of this on a picture . How can the computer tell the model of your face and how can they tell all 44 major muscles in in your body . They also tell how you can do is your self by looking in the mirror . An thy give you you the steps to try it out youself and what you need to do. I think that this computer is going to be good use for people thta studie pictures for a living it can tell them thing that they would not be able to see with there eyes. The storie tells about the muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus and what it dose to the picture . An you cant do this on your computer at home and that it wont be able to handle it .An your facial muscles not only expresses emotions.

In conclusion I think that this would be good to have in a class room setting. I thin that this would rely help people that want study this kind of thing in collage . An it would be as geat idea to put it in schools so that they can start when they are in school and it can help them if thats what they want to do they get done with school. I that this 3-D computer will come in good uses on other old pictuers to tell the mood in the pictures.
