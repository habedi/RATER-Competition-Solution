Dear TEACHER_NAME

How can this B average be taken care of?

I think what you have recommend is out of the question.

we as the students can hardly maintain a C average as it is.

I am here to speak up on this selfish idea.

first, many children have a hard time keeping up in class to have a b average just to play something that they desire to play. second, how can we keep up with sports home work and maintaining a b average.

last but not least, how we have a lot of things to worry about at home and then a another plate is on our shoulders. how can we do all this at once first, many children have a hard time keeping up in class to have a B average just to play a game they desire to play. I have a b in language arts that i trying to keep up with and, doing cheer leading is hard enough. how would you feel if some one told you that you have to do something that is difficult enough to maintain. trust me i trying my best with this new rule you just came up with. how can i do this with no help?

second , how can we keep up with sports homework and maintaining a B average. it not impossible its just unreasonable. if you think you can joggle each of the thing us kids are trying to do in our time you'll think oh they got us bet. think about the little things yall do to us waking up going to school doing class work go home do some home work and go to practice. this is a lot to do under a little amount of time now we have to maintain THIS UNREASONABLE task you have us trying to perform last but not least , we have lots of things to do and you putting to much on our shoulders. we try and try and try to met you adults needs but i guess it not working. we push our self's and complete your task now its time to complete our don't give us the B average idea it way out of our young minds let us stay with the C

average please thanks, STUDENT_NAME
