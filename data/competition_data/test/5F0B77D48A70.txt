Over 69.9% of our population today owns a cell phone. We use them to text, call and even play games. We can carry them around with us to where ever we go, but does that mean that we should be able to use them in the car? Would there be another way around using a cell phone while driving? Honestly, we shouldn't be able to handle a cell phone while operating a vehicle and here is why.

When you are driving, your attention should be focused on the road. A cell phone is considered a distraction because if something is going on in front of you, then you need to be able to pay attention to these little things to keep yourself safe. Abrupt stops, crashes, no turn signals, motorcycles, the drivers on the other sides of you and stop lights/signs are all examples of things you would have to keep your eyes on the road for. If your attention is somewhere else, then it will be extremely hard to catch situations that's going on in-front of you. Then, it becomes a huge hazard to you and others around you.

Statistics show that 24,000 people are injured every year because of cell phones. On top of that, 995 fatalities happen within a year because of the same reason, texting and driving. (cited: https://www. carinsurancecomparison. com/texting-while-driving-statistics/ ) . People are now more concerned about texting and driving than drunk driving; But is there a way to break the system?

There shouldn't be a way around texting and driving. Our phones now have a "DO NOT DISTURB" motion button while driving because its that hazardous. Our cars became Bluetooth to help texting and driving to be prevented so there shouldn't be a reason to pick up your phone as your driving. A way around is the wrong way because your taking a huge risk that can be avoided.

Texting and driving is fatal. If a vehicle can have its own fatality rate... then we shouldn't enhance the rate because of a text message that can definitely wait. Driving is an opportunity that was given to us for easier transportation, but if cell phones don't stop being used while driving... consequences will be enhanced and driving privileges will be taken away. So to stop the fatal/injured rate, we should let the text message not be responded so we don't have to have a first aid responder come to us for a mistake we could have prevented.
