I have been working with Nasa now for three years and not one have I heard some crazy things like this. How can people possibly think they are being reached out by aliens that is just so crazy I cant stress that enough. I think if aliens were real why would they want to be found if they are smart like people think they are because they can fly a spaceship then why would they leave that face there for us to find it.

If I was a alien I would not want to be found because who knows what they would do to me I would be so so frighten its not even funny. The other reason why I dont think it has anything to do with an alien is because where is that face from? Is it from an alien or human? How to we know if its even a face it can simply just be a rock that looks like face we do not know sure. For all we know this picture can actually be fake. They might just have wanted people to start thinking its a face and that we are living under aliens. I think my team in Nasa is just crazy straight up crazy.

So this is what I think about the whole alien thing this is not alien related stuff at all. It was never anything about alien stuff or egyption goddess stuff either its jusyt simply a rock that look like a face nothing more notrhig less.
