School policy

Dear Principle,

I think that your rule about the new school policy should not be tolerated. I think that students should be able to play sports no matter what their grades are. What if the sport their playing is their only exercise. What if that is the only time to be with friends out of school. what if the sports is helping them get good grades. I will tell you why grades don't matter to play sports in this letter.

So what if the sport their playing is their only time and place for exercise. If their getting a C then they can't get that exercise. They will gain a lot of weight and get out of shape until the grades are up. And cupid U.S. is already dealing with an obesity problem; Don't make it so there is another reason for us to gain weight.

What would happen if the only time to see friends was at their sports practice or games. If one person was getting bad grades and the others were getting good grades then no one would be able to see their friends. Soon that person will be detached from his/her friends and not be able to make new ones. Would you want to have some of your students not to have friends all because of you?

What if the sport he/she is playing makes them get good grades. Then when the sport is taken away he/she will continue to get bad grades. When a student plays a sport it will keep them awake and energized. When the student can no longer play that sport they will feel tired and not be able to work as hard. Also, when a student plays a sport it is proven that they will sleep better. When students sleep better they will be more alert in school. Don't you want your students to shine?

That is why i think that grades should not matter to play sports. No one wants their child to become overweight. Everyone wants friends, and everyone wants good grades. Remember how fun it was playing sports when you were a kid. How would it feel to have that taken away if you had one C. Done take away sports!
