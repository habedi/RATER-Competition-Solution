Dear principal,

I believe that it would not be fair to the students that are incapable of receiving a B grade average to not be able to enjoy their school activities! why? Well because those are the classes were we all just take a brake from other subjects like math, science and other subjects that we may take! Besides we need some of these classes for example physical education in this class not only do we have fun with our friends and take brakes from learning but we also get fit and in shape and this is something that's important for your health!

Further more, there are a lot of students that are in tutoring from Monday through Friday up to 6:00 pm and now even taking our personal time to come to a program like Saturday academy! Too much learning is bad for students we all need a brake from that and when we take those special school activities is when we get to have that brake!

Do to the fact of all that i have just explained, I beg of you to please just let us have these special activities these are activities that we just simply need! I hope that me taking the time and writing this letter to you will convince you to allow everyone in the school to be able to enjoy these activities! I would also appreciate it if you would let me know what your final decision will be.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
