Education is a driving force which motivates individuals around the world to work for their goals. Most people receive education in a classroom setting, whether that is in a school, university, etc. However many people around the world do not have the ability to travel to a school everyday in order to pursue an education. As a result, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from having the ability to take classes from their home because it allows them to pursue an education if they cannot find transportation to school, limits distraction, and provides students with a more flexible schedule.

Many individuals who wish to pursue an education are unable to because of their lack of transportation, however, through the option of distance learning an education is within reach for most people. For example, kids who cannot find transportation to and from school everyday can now take classes within the comfort of their own home. Transportation is no longer an issue for those who desire an education. Students can also avoid distractions ,such as appearance and large numbers of peers, by taking classes in their own home. This allows students to truly prioritize learning if they wish to do so. In addition, students are not bothered with the stress of fitting in. By removing these pressures and distractions the productivity of a student will increase.

The schedule of the average high school student is very hectic, but when distance learning is implemented the chaos that they experience can be avoided. For example, the average high school student spends about six hours in school, two hours participating in extracurricular activities, and two hours doing homework. All of this work must be crammed into an extremely tight window of time in order to allow time for a sufficient amount of sleep. However, when distance learning is utilized students can take classes and complete the designated work at their convenience. This allows for more time to focus on personal growth, participate in hobbies, and sleep. All of these are very important to the development of an individual outside of an academic setting, and distance learning makes it possible for students to dedicate more time to these activities rather than strictly academics.

Although the benefits of distance learning outweigh the negatives some still argue that distance learning isn't effective. While some say that distance learning will lead to a decrease in productivity and effort in an academic setting they are not entirely correct. Distance learning may not confine students to an academic setting for ten hours a day, but it does ensure that the student learns the material and is able to apply it to real-life situations. Productivity should also increase because students have more time to focus on personal health and other activities which they enjoy.

In conclusion, distance learning is a great opportunity which holds many benefits for students. Through the use of distance learning students have the ability to pursue an education no matter where they live. They can also dedicate more of their day to personal growth in a non-academic context while still working towards obtaining an education. Students are also able to eliminate any distractions which they may find in a general classroom setting. All in all, distance learning provides students with the chance to pursue an education while also focusing on themselves as people.
