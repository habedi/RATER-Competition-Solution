Studying Venus was more rather a hard task for explorer's to do. Not only what is contained in the planet but its features and its structure was very dangerous. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. It being the 'shinning star' explorers might have thought knowing more aboutit in a closer distance would be much educative for them.

Venus being the closest planet to the sun it is assumed to be pretty hot and that answers why its' called the 'shinning star' and also why it can be seen and good distance from any point on earth. The tempertaure in there is "average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmopheric pressureis 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."This information that they gave out here shows how dangerious it is to be out there especially at an environment our earthly body is not used to.

The studies of Venus have shown that even explorers are scared to venture ou there and have no choice but to look formachines to help them look out there and know how its like on Venus. THe danger that is out in Venus is not going to begiven up on and they are gooing to find other ways to go to Venus.
