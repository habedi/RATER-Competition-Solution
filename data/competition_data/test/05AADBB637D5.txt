Phones & Driving Eassay

Phones and driving has been a big issue in the past and there have been many arguments on should we have phones while driving. I don't think it's the phones in this problem or case, I think it's the teens they are not responsible enough to stay off their phones while on the road. There have been many car crashes and 70% of them are teens on their cell phones. Adults are also on their phone while on the road. There are a lot of lives being took In fatal car accidents, cars are not anything to be played with you only get one life. It was a law passed that you can't talk while driving but that's not the case because you can always use speaker phone.

In 2018 there was a law passed that the driver can't have a cellphone in his or her hand while driving but that law was senseless because of speakerphone. Phones can be very destracing while drivng because of people texting you and replying back to a message. It should be an outstanding ticket for those who are caught texting while driving. In 2016 there were 365 people killed in Georgia that means every day at least one person was killed that year. It has to be an end to these fatal car accidents.

I think there should be a law passed in every state that phones shouldn't be picked up in a vehicle by the driver at all unless of emergency. It's only fair to the community that a no cell phone policy should be passed because innocent citizens are dying. Car accidents are not just tied around phones because most accidents are people under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the United Sates. Eliminating cell phones would be just reduce accidents and keeping family and friends safe. Nobody wants to loose their life in a car from someone texting and not paying attention to the road.

Phones are mainly for entertainment purposes, when you are on the road you have to keep your eyes up and stay focused. When you are getting your driving license you should have to sign a paper saying you won't use your cellphone while on the road or you will be fined and loss of driving privileges. There has been to many people took from their family behind a car. Cars are more dangerous from the looks and airbags don't always save you. Often times the airbags hurt you.

In the future I wish to see a new law passed regarding cellphones while on the road. I feel like if they pass that new law the % of car accidents will reduce. It's going to be that one person to save our following citizens , and pass that law to help us as a whole. If this law do pass it will be a significant change in the deaths per year. Cellphones should be banned while on the road because the high death rate.
