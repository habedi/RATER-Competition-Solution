Dear Principle,

My view of the possible policy change is that it is wrong. Many students in the school like myself think that it is too challenging. Don't you trust the students at the school enough to know that we are already trying our best to do what we can? What do you think about students who are already trying the best of their abilities having their activities and privileges taken because their work wasn't good enough or up to your standard?

You might think that this policy change is right and that it could serve as a motivation for better grades or something but, what if the opposite happens? What if your goal for better grades fail and more people have worse grades to serve as retaliation for what you have done? What are you going to say to people when they ask you why this happened? You will have to tell them of the policy change and why it went wrong.

Even though I know that there are people who purposely don't work hard enough and purposely damage themselves in our school, can't you think of a way to try to motivate them to work harder without hurting the whole school community? Not everyone with a C as a grade or lower are slacking off you know. Why not make some activities that benefit everyone at school like making a math club for example instead of taking away sports and other activities from people with a C average or lower?

So principle, I hope you have read and considered this idea because many people like me do not want the policy change.
