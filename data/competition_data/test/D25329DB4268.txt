Students nowadays have more and more options in the classroom then they ever have had in the past. Whether that classroom is in a building, or online, the ways in which people can learn are getting more and more limitless. One of the headlines however are if students will benefit from taking classes at the comfort of one's home, or if it should be in a composed classroom. Taking classes at home is a much better ideas for a few reasons. The first being the amount of freedom it gives, second is that it increases work ethic from students, and promotes more efficient working skills, and the third and final reason is that it lets the student work at his or her own pace.

The amount of freedom working from home gives is imense, as it changes the entire playing field in a way. That student is no longer being held by getting to school at 8:10, or waking up at six AM in the morning risking a good nights sleep. Instead, students can start work when they feel like they are refreshed enough too. It's silly to think that every students goes to bed at nine, and wakes up and six, eats a nice breakfast, and leaves for school feeling the best they've ever felt. It just doesn't make sense, and often explains why students nap in class so often. Working from home also opens up many more possibilites, like eating lunch when the student desires, and taking breaks when he or she wants. This freedom can relieve the stress on many students, really opening up the potential they have to unlock.

Work ethic is something that varies from student to student, and isn't the same for everyone. After all, the motivation to achieve all As isn't the same in every student. You can, however, maximize the productivity and work ethic in students very easily. Most students aren't motivated for school because they have to go to school. Imagine a world where the worst possible morning for school was waking up and logging on. When you let a student be comfortable and work from home, the productivity skyrockets. This topic goes hand and hand with topic one on freedom. If you give a student that needs motivation, a reason to work harder, they will. By giving students the freedom to work from home, than more often than not, they will work much harder, and more efficiently.

One of the most common problems in the classroom these days is that a teacher is going to fast, or too slow. And in a classroom of 25 different, unique students, it's almost impossible to find that middle ground where everyone is pleased and efficient. When working from home, this eliminates all chances of that happening, as a student is free to work at their own pace, and get learn at their rate. It's almost like telling a group of runners, run this mile in 5 minutes. The longer the run, the more reduced grade, the shorter the better. Of course there are going to be students that crush that run, and need a better challenge, but you also cannot forget about the runners who struggled, and are begging for a slower speed because they're lagging behind. Working from home is like saying, "everyone has 10 minutes to run this mile. Shorter does not equal better, the only penalization is taking longer than that deadline". With students working at their own pace, it can only benefit topic two, which talks about work ethic.

Working from home can only benefit the student, and should be an option for all students to take this route. More schools should consider this option, as it gives students freedom, promotes work ethic, and lets students work at their own pace.
