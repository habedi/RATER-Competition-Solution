You've probably heard the saying, "Try new things." You may be tired of hearing it, but it's actually a good thing to do. Being in extracurricular activities is a way to try new things that you might not have known you like. I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because you can explore something you haven't before, you can make friends, and you might find that it's something you enjoy.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allows you to explore different options that you haven't before. Trying new things is a good way to see what you like and dislike. You could realize that you love to play sports through extracurricular activities. You could also gain experience. Having experience in different fields can be helpful for academic and life purposes. Participating in an extracurricular activity might be helpful for the future. It could help with getting a job and it could end up being your career path. Getting the opportunity to explore new things is a reason you should participate in extracurricular activities.

Making friends is also a bonus when you are in an activity. You can find people with similar interests as you. Starting conversations with others is easier if you're in the same activity as them. You could have fun while participating with others. Doing things with other people can make you enjoy the activity more. Participating is also an opportunity for you to meet new people you wouldn't have known if you weren't in an extracurricular activity. You could make long lasting friendships you wouldn't have made if you didn't participate. Being in an extracurricular activity is a fun way to make new friends.

The downside is that you would be forced to be in an activity. If you are forced to do something, it can make the activity less fun. However, you could find that the activity is something you really like to do. You can find out new things about yourself or find a new hobby. Extracurricular activities are outlets for you to find new things that you enjoy.

I think that students should participate in an extracurricular activity. You get to explore different things, you can make new friends, and you could find that the activity you're in is something you like to do. Even though you would be forced to participate, extracurricular activities are something everyone can enjoy.
