Schools will stop students from succeeding if students learn online. Many schools are now allowing students to attend classes by video conferencing and other online ways. Students in certain schools have not just taken, but also passed core classes along with electives through online programs. Teachers use video calling applications like Skype or FaceTime to teach and educate students. Students should not be able to attend online classes or use video conferencing as a way of education because there are too many distractions in a students home, students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom, and the internet is not reliable.

One reason that students should not learn online is because there are too many distractions in a students home for them to focus entirely on the subject at hand. For an example, if a student has younger siblings running around their work space at home, the student will not get a proper education because they will be constantly distracted. Another reason that students should not learn online is because students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom. There are tons of online applications that help students cheat on tests and even simple worksheets given out by educators. If a teacher cannot physically see the student right in front of them taking a test or working on a paper, then that teacher cannot be sure that the student does not have an electronic device present that is helping them get all the answers off of the internet. The final reason that students should not learn online is because the internet is unreliable. When a student is working online, their internet might not always be stable, WiFi might not always be available in the students home, the teacher and students devices might not always be compatible with one another, and finally, the student might not always have access to a device.

Many people believe that schools should offer long distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, however, students should not be able to attend online classes or use video conferencing as a way of education because there are too many distractions in a students home, students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom, and the internet is not reliable. Students should stick to the traditional way of learning, it has worked for hundreds of years in the past. We should not change the way of our education system if their is nothing wrong with it to begin with.
