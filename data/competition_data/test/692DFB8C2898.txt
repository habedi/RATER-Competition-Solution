Cell phones should not be at use when in class. Sometimes a student will text under their desk or in the backpack trying to hide it when in class when they should not be. I think Policy 1 would clear that problem right up. The reason I have chosen this policy is because, like I had stated before students do not need there cell phones in class, but when they are at lunch the office can't send a pass for a student not to be found, because they are at lunch. If a student's parent were to bring a lunch for their child the student would not be able to receive it in time before their lunch time is over. So, students should be aloud to call or to text their parent's so they know when they can go to the office and receive their lunch.

Although students should not use there cell phones during any other free times in class only because who ever they are texting, maybe a friend, that other student may not be having free time in their class. So that student would be disrupting his/her class and disobeying their teacher. When a student is texting in class that means that they are not listening to what their teacher is teaching them. So if a test comes or a quiz the student will not know what to do because he/her was texting and not listening in class. I think policy 1 would and should be the right policy to be enforced for this school.
