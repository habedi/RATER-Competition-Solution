dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard that you came up with two new cell phone policies and you cant decide which one to use. You probably think since I am a student that I would go for policy number 1 but you are sadly mistaken. I am in favor of policy number two because I know us teenagers. We might agree with turning it off during class time but I assure you we wont. I think we will be on the phone all the time looking on facebook or texting a friend we would hardly pay attention. that would probably be the worst policy in the history of policies.

If you don't believe me you can do an experiment. One class can have policy number 1 and one class can have policy number two. You can teach them the same exact thing and give them the same test on Friday and see who gets the highest percentage passes. To make sure its accurate you can do the test multiple times I'm sure you will get the same results. one reason I think this policy would be a bad idea is that we aren't mature enough to handle having phones on in school . We would probably cheat on tests or something, but that's just my opinion on the matter.

sincerely
