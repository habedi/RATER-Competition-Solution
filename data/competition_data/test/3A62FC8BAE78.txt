There are many times where you have probably witnessed a friend or person's face looking too calm or sad to you, and when you asked them what's wrong they tell you nothing.

After a while you start to just let it go,respect their privacy and wait til they're ready to really tell you whats's on their mind. This applies the same way from a computer to a student. Some students may not want the computer to be invading their privacy and knowing what's wrong with them, they would rather keep it to themselves.

It's also a likely chance that a students emotions will not change just because the computer can detect it.
