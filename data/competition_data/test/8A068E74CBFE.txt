Do you think Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers? I think it can worth it because it is one of the planets that is close to us (Earth). Venus is sometimes called "Evening Star," is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. The things I will get to tell you will explode your mind about Venus.

First, Venus is very dangerous to visit. For example, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus`s atmosphere.

In fact, scientists are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ao, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can sometimes be our neaarest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.

Finally, NASA is working on other approchaes to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus`s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II. These calcualtions by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

In conclusion, these are all the details on how Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They have a lot of factors that makes it so much fun to learn despite it`s danger. Scientist will find a way to reach Venus and study it for years to come. Would you ever study Venus after reading this?
