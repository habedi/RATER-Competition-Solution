The car can be very helpful in some way. If a blind person needs to go somewhere and they have like service dog that can guide them to the places they need to go. The car isnt realy helpful when it comes to road blocks and crashes on the road, the person have to drive the car past whatever is in the way and then it goes back into being a car that can drive by itslef. Google needs to update their car so it can drive by crashes and road blocks instead having a person drive the car past it.

The car can be very helpful but Google just needs to update the car on things so it can be a better car for TONS of people. They need to make the car driveless because most people hate driving and their hands and arms get tried of holding onto the wheel.
