Using this type of technology of emotional expressions will be very useful for teacher and parents to help their students or children to see if something or someone is making them feel happy, angry, disgusted, or feared. Having this technology in schools will also help parents because the parents don't have to buy a computer that can try to handle this type of technology.

If teachers do a test on students that are getting bulied or getting picked on, this type of technology will help teacher get students to speak up and or find the person that is bullys other students. By showing the student that's getting pick on a picture of students the teacher thinks who maybe the person bulling the student, the student may make a fear face on the picture of the person that is picking on the student.

If teachers see that a student is failing their classes and don't talk a lot in school, the teachers can make a test on that student to see if they are going through things back at home. Teachers can have the students parents to come to the school while the student is being tested, they can have a converation on what makes the student angry or depressed about.

Those are some example why I think this type of technology can really help teachers and parents learn about their students or children that they don't want to speak of. This can also help parents that can't afford this type of technology at home and having this technology at school, parents can bring their children to the school and have them get tested on what's bothering them at school or home.
