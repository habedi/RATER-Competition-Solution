I'm going to talk about the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus". By this unknown author who wrote this. My name is PROPER_NAME and this will be an essay so bare with me. It will be long and show how the author supports the idea. Without a further due, lets jump right into this essay.

The author talks how the idea of people can adpat to the conditions of Venus and settle there like our home planet Earth. There are some problems that he think are challenges. The planet is 90 times the amount of pressure we have on Earth. Most of the air is carbon dioxide blankets that covers 97 percent of the planet's thick atmosphere. The temperature is around about to 800 degrees on the planet.

Venus that has the hottest surface temperature that would melt anything on contact including people. Also, it would crush you or anything else like a piece of paper. There is also bad weathering that cause problems. Like for example: erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

On the postive side, we can make a vehicle that will let us float above the fray. Use solar energy to power the vehicle to float. We can avoid the unfriendly conditions on the ground. The degress will be around toasty at around 170 degrees. The pressure will be around sea level on Earth. The radiation would not exceed Earth levels.

This why I think the authors idea is good. It can help us show how humans are progressing through the years of tech advancements. This world will become someday extinct and we will somehow surivive. NASA will always find a way to expand. Thank you for reading this essay and I hope you enjoy.
