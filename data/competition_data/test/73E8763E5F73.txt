Dear Principal,

I think that you shouldn't make all students do community service. Because maybe some of us want to do other things. Or maybe some of us have to do other things like homework or baby sit. To me not all the time students are going to want to do community service. Because if it were me I wouldn't want to do community service myself either. I TRUELY know that helping the community is important. But don't you think that our own time is important too? I'm not trying to be selfish with my time. If you really do think about it then maybe you'll understand where I am coming from. I probably don't make any sense to you, but not all students might want to do it. From my opinion I do not think that you should make all students work on their community service. I agree with the students that help others, and tutor elementary students and also pick up litter. But I think I'm going to agree more with the other half of the students. Because to me it kind of does take a lot of time away from the things we do or the things we want to do. For one example: say like if you have a whole lot of homework to do and its due tomorrow. But you also have the community service. What are you going to do the community service that your principal requires for you to do or the homework that's mandatory? See not all the time were going to have our time to do the things we need to do. I say that what if you give us a vote in on it. And we'll give you (the principal) the results for what all of us students think is better for us. Because i know that even when we do the things we want to do or the things we need to do we can also help others at the same time like tutor the kids that need help in what were working on. Some students might want to agree with you and some might not want to. So yeah! That's my suggestion on what you should and shouldn't do. Please take the time to read over this letter and think about it. Thank you very much!

Sincerely,

Student
