Well for one if we limit car usage, gas wouldn't pollute the air as much and make Earth a much better planet. I think it would be much better to limit the use of cars because then there wont be as much deaths due to accidents and serious car wrecks. Not as much drunk drivers just a bunch of drunk walkers. I feel that if everyone either walked or biked everywhere, the community would be a much better place as a whole. You would be able to meet new people everyday.

You would never have to worry about car insurance anymore because you wouldn't have a car! No more money for damages or issues with the car. The community would just be a lot more peaceful if cars weren't involved with our days society. Just like when Heidrun Walter stated when they had a car they were always tense. Now that they don't they are much happier! The Environmental Protection Agency is already promoting car reduced communities, which I think is a good idea!

I think we should also have a day like Bogota had when they go a day without cars for their improvement campaign. They have constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths. This would also improve traffic if we cut down on cars in the United States. New restaurants and shopping districts could be made from the outcome! As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak in 2005 and is now equal to where the country was in January 1995! A study last year found that young drivers decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009! Im all for cutting down on car usage in the United States! I think it would be an awesome opportunity to be apart of.
