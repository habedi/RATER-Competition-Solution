Dear Principle,

I have seen you have been wanting to change the school policy. You want to change the grade from C to a B and if you don't make a B you will not let us play an any sports activity. A lot of kids want to play sports in junior high school and some kids have low B' s but most of us have C 's. I think you should change it for a while because are coach now doesn't check if we our failing and people are getting away with it. When football starts again you should go back to a C because its tough not getting to play. Well if you haven't known after football we have off season. You should change it to B' s because that allows us to get more responsibility to us and have more charter in our self. I am starting to hate people that are failing and getting away with it. They start to bug me a lot. I want them to do extra work so they know now not to fail again. When ever they do work i feel good in my self saying i told you so. I do make very good grades because i try my best to do my work, but some don't care about school at all. I really want to make it to college and to do my to get there is to pass classes and work hard. Like i said before people don't care about school all they want to do is go home and sleep and play a kind of game system or whatever they do on a regular basics. I really hope you read this to yourself and know why i am typing this to you and i really want to make a change with you at school like some people do to so lets do it.

Sincerely,

P.S Lets make a change to this school.
