Dear Principle,

I think that it would be a major mistake to change the eligibility grade for sports from a C to a B. This would punish the kids that want to do good in school and work hard in it but still get bad grades. It would also be punishing the kids that do good in school and play sports because you are depriving them of a winning team, which I know all sports players want.

Kids like me that do great in school and at sports would be missing out. We want to win and we want to win now. And if you are taking away good players, winning doesn't happen. You will lose the respect of a whole lot of kids in this school if you heighten the sports eligibility grade from a C to an B. Like i said before some kids have trouble learning fast and do bad in school. But those kids try to do well most of the time.

I would understand if you wanted to change the average GPA from a 1.9 qualification to like a 2.5, because that means that I could almost fail and still play a sport. That isn't asking enough out of the kids if they can do that.

If you did change the rule, and a player had lower than a B average and he or she played a sport. You should go to that persons teachers and ask them if he/she is putting forth effort to keep grade up, and if they are, than that person should be able to play still. If a kid is doing bad and not putting forth any effort to do well, than he/she should be put on probation until their grades improve. If the grades don't improve then he/she will not be aloud to play or practice with the team until grades improve.

I hope you choose the right answer and take my advice from the last two paragraph's.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
