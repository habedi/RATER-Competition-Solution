In my community, I know many people who enjoy doing community service not only for the credit, but for their own joy. I also know many people who do not like to do community service at all, and simply don't have time as well. I say, that students have the right to serve as they please, and should not have to be forced to help the community.

I myself personally don't have much time for community service. On the weekdays, I have school, homework, and house chores. On the weekends, I have basketball, church, and more chores! I'm pretty sure other students have a pretty similar schedule to me as well. Sure, I have time for a few hours on the weekends, and that's when I do community service, but not much. If I was forced to squeeze in extra hours into my schedule, things would get much more complicated. Forcing students to do community service could get community service done, but if kids are angry I don't think they would do their best job in doing something. For example, when I am angry, I do things angry. I play basketball angry, I wash dishes angry, I play games angry, etc. This anger might be good sometimes to fuel aggression for sports, but not when doing community service. A student may insult a homeless person while their serving food, and the homeless person might never go to that shelter again. That could be very bad. I'm not saying that helping the community isn't important, by all means it is. But that doesn't mean that we should be forced to change our whole schedule. Instead of forcing students to help out, maybe the school could give benefits to the people who do. For example, students could get service cards and get it signed by the program they helped. For each hour, students earn a certain amount of points. At the end of a time period, that student could buy prizes our treats with his or her points. This may not be the best way to reward people who did community service, but this is just an example.

In conclusion, I say that community service should not be forced upon to students. Not only is it morally wrong, but it is ineffective as well. Students should do community service out of the will of their heart, not the will of their school.
