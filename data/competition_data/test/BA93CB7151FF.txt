Hi I am Luke. I am one of the participants of the Seagoing Cowboys program. I am here to tell you why you should join the program. At first you may think its boring, but as I tell you about it you will regret thinking that it is boring.

The first thing you should know about it is that you are going to be seeing alot of farm animals. Also I hope you are not afraid of water because we are going to be on the sea. And another thing you should know about it is that you are going to be herding and taking good care of the animals. Ok we got the bad things out of the way. Now the good things about it is that you can go to many places. For example I got to go to Europe, Greece, and China. You also would get to play sports and games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. I played baseball and volleyball.

So what do you think? I know it seems scary, but you will have lots of fun! I was grateful for the opportunity to go. If you went you probably would have been grateful too.
