Limiting car usage can be a good effect but also can cause a lot of stress. In source 2 it tells how on Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or they would get fine with a $30 dollar charge. An it happened to odd numbered plates the next day. I dont htink thats a good thing to go by because some people might have jobs hoe are they suppose to go to work? other than a city bus.

Source 3 tells me In German Suburb they do things without cars. An it say that 70 percent of Vauban's families dont own cars. An the people who do have cars 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are responsible for it. Source 2 also talks about a even that they have that last all day. The event is to not use cars during the whole day. Lots of otheer countries thought that it was a good idea so they joined into the evnet. The day without cars is part of a improvement campaign that started in Bagota in the mid-1990s.
