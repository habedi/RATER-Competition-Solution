Throughout the article author, Nick D'Alto, meets Dr. Huang who has created a way to recognize someones real emotions through technonlgy and a computer system that could help people read emotions of students in a class room. The new software that has been developed and is being used on humans is the Facial Action Coding System. The first subject was the Mona Lisa painting, to us it is just a portrait with a woman in it smiling, but to Dr. Huang he uses a coding system to find out that she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2% angry (D'Alto 1). This was all figured out by a computer, now imagine being able to read a whole class room full of students real emotions with just one click of a button.

If teachers and other students knew how a whole class room of students were actually feeling deep down inside everyone could probably end up having a good day everyday. Most people like to keep their emotions privite, because living in this world today anyone can put a smile on their face and pretend they are okay. Not everyone is really ever always okay. Which us humans are aware of because we can tell how someone is feeling just by the looks on their face. Yet humans are not experts so to us, "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal." (D'Alto 4). No one ever truly knows how one another is feeling, but this Facial coding system can help fix that. Evidence states in paragraph 8, "To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celbrity isn't being truthful." With this new technology humans can physically no longer lie about how they are feeling. While joining this experiment it is said by, "the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them." So if a class room of students just joined this experiment it could actually make them much more happier.

Concluding, that this tecnological emotional experiment being used on a classroom full of students could help everyone have a good day every day. Everwhere around the world humans can put a smile on their face and predend they are okay, but with this new coding system it could truly help prevent that. If a student in the class room was pretending to be okay, and then stood infront of the computure to be coded it would pick up the real emotions on the face just by obseving a mouth being streached sideways using the zygomatic major and risorius revealing the student isn't actually happy. With the help of Science and Dr. Huang it could reveal so much more about the real emotions in someone elses life that no one ever knew about.
