The article, "Making Mona Lisa Smile", speaks of the impressive and amazing ways science is moving forward. This article has many different parts that all have to do with detecting emotions, such as speaking of the processes, catagorizing, what could happen in the future with this technology, and faking it until it works.

The first line of the article says, "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." This is the article speaking about Mona Lisa's facial expression in the famous painting. The article goes on to speak of the process. It starts when a computer creates a 3-D model of the particular person's face. It says " all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles". They say the movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit". Continuing in the article, Paul Eckman, the creator of Facial Action Coding System, classified the six basic emotions. These emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He further associated each characteristic with the movement of certain facial muscles. They generalized emotions with muscles because "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal." The software they use can even identify a mix and range of emotions, which is why they gave percents for the Mona Lisa. Further in the article it is said that the computers are simply soing what humans do everyday. We can tell when someone around us is upset, simply by their face. They say that this would be helpful in the future in terms of sadness or happiness based on the ads we see. If an ad pops up and it sees we don't like it, the ad will leave and a new one may appear. The same thing goes in recognizing if a student is bored or confused. It may change the teaching style in order to adapt to the way the child learns. A few paragraphs later, the article basically says if you smile and use the muscles that automatically trigger when you're happy, you will start feeling happy because you are tricking your brain.

Dr. Haung says "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too." This is important because new developments can further our ability to communicate with the people and world around us.
