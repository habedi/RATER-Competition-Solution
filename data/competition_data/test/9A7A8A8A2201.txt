Dear Principal,

I do not believe that every student should be required to perform community service. Not all students do have the time to go and meet a mandatory community service quota. If you were to assign students to complete a community service program and give them a grade on it, many students would fail. This would cause the students to be ineligible to do other school activities that they have signed up for.

However, I do support you with thinking that people should do community service, after all, it is their community. I think that instead of making it a mandatory thing to do, you could set up an extracurricular club that would help the community. This would make it easier for some students to get a grade for what they are doing and still have time for other activities that they have signed up to do.

If you were to make it a club, then you would be able to require the members of that club to go and fill a community service time quota for the year. Many school clubs do this as a way to make the members proud of their community and to show that the club members and the school care about what the community has to offer and what their community stands for. The club would mean something to everybody. This also has a chance of increasing the amount of participants in community service.

I thank you for considering what I have had to say about this. Please make the decision that you feel would be best for everyone involved. I also applaud you for supporting your community.

Sincerely,

Student
