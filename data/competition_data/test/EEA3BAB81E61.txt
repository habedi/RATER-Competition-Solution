The reason it would be a bad thing is say you dont want nobody to know how your feeling. Some people dont like it when other people know how they feel i hate when other people know how i feel. Another thing is that maby youru feeling a way and you dont want nobody els to know how your feeling cause you might get juged for how you feel.

Thers some good things to this to, cause when an add pop up you dont want it to be a boring one, you want it to be like a cool movie coming out or an new fortnite update and etc. And with the computer being like that it would amke you want to stay and watch it. Another thing is is that when an add comes on it makes people lose there happyness palying the game and so they just get off the game amd gop do something else, cause usally the adds be like 30sec-1min long and dont nobody want to wait that long to go back to there game so they just get off it and go to the nect game they like cause know they got addsw in almot everything and if your playing a game and you die then its an add and people get tired of that and dont want to play anymore.

in the article it says that smiling and frownimg will help the computer relise weather you like the add of not. If not then they willa diffrent on next time and if you smile are look intrerested in the add they will do more like that one and then it would go from there. But again not all people like people knowing how they feel some people keepm there self privet and with that nobody could feel privet anymore. So no i dont think they should put that in computers cause it would mess it up for the people that liked to be keep ther self privet
