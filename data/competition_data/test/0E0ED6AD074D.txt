Dear, Principle

I think we should change the original policy and go with policy #1

We students were abusing our cell phone privileges and were being distracted, and distracting others. I approve of policy #1 because, it allows us to still have our cell phones yet helps prevent us from being distracted or distracting. I think it is very appropriate to only be allowed to use them during free times.

I do not think policy #2 would be a good choice for the following reasons:

Students need some way in contacting someone in an emergency before, during, or after school, even if the problem is the don't have a ride, or want to see if they could hang out at a friends house. What if they forget something at home. We all know some student forget his or her home work today. do you want the office phone all jammed up just for home work? What if there is a fire, cant use the office phone its all plugged up.

In conclusion, Policy 1 Lets students have there phones unless they use them during class. Prevents distractions so that students can learn and not be distracted. Thus policy also lets students have some freedom with their phones, but only during there free periods/lunch. Policy 2, however, does not even let them have there phone at school no matter what. It also prevents them from getting help in case of emergency, or even lack of ride. This is why Policy 1 is the better choice of the change of policies.

Sincerely,

The Students.
