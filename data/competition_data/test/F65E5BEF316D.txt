Dear Principal,

Although at first, it may seem as if a little leniency with the phone policy will help, it won't. personally, I believe in option number two, where there are no cell phones what so ever. With that small amount of responsibility given to the students, many kids they will still be able to go out of control with it.

First and foremost, is that with given the option to have phones during free time we will see a great increase in phone usage in the classroom. It could be for many reasons, including, having not finished their conversation, "forgot" to turn them off, have something "important" that they have to address, or a whole mess of other things. Many kids will just keep their phones on and use them during class furthering their distraction in class. I'm sorry to say this, but we, at our age just can't be trusted to uphold a thing such as that, I know of many people who even now, without any free time with phones, use them regularly in class, and that is with a strict policy.

Secondly is the limited control on cell phones. We have no idea what may be sitting on any kids phone at any time. If allowed, there will be so many phones that proper monitoring will be impossible! I know from experience that there can and is some seriously nasty stuff on just about every persons phone in this school. Technology just hasn't advanced enough to keep a watch out for such things on something like a cell phone. There is no plausible way that we could stem the profanity that would enter our school.

Lastly, and definitely not the least, is the amount of bullying that can happen with bullying, you think rumors spread quickly now. Oh boy, are you in for a surprise when phones get introduced into the picture. Things can be spread in an instant to every person at any second. Lives will be ruined. and friendships broken, just because of a little 6 inch piece of plastic. I believe that is by far the worst harm that can come from phones. being put down in front of your

I know it may sound like I'm being harsh, but it is fair. People at this age just can't be trusted all together with such open devices. You of all people should know, since I'm sure you've had many cases of this, that we can't have such things to distract us from the one thing that upholds our future. Our education.
