Dear Principal,

My personal take on the community service issue is, I don't believe that kids should be required to do community service.

I say that because, kids that don't want to be there aren't going to put out much more effort if they were forced to be there and had no choice. On the other hand, kids that do want to be there will happy that they are helping the community. Don't get me wrong though, I'm not saying that community service is bad or not important. I just believe that kids that want to be there will be a lot more help than kids that don't want to be there. Look at it like this, 25 hardworking and kids eager to better their community is much better than 100 kids who have to be there and don't want to.

I'm not at all trying to say that making kids do community service is horrible or anything of that nature, nor am I trying to say that kids should rather be playing video games all day instead. I just believe that kids who want to be there will do a much better job than kids that don't.

Also, I think their education is more important than community service. If community service was manditory, than it might interfere with their school work. I believe that they should be more focused on school rather than bettering their community. Plus, I think kids just also need time to be kids. Sports, friends, or whatever it might be might also interfere with there after school actives. Instead of forcing them to do community service, talk to the kids that have pretty high averages in all their classes and maybe send a letter home asking them if they want to participate. Maybe, you could bribe them with an award or something so kids would be eager to come. Thank you for reading.

Sincerely,
