We should keep the Electoral College because it helps the people choose a president easily then just by popular votes. The process that helps the people choose a president is easy thanks to the Electorl College. According to the source 1 "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens." (source 1).

The process for Electoral College is very simple for our Nation. The process as stated is "The Electoral College process consits of selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress." (Source 1). That is why we should keep the Electoral College because the process is that simple.

The reason we shouldn't get rid of the Electoral College because just electing a President on popular votes is not far to the states that don't get to many votes. As stated in the article " The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor." (Source 1). The disaster that comes with the electoral college can be catastrophic.
