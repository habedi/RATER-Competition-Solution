"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." That is a direct quote from Jim Garvin himself, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. If a well-educated researcher such as Garvin says that the face-like feature on Mars is simply a natural land formation, why shouldn't we believe him. There is too much evidence disproving the theory that the face is an alien structure or artifact for the idea to even be fathomable.

The picture clearly shows that this formation could not possibly be that of alien descent. Scientists have proved on three different occasions that it is merely another isolated Martian mesa, which was common in the area Cydonia. NASA scientist Jim Garvin states, "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa," which only proves further that there is no sign of unknown life present on Mars.

Although NASA researchers would have benefited from having found alien life on Mars, they have proved that no such life exists or has existed on the planet Mars. Three different images from three separate missions has only proved this point further, there is no ancient alien marking or signs on Mars whatsoever.
