Just another day working at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Day's at the Lab went by as any other day for the scientist's, not finding anything new up in space, just a few minor event's here and there, but nothing big. I went in my office, and was informed today we were going to try and find any possible landing site's for Viking 1's sister ship, Viking 2. As usual we went to work. Orbiting Mars for what seemed like an eternity! I'm literally bored out of my mind, until out of the corner of my eye I see something, not just a star or anything, but to my eyes looked like a human face staring right back at us through Viking 1.

Confusion is all us scientist's felt when we saw that face on Mars, just plain fear and confusion. Nothing was spoken much about it among us scientist's since we were all super shocked and speechless, that was until we were on our lunch break. All I heard was "Alien's", really alien's can they possibly pin this "face" on Aliens! The table next to me also seemed to think alien's made this Egyptian-type face. I dont know what came over me something just clicked and I said "How can you possibly pin this on alien's?!" of course this started a one-on-one argument with me and another scientist "What do you mean, how can it not be Alien's" he answered. "First of all, it was spotted near Cydonia, a part of Mars where Martian Mesa's are commonly being found everyday, so how do we not know it isn't just another Mesa?" "If you think this is a mesa, how would it take form to look like a human being's face? Dont you think that is too much of a coincidence to happen?!" at that I left it alone, maybe it was too much of a coincidence, but that wasn't going to affect my thought on the "Mesa"

The word on the "Face" spreaded around the world, becoming a hot topic for people everywhere, most of them thinking it was made by Alien's. I didnt really get much into it until that scientist kid came up to me again, "Still think it wasn't made by alien's?!" "Of course, why wouldn't I?" "How can you not think it was alien's! The picture became known to the world and everyone think's it was alien's, which they are probably right!!" "How can we know for sure this was created by alien's!? Think about it we dont have great technology yet, that "Mesa" was in the form of a face because our photo was too blurry and it was really cloudy!!" I really didnt want to end up on the wrong foot with this guy so i just walked away.

April 5,1998- I walk into the office and apparently we are going to take a look at Cydonia for the "Face" again. This was actually a releif to me, because I know that now our technology is way more advanced and we could see with a sharper picture what this thing really is, a mesa. So it happened Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took a picture ten time's sharper than the old one! As to my conclusion, the egyptian face ended up to be a mesa! This mesa took form of a face because of the shadow's that went over the mesa. As I heard of this new's I couldn't help but look back at that one scientist, and whipering "Look who the right one is now!" with the most accomplishing smirk on my face that I can make. ;]
