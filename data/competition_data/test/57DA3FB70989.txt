What if students could design their own summer projects? As the summer gets closer and closer, some schools assign summer projects to its students. These projects are mean't to keep students' minds refreshed on materials they have learned in school. Projects designed by students and teachers are different and can show many different views. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers are well equipped to teach in their field.

Students are are more creative than teachers and have the option of making their project easier for other students. Most students attempt to stay with the latest trends in school, which means some students can have a similar mind set as each other and can receive an easy project to complete. But not all students are prepared or knowledgeable to create a project that will teach other students what they need to know. For example, if a student creates a project based on a game or sport, the other student may not know anything about it and will have to put more effort in. Or if a student creating a project gives unclear instructions, students attempting to do the project may incorrectly complete it. Student-created projects could be easier for other students, but some students will either know nothing on the topic given to them, or ,if given vague instruction, will unintentionally fail the project due to a misunderstanding.

Teachers have gone through proper education in school, they have majored in their subject and know more than the average person. Teachers take advanced classes in order to learn more about their subject. Teachers have studied about their subject and specialize in containing the knowledge in order to teach students what they know. Teachers learn in deeper understanding of the topics that are taught to them and should be able to come up multiple ways to teach what they have learned to their students. After teachers have completed required classes, they will earn a bachelor's degree to show that they are verified to start teaching. Even after finishing their required courses, teachers can still take extra classes to expand their knowledge to teach their students and help them understand more in the future. Teachers are properly educated and will teach students what they know so that students are able to comprehend the information and utilize it in the future.

Teachers must be trained and prepared to teach their students in a way where their students can be engaged and gain the material that is taught to them. Teachers are taught to express interest in their work and to their students so that the students are more willing to learn the material from their teachers. For example, if a teacher shows no interest or enthusiasm, students also may not be interested or enthusiastic about learning the subject. Teachers should learn what is fascinating about their subject to teach their students in a way where they will keep interest and learn. Teachers should be engaging with their students and stay on topic so that students will take them seriously, even though this may not be something that is taught to teachers, it is still very important because it will show how much teachers care about their students and their subject. Teachers are well prepared and trained to deal with students and teach them in a way where they will be interested and engaged in their work.

Teachers are well educated and prepared to teach students, they are always willing to learn more from their students and fellow teachers. If teachers learn more from their students, future students will benefit from their teacher, understanding more than previous students. For example, if a student happens to gain knowledge about something their teacher didn't know and applied it in their project, the teacher would learn from their student and could apply it to their teaching or use it for next generation of students. After teaching in their classes, teachers may go out and continue taking advanced classes to further their education even more, so that they can be prepared to answer questions from students, or give them advice so that they will learn and understand to use what they've learned. Teachers are are prepared and educated to teach students, but there is no harm in learning more in their field to teach students new, useful material that they have acquired. Teachers, despite their education, can always learn something new from their students.

Teachers are well prepared to handle students in many ways because of their education, training, and their ability to continue learning. Teachers will know what to teach to their students and how to express the information while engaging with their students without having them lose interest. Teachers will continue to learn from their fellow teachers and students to teach future students the new material that they have learned. Teachers have learned enough to be verified to begin teaching others on their subject. If this is a debate in your school area, write a letter to them on your opinion and why you've decided on that choice.
