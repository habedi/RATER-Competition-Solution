The Facial Action Coding System or known as "FACS" is a software that 3-D prints the picture exactly how it is with all the 44 major muscles that are identical to the person in the picture. From there it goes to psychologists and they classify the type of emotion that they see in the 3-D model. The psychologists refer to the six classified basic emotions which are Hapiness, Surprise, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness.

Having this in a classroom would be a cool idea but in my opinion i think there is no need for something like this in a classroom. The students may find it interesting but it wont teach them anything unless they are studying to be a psychologist or something related to that. The students may or may not like this but if they do come out with something like they were talking about when they said an ad popped up and the computer sees yout frown and puts a similar ad on the screen the computer will recongize that you are getting bored or not liking that so the computer would change the type of ad. If they come out with this then i can see it being used in the schools where students can learn what makes them mad or happy.

When it comes to "FACS" in the classroom it might not be the best option for students to learn about that unless they want to have a career similar or like a psychologist they should keep the "FACS" to the people who made it to make technological improvements and release it to people who would need this to help patients and then release it to students who are in college or a type of school that have students who want to be a psychologist or to people like video game designers who need this to make better improvements to characters int the games they are creating.
