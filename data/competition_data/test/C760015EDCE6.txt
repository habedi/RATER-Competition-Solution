We could be closer than ever exploring the planet called Venus. Nasa is thinking of ideas every day of how to overcome the obsticals Venus gives us. Venus is a "neighbor" right around the corner. Venus is a very harsh planet that might be explorable in the near future.

Venus is a very hard planet to get any information on. Everytime Nasa sends a spacecraft to get information it is harmed by the planets conditions. The text shows, "Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."

Venus has some simularites to earth. The planet nicknamed "Evening Star" may have once been like the most Earth planet. For example, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."

Venus is a very harsh planet that might be explorable in the near future. Venus is the neghboring planet that might be another planet that Nasa can some information on. Venus may have a ton of hardships but in the near future it may be another planet we "explored".
