If someone invited you to become a Seagoing Cowboy would you go or not? I know for a fact that I would take the invitation and go. I mean there are pros to this. There also cons.

There are so many opportunities to go explore the world. These are one of them. You would get to visit China, Europe, Greece, and many other places too. This is a chance for you to communicate with the rest of the world that you haven't seen or probably heard of yet.

Now to the cons, this is also the end of this because I know you WILL go. The one and only con there is that I know of is that you would miss your friends and family. I mean, to you there are probably other cons. To me, I only have one con. So, would you take the invitation to become a Seagoing Cowboy?
