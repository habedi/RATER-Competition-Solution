Driverless cars will be the newest editiion to our generation. Some people are against the idea of them, others, are impressed with the idea. The cars are durable enough to, drive on their own without any hazards in the way, warn you of an emergency that is ahead of you, the cars are able to use sensor technology to add onto the left rear wheel of a car and the car includes many feautures such as, a rotating sensor roof, a video camera (mounted near the rear view mirror), four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.

I agree with the idea of the driverless cars because of the safety that the car will provide for the people. For example: if the driver is injured and needs to be taken to an emergency room, the car will be able to drive there safely and the driver would be able to recieve help. Driverless cars are not fully driverless still, they acquire human help when anything comes into their way, the allow the driver to take control of the wheel when there is a mishap of some sort.

A major question asked, is the car driving or assisting humans? The answer is simple, the car, as of now, is only assisting humans. If the car were driving, it wouldn't need any of the drivers help when it came to a bump or an accident in the road. When we think of driving, we tend to think that there is a driver who is holding the wheel and not sitting back and relaxing. Driving is in fact a stressful thing. Most drivers get to worked up to think about what is happening. This is another example as to why the car is good, it will help with driving anxiety.

Whether the car is in favor or not, it will always be an idea that we knew made an impact of the world. The car is durable, smart and flexible when it comes to driving itself. The major problem would include the cost. If the car isn't driving now, when will it?
