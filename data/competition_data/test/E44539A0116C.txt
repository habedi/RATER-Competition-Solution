if you do choose to do this policy you are making the biggest mistake of you life i think. most students make a c average so why would you go against the majority of the school? if you make this change you a are taking away future HISTORY do u understand? lets say the best middle school athletic in the country makes a c average. you have just spoiled the chance of not just his dreams of becoming a national football player but his FAMILIES. he could have supported the city giving so much money to the homeless but NO. he is not good enough for YOU because he didn't meet you PERSONAL OPINION?!?!?!?!?!? that's non sense!!!! what if god had his future planned out for him to break all the record in the BOOK! be the best athlete in the WORLD!! but he couldn't because he didn't meet YOUR standerds???!!! that's your personal opinion.... just because you think that doesn't mean that everybody else thinks that too! that decision could change Americas history! (sports wise)
