Luke Bomberger wouldn't have seen how fun life was if he didnt graduate highschool. He had a good life and even better when his freind Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Right when they started to leave to europe world war 2 ended. They had arrived August 14 the day the pacific war ended.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means he could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay.

Luke had to take care of all the horses it was his job. It was no big deal though when he was a little kid his aunt made him work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case he did work in a farm in future and look he is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip he was a night watchman. All he had to do was check on the animals every single hour.

Luke loved being a Seagoing cowboy it was more than he ever wanted. He had some scary moments but you have to face some fear. He was very scared when he almost fell off a cargo ship but a metal peice saved his life. Luke would find some time to have his own time and talked to the animals.
