Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that you should keep the grade average at a C. I don't play sports, but I do attend the games and to be honest i think that it would be fair to keep the average at a C, just because of the simple fact that some subjects aren't easy for some students like they are for others. For example, I'm not doing that well in science, as a matter of fact I have a C in science at the moment. I do plan on trying my best to get that grade up, but if someone who was really good at a specific sport got kicked off the team because they had a C in one or more of their classes, more than half of the people who attend games or play sports here wouldn't be very happy.

My opinion is that if you change the grade average to a B people would stop coming to watch the games because some of the best players who put up a good fight wouldn't be there to help them win or we would just stop winning period, then sports would basically be nothing. Some people have their life revolving around sports, it would be less of a hassle if we continued to leave the sports area alone unless its a major problem. My thoughts about this are very strong and I'm sticking with this opinion until someone gives me a reason not to. I would love to continue going to sports events and supporting our school, but only if you kept the grade average at a C so that some of out best players could stay on the teams, and try our best to defeat whoever is in our way of winning. Thanks for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
