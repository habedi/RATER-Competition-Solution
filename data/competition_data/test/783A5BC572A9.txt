Dear Principal,

I think that students should be required to do community service. If they would perform to do community service there would be no trash anywhere and it would look clean. It would be nice because it would be clean. No one would like see a dirty place, street, school, and stores. The reason why I'm telling you this is so you could understand what I am trying to say. It would be awesome if you made a program that has community service for people that would like to pick up trash and go to peoples houses and try to convince they to not litter. Also there has been recycle bins coming in and there has not been that much recycle coming in its like people just walk by and think that it is a trash can. We also need people to throw away trash in trash cans and recycle in the recycle bin .

We should print out papers talking about keeping areas clean at all times and have them call your cell phone number to see if they would like to join us clean around dirty areas. My point is that we should keep everything clean. We should have teachers that inspire kids that want to keep there schools clean. You should make a program named healthy cleaners. So you should think about everything I told you in this letter. Thank you for all of your help!

Your student
