First of all, you get to take care and learn about the animals there. Some people might not like the fact that you have to stay in a boat several weeks with the animals. But after taking care of them and feeding them its not that bad and they become your friends. I had to feed them and water the animals two or three times a day. The stalls where the horses were kept also had to be cleaned. Not only do you learn to take care of the animals but you also learn responsibility.

Secondly, you have a lot of fun. I get that some people think being stuck in a boat isn't fun at all. Some of the most fun was when the animals were unloaded so the return is one of the funnest parts. The cowboys played many games and sports where the animals were housed. They would have volleyball games, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, all which helped pass time. Go try it, who doesnt like an advanture, and some new friends?

Lastly, you get to experience so many unique places. I understand that some people might not want to leave their home. But, I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China. Another one of the coolest things was the Acropolis in Greece. I got to do many things like taking a gondola ride in Venice, Itay a city with streets of water. I saw many things and went to lots of places just imagen everywhere you could go and everything you would discover if you gave it a chance.
