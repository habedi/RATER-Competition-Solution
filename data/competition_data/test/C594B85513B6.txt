Do you want to be stressed out because you're trying to focus on two things? Not me! I would not be able to sleep at night.

If you raise the bar to play sports to a B grade average, almost half of the school will not be playing sports. Also I don't think that's a good idea because a student is bound to start lacking in school or sports.

I'm sure that you don't want to have a school full of kids that are going to get stressed out because they're trying to focus on school when really he or she is supposed to be practicing for a sport. Just think about it for a moment. You would be hurting many students dreams of becoming a famous sport player, but they can't because they did not have enough time as a child to practice. For instance, say their is a kid that is very talented in sports and has a strong chance of getting a scholarship. But the student grades are average.

Sadly, the student does not have a B average and can't participate in the sport that he wants to play. Now you would've ruined his chance of ever becoming a famous sport star.

Lastly, students will not be able to have fun in school. If you want a B grade point average you must work hard. That means sleepless night of studying. Do you want you're students to come to school dragging and falling asleep in class because they had practice and a lot of studying to do. But see why this could an good idea. For example, it may be a student that is a talented sport player, but all he want is a

C grade point average so that he could play sports. This means that student will not be trying as hard as he should. What you should is when a sport season is about to start, go to all the students teacher and see how much effort the student gives. That ladies and gentlemen would be a good idea.
