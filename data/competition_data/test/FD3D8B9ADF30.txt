Dear: Principal

I think that the kids of your school should be able to participate in any sport only if there is a physical on record. The students should have good grades yes but they should be able to have fun at school as well and if you say the we cant play sports until are grade average is at 80% or above that means that some people will be able to play and even then they will have trouble with there grades and they'll be kicked off the team. Some kids might actually make even lower grades and some people will still keep a C average and it is not fare to them when they cant play sports even with a physical on record and there going to mad at you so they join in any sports at all they'll just keep doing what they've been doing for the last couple years and they wont care about grades any more because even if there grades are good and they sign up for sports lets say football they will have to get a physical in order to participate.

Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
