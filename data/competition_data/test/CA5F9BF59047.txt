Dear Principal:

I believe you should go with Policy 2. When students bring cell phones to school they use them during down time in class. They text while teachers are talking. This can disturb the learning environment. Students will be distracted by texts they get and will want to respond. They can also pretend to be doing work and be on their phones. There is no way to enforce the rule of having cell phones to school.

Also, with cell phones in school; rumors spread around faster. This can harm a student's reputation. Cyber bullying can also take place. If the students have the resources around them to do it, they will.

Lastly, i believe no cell phones should be in school because it makes teachers jobs harder. They have to teach and watch for phones. It also makes learning harder for students. They become distracted from learning. It can lower test grades; which can make school funding go down.

Students being distracted, teachers on the lookout, and possibly lower test grades is why no cell phones should be allowed in school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
