The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers when according to Venusian geology,like erupting volcanoes,powerful earhquakes,and frequent lightning strikes can land on its surface. Also when gumans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any palnet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to our sun. An example that explains this is "On te planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet". Another detail that supports that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is the planet has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features sach as valleys,mountains,and craters. Also Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit and seems indisputable. An example is "The value of Venus seems indisputable,but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive". Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions. At thirty-plus miles above the surface,temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. It may not be easy conditions,but survivable for humans. Also,Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safety far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Mny researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough on Venus. An example that supports this is "Therefore,scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

An explanation of the evidence of why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because,Venus is the hottest planet and it is difficult to understand the different despites of many risks. Also when simplified electronics that is made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and has lasted over for three weeks. An example that supports this is "NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions". One way Venus can not be worthy of despite of the dangers is by looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and can make calculations by using gears,levers,and do not require electronics at all. Also if you use a phone or tablet to acis or heat capable of melting tin,then those systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure,heat,and other forces. An example is "Modern computers are enormously powerful,flexible,and quick,but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions".

Some ideas that show that Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the dangers when it is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth. also Venus is referred to Earth's twin. An example is "These differences is speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner". Also,each previous mission was unmanned,and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. It also explains that the spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Long ago,Venus was covered largely wih oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth. A final Example is "If our sister planet is so hospitable,why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface". Finally,when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.
