Dear principal,

You are faced with a tough decision about the cell phone policy at our school. I am writing to you to help you make a decision. There are two different policies that you can chose from. I personally believe that you should choose policy one. In this letter I am going to explain why I think you should chose policy one.

Foremost students would enjoy school a lot more than normal. They would be able to text their friends while on the bus instead of yelling what they were trying to say.

Secondly they wouldn't have to sneak phones into school and text underneath their desks during class. They would me more attentive during class. As a result they would get higher scores on tests and would be more likely to get an A or a B.

Thirdly students would not get up from their lunch table and go to their friend lunch table to talk to each other. It would also result in a quieter lunch room because less people would be talking.

Finally thank you for reading my letter to you. I hope you make the right choice and have a good day.

Your student,
