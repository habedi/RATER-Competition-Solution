"Less Cars"

"Vrroooom Vroooom," that is all that people hear when they step outside in the city along with honks and angry people, and police chasing people speeding. What if that was not what you had to hear all the time? What if that sounds would only be heard once every few hours or days? Thus can be a reality with limitation of car usage; people would be happier, there would be less smog in the sky, the global health would go up.

With less cars comes less trouble. in Andrew Selsky's artical "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota," he states " millions of Colombians Hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work tduring car-free day" this caused the "streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." Because of the car-free day there were less people on the road, less traffic, and less stress about getting to work. When there is no one driving and almost everyone is taking bikes or walking, it seems like it would make small sidewalks congested; it does not, because, as Andrew Selsky says, "throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..." This helps make transit even easier and less hectic. In Elisabeth Rosanthal's artical, "In German Suburb, Life Gose On Without Cars," she asked someone in a car-less community how they felt about not having a car, she said "'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'" People are happier without cars and without the stress that comes with them. Having less cars would also make places less polluted.

With less cars there would be less pollution in the air and less greenhouse gases that we would emit as a society. In Robert Duffer's artical, "Paris bans driving due to smog," he states that " after days of near-record pollution" in Paris the city officials "enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air opf the globay city. In Paris action was only taken when the smog made carrying out their day difficult, instead of before it got to that point. Some might say that if the imediate threat had not been there none of the citizens would have lisened to the ban; but they might listen to the banning of cars now that they see how bad it can get. In Bogota, Andrew Selsky states that "the goal [of the Day Without Cars] is to promote alternitive transportation and reduce smog." This helps the enviroment and the people living there, especially those with asthma; and those with heart disease can develop better exercise habits.

With less cars means more walking and less greenhouse gases. Many of the people that do not choose to ride the bus or a taxi, as Andrew Selsky says, "hiked, biked" or "skated. This means that these people were exercising and getting fit, even if it was just one day. Imagine if it was not just one day though; what if car-free day was car-free week, or month. This would decrease obesity in children and adults, along with lowering the hisk for heart contitions. Car-free weeks or months would make the enviroment better but also make it better for people with asthma. Less smog would mean people with asthma would be able to breathe easier in places like New York. Improving the health of people on a global scale.

Limiting car usage would be an amazing thing if it was on a global scale. Car-free days once every year are a great start to improving the planet. Car limitation would mean happier people, less pollution in the sky, and an improved standard of living. Less cars equal a better planet for every one.
