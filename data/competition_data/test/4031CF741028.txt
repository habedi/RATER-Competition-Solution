The question of, "should the development of these cars should continue or not" is actually a pretty good question. The fact that this is fairly new and raises some questions like, "will is be safe, will it be better to use than a regular car, and how far in development can this actually provide us with?" We can really predict the futuce, but we can be able to know what might happen based on what we know right know.

Google, and most likely other car maker company, are trying to make this driveless car a reality. But how will they go about doing this? First, it's good to mentioned that it is not yet completely driverless. It runs with sensors and cameras to see the area around it, along with GPS to guide it where ever you want to go. Comes with many other things that is "to minic the skill of a human at the wheel". Why is that important? That's important because that's what makes the car to be driverless. They have. Basic idea and model and it works perfectly fine. It mentioned, "their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash" and they are still finishing the final product. More things are going to be added on to make sure it is 100% safe to be in.

Is it better than a person? Well i think that it could become better than a human driver. Humans can crash into things all by accident, just because they went to fast or press the gas on fowards instead if backwards. Many things can happen on the driver's fault. Minus any accident outside of control, like a tree had fallen down on your car, the driverless in theory could serve as a way to decrease crashes or accidents. If it works the way it should, the mostion sensors and cameras could detect things and hit the brakes before anything happens. Although it isn't completely driverless, meaning it mentioned in the article, "they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but are desIgned to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills" and even if it isn't yet completely driver less, when the designers and creators finnally make it for there is not need for human assistants, the car could theoretically be safer than a human driver. Did you accidentally ran your car to someone else's? The driverless car sure didn't. Did you fall into a hole you didn't see? The driverless saw that from GPS and sensors p and avoided it already. Just things that can enhance the car to make it safer to be holding a baby or really elderly person in.

Why is this good for us? Well, imagine that the world is now use to this "driverless car" and is safest thing because of it's enhancers. People could hop in one and go anywhere knowing that they will be safe and arrive safetly. It is just more convinant to have, when being on auto-poilet, you can do anything you wish like calling someone when needed to, play games on a screen that could be provided, any more entertainting things that destract you with the boring, yet safe, ride. It it mentioned "some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and infirmation systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."

The idea of having a driverless car is actually a great idea once you think about it. With many upgrades and remodels, the car can and will be safe to use. It can be better than a normal human driver, and the options and things it can do to give us during the ride is a lot more than a person driving himself. This car will be the best thing that could happen to the roads and transportation.
