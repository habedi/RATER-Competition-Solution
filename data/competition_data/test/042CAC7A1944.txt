The car is one of the most important inventions, but it's taking so much in our life style

The car is one of the most important inventions on the human history, they give us a big adventage in the second world war, and after that, they do our life more easier, because with they we can travel big distances and be fast in other places like work or malls etc, but in the actuality is so nessesary.

In the "world of today" the cars are an obligation to everyone, because the people can't go walking to every site because today all the paces are so far from our houses, the people who lives in the suburbs just can't go to anywhere walkin they need a car or take the public transport, so they need other way to go anywhere without a car, like in the city of Vauban Germany, the people in Vauban goe's to the soccer games to the mall leave theyr childs in the school and everithing whitout a car!, the people in Vauban don't have a car because it's so expensive have one, in Vauabn if you want a house with a parking site you need to pay $40.000 dollars!, that's so much money and as a result of this the 70% of the Vauban's families don't have car, and a 57% of this families sold his car.

As a result of the experiment in Vauban's, the suburb's goes more small and more closely to everything doing the people more happy with this new life style, maybe we can lear something with this people.
