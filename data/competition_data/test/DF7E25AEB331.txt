Dear principal,

I heard that you were considering to change the average grade allowed for sports from a C to a B. While you might think it is a good idea, I do not. The majority of students have a C average in our school. There are many reasons to keep the average grade for sports a C. Many students might feel discouraged, some will feel pressured, and they might also feel left out.

Students will feel discouraged because of their grades. Some students feel proud of their grade of a C. If the grade average for sports changes to a B, those students will feel like they are not good enough for being on their school team. Then parents will start complaining to the principal, you. Some students live for sports and will be horrified by the new grade average. keep those students in mind, please. With the new grade average , what if students start giving up on school because it is more challenging?

Since the grade average will be higher, less students will want to try out for our teams. I think that will be embarrassing for the school. The other middle schools in our district will laugh at us. Sports are important because we need our students to participate in sports to prepare for high school.

Students will feel left behind with the new average for sports. Since they can not play, but their smarter friend can. Especially if a student is the only one who can not make it from his or her friends. It would be a disaster if not enough students meet the new requirements.

Principal, I can only try to convince you and I hope I have succeeded . I do not think the requirements you are considering are fair. Think of all of your students who really like sports.

Sincerely,
