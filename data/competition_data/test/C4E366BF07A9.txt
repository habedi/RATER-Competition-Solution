Dear principal,

This is STUDENT_NAME. I think that cell phones should be allowed to be used during lunch and passing periods, but not in class. I think this because there is nothing else to do during those times and you can keep in contact with your friends/ parents. Also you can use it to see if your going to be late. There a good reasons and bad reasons why we should be allowed to have cell phones at school and that is the good reason.

I can see why having cell phones is bad to have at school. First of all, people are going to be tempted to text or prank call in the middle of class. This is bad because it disturbs the learning of the person your texting and also you. Then you might not know the answers to the test and fail. That is one bad reason to let cell phones in school.

The next bad reason to let cell phones in school is because they can be lost and stolen. If it falls out of a kids pocket, they can loose or break it. Also if some kid gets pick pocketed, they might never get the phone back. That is a bad thing that could happen.

The last reason why it is bad is that some kids might text each other answers in class. And they will pass the test. But that does not show what the kid learned. They just cheated and will never know what the answer is later on in life.

Although there is more reasons why not to have a cell phone in school, i still think you should be able to. You might not know something important that someone told you. Then you will get in trouble. If you catch someone texting or using their phone in class, you can just take it away so they will stop using their phones.

This is why cell phones should be allowed in school.
