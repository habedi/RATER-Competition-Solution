Students can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows you to work at your own pace without being rushed, you can always work ahead of time if needed and you are always able to go back to a lesson if you didn't fully understand it the first time.

The feeling of being rushed on an assignment is never easy and can cause frustration and stress. Taking online classes allows you to work at your own pace and gives you as much time as needed before the assignment is due. Not only does being rushed prevent you from understanding the lecture given, but also doesn't let you take the information in as needed to understand it. Many students are not able to fully get the hang of a certain topic without the teacher moving onto the next topic. Learning new material and understanding it 100% takes a different amount of time for everyone. Online schooling allows you to review the material for as long as needed. It also gives you the opportunity to work at your own pace and even allows you to work ahead of time if you wanted to.

Some students move at a faster pace then others when it comes to learning new material. Online schooling not only gives you as much time needed, but also allows you to work ahead. For example say you wanted to go ahead and complete your assignments for the next day, you would be able to do so. Working ahead of time can benefit you in a lot of ways. One being if you know you won't be able to complete your assignments tomorrow, you would be able to go ahead and get them completed. Turning assignments in ahead of time can also prevent you from getting behind on your work as well. Being able to work ahead also gives you enough time to go back and redo a lesson if not understood fully the first time.

Something that occurs often in public schools is that the teacher is moving onto new material before some students are even able to fully understand the material that they had just gotten the hang of. This can not only become irritating, but can also build up to create a disaster with some. Every student learns at a different pace and some teachers don't put that into perspective. Some students can have something learned in a week whereas others it may take even two weeks. The main key to being successful is to take your time and focus on one thing at a time. Online schooling allows you to go back and relearn something at your own pace compared to learning it with a teacher one on one. This is something that teachers should take into consideration more often and try to prevent from happening.

Students can benefit from online schooling and being able to attend classes from home in many different ways. This allowing the student to work at a steady pace and get assignments completed at their own pace. Online schooling takes a lot and you should be very determined and dedicated to your school work if wanting to do online classes. It is not something you should take for granted because whereas public school if free, online schooling is not. Online schooling may not be everyone's path but for some it could help out a lot.
