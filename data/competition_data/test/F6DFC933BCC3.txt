Principle TEACHER_NAME,

As a student that participates in sports, I know how myself and the other athletes feel about the new academic standards. Many students have been working on raising their grades, and this can be achieved only if time is allowed. I understand that this school strives for academic excellence, but students also need exercise and after-school activities in order to succeed in and out of school.

Students have learned how to make time for studying and sports, and have kept to the previous standard of an overall C average. I believe many of these students' grades would drop if they did not have to keep to those standards. They might also drop if the students weren't also challenged in other ways. My fellow students agree that we can all keep a B average, but should not be penalized right away due to the short notice of this change.

Raising a grade does not happen over night. These students will still be studying as much as possible, and doing their absolute best on all assignments as usual. Of course, tests can be weeks apart. The school should have a testing period before they decide the new policy is the official one. During this period, no student should be penalized.

Sports keep students focused. If you suspend the student from an extra-curricular that he/she loves, the student won't be trying to learn, they will be trying to memorize enough to barely pass. By accepting that students can achieve the acceptable average while still playing with their team, both parties will be happy in the end. Especially while this new standard is still being thought out.

The athletes believe they should be allowed to keep the C average standard for the rest of the 2010-2011 school year. If the school board still in the end decides to make their new standards the official policy, the students will be coming in with a new attitude on the first day.

The school's standards have been effective for some time, each student graduating and moving on to exceptional high schools; some even with sports scholarships! Why would the school want to change a good thing? Our school has pride due to academic, religious, social, and sporting excellence. By allowing students to work at their own pace, the school will be able to keep their high standards and reputation.

Please consider this proposal because it comes from the core of the school - from the students themselves. They know that it is possible to keep to academic standards while participating in something they love. By working together and hearing all sides of the argument, I am certain that a final decision can be arranged; one in which all parties are happy.

Thank you for all of your time and consideration,

John Doe,

Student and Athlete of SCHOOL_NAME
