I never thought that I would end up being a Seagoing Cowboy, but I am and I'm glad. In this writing I'm gonna tell you why you should try to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

The first reason why I think you should join is because you get to help people. Going to those different countries made it so much more clear of their needs. Their country was left in ruins. They need everything that we do or more.

The second reason why you should join the program is because you get to take care of animals. When I got asigned to that job it kind of reminded me of my aunt Katie's farm. I would go over there when I was a boy and help out.

The last reason I think you should join the program is because you get to travel! Yeah there are some dangers like when the captain slide down a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs but the sights make up for it. I remeber when I got to see Europe and China, so pretty. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece and that topped it all.

That's why I think whoever is reading this should join the program and become a Seagoing Cowboy. You get to help people, see the world, and take care of loving animals. Just think maybe you'll see me there.
