Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think Community Service is very important in the world today. Community service is a way to help out the community in any way it needs, Some communities like mine for example are really bad. It has trash everywhere and abandon houses on every corner. I try to help my community in the best way i can by not littering an cleaning up the messes that's there.

Community service is also a good way to get into college. College is a very important thing to accomplish in life. College determines the life you would set for yourself in the future. To get into college you have to perform many hours of Community Service. This helps show that you are a good person in the world and want to make the world a better place.

If students in our school perform Community Service i' m sure that they will see what change they have made in our society. If students perform service to others outside of school they might be willing to help others inside school. Students can perform services like visiting and helping elders at a nursing home, planting community gardens in their neighborhood, or even helping out a shelters or hospitals. They would see the change they made an know they became a better person.

Our school could even hold a fundraiser or event to see which top three (3) students can perform the most community service hours in a certain amount of time and they could even win a prize. Lots of kids would participate an our school would have made or community a better place.

Sincerely, Your 8th grade student
