Dear Principal,

I have heard you are requiring for all students to perform some type of community service. There are those who think community service is great and very important, but there are also those who think it will waste their time and keep them from doing something more important to them. Some students have already done some community service and others refuse to do so. Let me tell you why I think you should continue with your plans to require everyone to perform community service. Community Service should be done by everyone because it helps the community itself, it helps each one become a better person, and it gives a better chance for those who plan to go to college.

Doing community service means doing something for the people in the community or doing something to help the community itself. Performing community service would help people everywhere. A type of community service is to pick up litter and if it were performed by some hundreds of students, then our streets would be cleaner and our environment would be safer. People would have to breathe in more clean air without the garbage scattered everywhere on our grounds. It would also help out animals who have died from the filth at their habitats.

Performing community service will also help each one become a better person. We'll become nicer people who are more involved with our society. We would become kinder seeing how every plan to help makes everyone else happy. It will open our eyes to see how helping others also helps ourselves. Everyone would be a more respectable, kinder person than before. It would make us more helpful.

With community service required from every student, everyone would have a better chance of receiving scholarships during high school. Community service is greatly demanded from every university/college and starting from an early age, we would make ourselves get a better opportunity. Those who thought they wouldn't get as good a chance because of their grades could now see they do while doing community service. Those who had the grades to get in have an even better chance with the requirement of community service.

Many would complain and tell you not to require community service of them because they say it will waste the time they could've used to do something more important to them. Well, let me tell you that is not true. If someone is organized, which we all should be, then one can plan their schedule nicely to do what they seem as important to them and still do some community service. It is not a waste of time nor does it keep anyone from doing their other regular activities.

So you see, you really should require community service to us students. I highly agree with you on this. It will help the community we live in, it will help us become better people, and it will get us a better opportunity to a college we would like. Don't let those who think community service is a waste of time change your mind. Go right ahead with your plan, it will only make us better.
