Recently I was assigned an essay in my English class but I couldn't find the motivation to work on it. I was trying to focus but it proved to be very difficult since I wasn't interested in the topic I was writing about. Students should be able to design their summer projects because it allows them to choose a topic they are passionate about and also promotes out of the box thinking.

If a student designs their own project they are more passionate about the subject. When it comes to projects it is challenging for students to find the drive to complete the task. If they are able to pick a topic then passion will drive them and their overall performance will improve.

Motivation is the key to being a successful student and allowing kids to design their own projects is an amazing way to motivate them.

Out of the box thinking is difficult for the modern student due to teachers having to follow a strict curriculum. These students are learning the material to pass a test, not because they are interested in the subject. When a student is given freedom to learn on their own terms and design their own project it promotes creativity and allows them to find the joy in learning. This gives students a positive outlook on learning and allows them to dig deeper into their subject of choice.

While some people think having a teacher designed project is better because it provides structure for students, this is false because most students are starting to rely on that help and aren't able to use their critical thinking skills. When kids are given too much structure it makes it harder for them to think on their own and in the real world they are going to need those skills. If students don't develop these life skills it puts them at a disadvantage when they go to start their career. In the workplace, there is not always going to be someone who can hold your hand and walk you through a project.

Overall, students should be able to design their own projects because it helps them build critical life skills, like out of the box thinking, and it also gives them a chance to be passionate about learning.
