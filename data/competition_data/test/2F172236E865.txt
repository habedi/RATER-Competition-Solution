I think students should be aloud to play with a C average. Because changing it a B average not many kids would be able to participate in sports.

I think you should let them play with a C average. It gives them a better chance of being able to play, and when they are playing the sport they are being active, which is always good. If you keep it to a C average, you'll also have more kids participating in other activities with the school. You would have a lot more student council students and drama, and any other activity that would have to do with the school. When they are in student council they are planning for the school, that could help the school to. If you keep it to a C average, a lot more kids would be eligible to play and participate which would also mean that kids are more involved with the school. You would also have a bigger selection of kids to choose from when picking the teams.

If you change it to a B average, a lot of kids would not be eligible to play or participate. Since many of the students have a C average, it could be a good thing that you change it to a B average meaning that they would have to push themselves to be able to play or participate in any of the other activities. But, it could also be very bad, considering most a the students have C averages, you would not have a lot of students participating or playing anything at the school. I do not think it would be fair for you to change it to a B average, because many of the students don't have that.
