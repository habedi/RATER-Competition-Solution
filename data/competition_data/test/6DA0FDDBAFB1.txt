Unreal Theories & Magazine Believings

I believe the face on mars is a natural landform. I believe this because, in a few paragraphs, they say that it can't be possible and that they took a picture and that wasn't the case. My three examples from the text are in paragraph 11, paragraph 7, and paragraph 9. The face on mars is a landform, and i could prove it to you.

In paragraph 11 it shows that this so called "face" is actually not a real face. It says in paragraph 11, "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see wat they were". I think that this "fact" is actually kind of unreal. For example, if you take a picture of the sun, and you make the picture 3 times bigger than that size, you wont see how the real sun looks because the picture doesnt have all the good pixels you need to get a perfect picture. Its almost to never when someone has a perfect picture and you can see every detail of the picture.

In paragraph 7 it states "Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared in a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all". Thats one of the best examples i have so far because, if they went up to mars to check out if this face was real or fake and it ended up to be fake, AND they have proof, of course its not going to be real. some people still believe that the face is still real as it says in paragraph 8. Some people were so anxious to have the answer, that they started to have theories about the planet. as it says in paragraph 8,"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze". If anyone has heard me, i have said SKEPTICS. They said that for a reason to let people know that answers is better than a hypoothesis.

My last example is from paragraph 9. In paragraph 9, it says that " Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. "We just don't pass over the Face very often," he noted".

They dont pass over the face very often because if you think about it, they just look straight down and scan the planet. The planet doesn't swirl on different sides. it stays in something that is called orbit. Orbit is something used for the plant to go in circles. it doesn't go everywhere like a regular sphere on earth, it has to stay in one place.

I believe that the Face isnt a real face, but actually a landform. I have chosen Those few examples to change your mind about how you feel about the Face, when, in all reality, its a landform. I believe I can change your mind about the feeling of knowing that this Face is a natural landform, most likely made by a meteor hitting the planet.
