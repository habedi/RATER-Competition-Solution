Summer assignments are a common way for schools to further student knowledge during the school break. Teachers usually compose a project using their perspective on what their students need. However, both generations are very different and students already have an idea of what approach would be best for them. Summer projects should be student-designed to allow customization specific to needs, include effective methods, and enhance the experience.

Every individual thinks and processes information differently and having a custom learning plan can be very useful. Having students design their summer project will allow them to focus on what only they need to learn more about. Teachers aren't the most adept to what students need help with and only the student knows what they need work on. For example, this summer I was told to complete a pre-calculus review packet solely focused on one topic. I finished it with ease and was not able to brush up on certain topics such as logarithms or exponential functions that I actually needed to review for the upcoming year. This lack of preparation can make learning new material difficult because of the lack of foundation.

This generation of students is very technology-driven and if students were to design their assignment using a technology-based method it would promote effectiveness and comfort. Teaching methods have evolved over time from chalkboards and writing on paper to smart boardsÂ and typing on laptops. Children, teenagers, and even young adults are accustomed to these advancements and find them to be more effective methods for learning. If teachers were to design the summer project, the odds of a technology-based assignment would be slim. This is because they prefer old-fashioned techniques, which aren't necessarily better for their students.

Doing schoolwork over the summer isn't ideal for most students and having students design what they work on will increase interest. Allowing this project to be enjoyable can lead to a faster completion and a more memorable educational experience. For example, teenagers who enjoy reading books only enjoy the ones they select themselves. Their school-assigned books put a damper on their experience and lessens their motivation to read it or even comprehend its meaning. The goal of summer projects is to motivate students to learn and sometimes that takes extra flair and effort but it is worth it.

Customization is key when assigning summer projects. This is why it is so important for students to be given the ability to design it themselves. Allowing students the freedom to design their summer project is beneficial for their experience. Through their designs these summer projects can lead to better engagement for other students. Additionally, this project is a perfect way to take advantage of summer break and make students learn the best way possible.
