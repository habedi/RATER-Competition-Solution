Dear TEACHER_NAME,

March 1st 2

The first policy that you are considering, the one allowing students to have their cell phones during lunch period and free period and off during classes is the best policy to use. Students may need to use their cell phones to contact their parents, and there is little chance of the cell phones being miss treated.

Some students may need to contact their parents during school and it is hard to contact them without bothering the office. Some students may have forgotten books at home that they need or forgot their lunch. Also it is important for the students to know how they are getting home, if they are going by the bus or if they are getting picked up. By having cell phones it makes it easier for the student to contact their parents. Some students may not want to go down to the office and ask, which i know from experience, and if students were allowed to have their cell phones during free period or lunch period then they can contact their parents. If students were allowed to have cell phones with them then missed homework may be less of an issue. A lot of the time missed homework is because they left their stuff at home, if the students were able to have cell phones then less people would have missed homework. Also allowing students to use cell phones during free period or lunch period it would make it so the office doesn't have to worry about students needing to use the phone to contact home. The office would have time to deal with other things instead of students needing to use the phones to contact their parents.

A problem that cell phones may bring is that they are used to talk to other students or even cyber bullying. If the school had cell phones it wouldn't cause more problems. Their is no point in texting other students when they are near by and they can talk to them face to face. Our school is so small we don't need to use cell phones to contact other students because we have a small school.

Also the students really wouldn't be able to talk to students from different schools because they most likely have different lunch and free period time or don't allow cell phones. Cyber bullying is starting to become a big issue and cell phones would not cause more cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is more on chat websites and things like Facebook. Most cell phones don't have internet and if they do most of the time wifi is needed to use the internet. If the students don't have the wifi password that's not an issue.

Cell phones aren't a bad thing they can be used for good things too. I see that their is no reason to use cell phones during school unless the students need to contact my parents, which would not cause any problems. Also it would not cause more cyber bullying and the cell phones would mostly be used to contact their family.
