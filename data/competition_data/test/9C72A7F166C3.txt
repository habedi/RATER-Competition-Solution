In many states schools require students to complete a project over summer break. these projects should be teacher-designed because if students designed the project nothing will be beneficial for them, students could possibly make it not very challenging, and students would not have enough information to make a project.

If students designed the summer project it could possibly be nonbenificial to the student. for example, during the summer there are lots of actvites to do, lots of places to go, and lots of free time. students' time are occupied with hanging out,that the least thing on their mind is designing a project. if students design the project their will be a lack of information in the project, the project might not meet the requirements that the school would prefer.

if students design the project it could not be very challenging and very small because the students dont want all their time occupied by school. some may argue that if s student designs the project that it can possibly have the information that the students possibly don't know, but that is very unlikely because it is students' free time, no students wants to have work piled up to take their summer away.

Having a teacher design the project is much more beneficial for the students because the teacher have grades of test they have taken, giving the teachers a broad idea of what information should be on the project. Teachers know exactly what to require on the project, as well as what key points to make sure they go over so when the next school year starts,students' brains will already be soaking up information throughout that summer. it won't be new to them when the school year starts. usually without any project or learning tools set in pace during the summer, students brains will practically lose a majority of the information from the previous year, it is very important to have your brain always functioning as well as feeding it more information daily.

If students were to design the project, they could possibly not have the correct information on it, or just not enough information. one students education level should not be applied to the project because every students can know a little more, or know a little less of a subject and could use the practice. teachers should be required to design the project so it can be beneficial to the student, it can be a little challenging, just enough to get your brain functioning and really thinking, and so all the information provided is from a broad understanding of all the students weak spots, as well as their stronger spots.Â
