Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Do I think my peers should join community service? Yes, but they don't need to. Why do I say that they don't need to, because my ''friends'' don't need for someone to tell them if they should help out their community or not. Its only respectful to help out your elders when the need it, or to help out another buddy when trying to find a weapon in a video game. Right? And another reason is because kids don't like being told what to do or when to do it. I should know, because I am a kid. And if you force them to do it, it's only going to make the situation worse, and then there will be violence. And isn't that what we are trying to get rid of? I mean if you really want kids to help out the community just tell them, if someone needs or ask you for help stop and think, ''What if that was me needing help?'' And also people will think good of you and respect you. Because that's all kids want, is for people to respect them. But most of all they want to be someone. So i don't think that kids should join community service, they should do it for themselves.
