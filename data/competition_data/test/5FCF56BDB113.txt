Dear Principal,

I think that you should allow students to use their cell pones during their lunch and free time only.

I think this because kids work hard in school and should have a reward for that not just by receiving good grades.

Also, cell phones are how we can communicate with our friends and family.

If there is an emergency, how else would we know that if our cell phones are turned off during the day.

Another reason I think that kids should be able to have their cell phones during lunch and free time is because with our technology today, the cell phone is a major part of that and it can show us new ways to create things.

Someone in our school may be the next person to build a new innovation that can change the world and if we can experience technology at a young age then that can benefit us in the future.

Going back to my reason of why kids should be able to use their cell phone at school is because if we make good grades we want to be rewarded just like most people would but not just by grades.

If we can use our cell phones during free time that can also give us a chance to relax our brain and give it a chance to rest before going back to work again. This can be a reward for everyone.

If its our free time then we should be able to spend it the way we want it for the most part, so why not on our cell phone?

Also, if we have a family emergency how else would we know, especially if we are at school? Our parents would probably call or text us, but if we can't look at our cell phones or if they are turned off then how soon will it be before we can look and see?

I understand that some kids well take advantage of this new policy and that we happen we can't say that it won't, but that is what's going to happen with every situation.

We just have to make sure that doesn't happen to many students.

If they decide to use the privilege unwisely then they should be punished like every other person.

We can't make everyone perfect so we just have to help and fix the flaws that will come with this policy.

I think that this new policy will improve students grades because when they go back to a class they will have a more relaxed mind.

Also, they will have to make good decisions during free time on how to use it rationally.

If they decide to use it irrationally, then they have to face the consequence of their actions.

This will also make the students feel more grown up, mature, and responsible because they have to make choices for themselves.

This prepares them for the real world ahead of them.

In my opinion, this is the policy that we should take on as our own. I think this will benefit multiple people in our scenario, not just the kids, or not just the teachers.

Sincerely,

Your student
