Dear principal,

I have heard that you are going to make it to where you have to have a B average to participate in sports or other after school activities I am very displeased with this and I will give you reasons. My first reason is first of all most of the school's population are only at a C

average so most people may not do sports. Another is that the passing grade level in this district is a C so if you pass you can do sports and other after school activities. Also i' m not sure it is in your power to do this i believe the school board of this county can do that not individual schools.

Now this might cause students to work harder but most students will want to focus on their sport rather than grades so they will probably get only a C average. This means the entire team of all the sports will be kicked out so there will be no point if there is no one to play the sports. Now to recap most students only have a C average and will not be able to play sports if this policy goes through. Remember I am against this new B average policy.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
