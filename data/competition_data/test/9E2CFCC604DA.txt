Dear students,

I think that it is right for elementary school children to pick up there litter. In this letter i want to express that if you help pick up the litter it makes you a better person in heart and for you to say "no" to that is just terrible i know if someone would ask me if i wanted to pick up litter for them i would say "yes, I would because it keep's this place clean." But i do not think student's should be required to perform community service, yes it would be a good thing to help the area were u live but what if you have something to do or you have to be some where or need to do some for or with your family and friends i personally think that almost no body would want to do community service, probably in a room full of 20-25 people I think only about maybe 5 or 6 of the people in that very room would do it but the other 15 or 14 people wouldn't even try to see if they like it or if they feel good about it.

And as you know there has been many animal deaths because we don't pick up are trash or put it in a trash can we just drop it on the floor or ground, But say that you where a deer and you where really hungry and there was nothing to eat but when he spots a say Macdonald's rapper the deer would eat it the eventually be really sick or it could possibly die, And me, my sister RELATIVE_NAME

and my mother are in the Animal protection program "ASPCA" and we hate when people litter and we abolish it we want everybody to take that into consideration sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
