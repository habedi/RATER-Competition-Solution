Dear Principal,

I know you mean well changing the school policy but the grades at this school are not that good so very few kids will get to play sports and have there extra curricular activities. Almost every student has a C average or lower and changing the school policy will destroy our sports and other extra curricular activities.

I think there are other things you can do to get everyone's grades up. Like all the students who are getting good grades can tutor the kids with C averages or lower. At least give them a chance to get there grades up before you change the policy. Most of the kids in this school have great potential but just need to stop being lazy and start studying. A tutor or study hall will give everyone a chance to get there grades up.

I don't personally like sports but there are a lot of other kids that do and they are not going to like the policy change. Like I said before please give everyone a chance to get there grades up by finding a tutor to help them. There are some good kids in this school and I know that if they had the chance that they could get there grades up easily.

Some kids just aren't good at testing, or are lazy when it comes to homework and that's bringing there grades down. I don't like doing homework but in class I do all my work, its the homework that brings down my grades. That doesn't mean that I'm not smart it just means that I'm lazy, and I admit to that to. Less homework might be another way to get there grades up. Whatever you decide but I'm just asking you to give all the students in this school a chance.

Think about it,
