Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should allow phones to be brought to your school and used during free periods such as lunch and home room. The reason I see this as a reasonable policy is that you already say not to bring your phones to school but kids do and, they text during class anyway. I believe that if you were to put this policy into effect it would benefit the children's learning, make them get in less trouble, and improve their attitude towards school.

The reason that this policy would help kids learn is that they can text during free periods instead of secretly in the classroom. The kids won't pay attention in class if they are trying to text their friends. I believe letting kids text during free periods would make them stop texting in class because they can at some other time.

Also it would help them get in less trouble because kids bring their phones with them to school anyway. If they were allowed to use them at certain points during the day they would not get in trouble for texting in class because they wouldn't at all. Also taking away the "no phone rule" would make texting in class less fun so they would stop because it works the same way that somebody doesn't want to know something until it's a secret.

Texting in the free periods such as home room and lunch would help the student's attitude towards school. By letting children text at certain points during the school day they believe school isn't as bad. They would think that it is cool that their school is letting them text during school. They wouldn't dislike the teachers that tell them they can't text and, in turn, would try harder in school.

That is why when it comes to texting in free periods at school I think that it would help the students learn, make them in less trouble, and improve their attitude towards school.
