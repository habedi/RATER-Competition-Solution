I am for driverless cars, but i also think there is concerns with these driverless cars that need to be adressed before letting driverless cars roam the streets. Safety is a big concern to me about these driverless cars, these vehicles need to be equipped to the roads for complete safety of the people. I also think these cars should be owned by owners that know how and will use the cars correctly. Not only do these vehicles need to be quipped to the roads, the driver and the people of the area around these vehicles need to be aware that these driverless cars are on the road.

In paragraph nine, the concern of safety and who will be held accountable for any incidents is a major topic of discussion. These driverless cars will add to the problems in the community if we let these driverless cars on the roads. These vehicles need to equipped with technology that will break quickly, and know when to break or speed up according the situatiion. Sensors and any other type of gadgets to these vehicles need to be installed for complete safety.

These vehicles need owners that are aware of how to use the cars. I think that certain licenses need to be earned in order to drive one of these cars. If any accidents occur with these vehicles then the owner should be accountable for the accident.

I believe certain roads, signs, lanes, etc., need to be built in order for these cars to be successful. The people need to be aware of these vehicles so their children aren't vitcims of any accident by these vehicles. If these things are in any way built, I believe these cars can be successful.

In conclusion, I am for driverless cars. These vehicles could change the future in many ways. I believe with the proper enviornment that these cars can be very benificial to the people of the future.
