Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Many kids can get distracted by cell phones. The phones sometimes go off in class because a student does not turn the phone off or they forget to turn the phone off and the class gets disrupted. The cells phones will also cause students to get distracted from what they were suppose to do and then will get in trouble. The students will suffer consequences that could have been avoided if the cell phones were not allowed. Cell phones should not be allowed in school for these reasons.

Sometimes students will have their phones in their backpacks when it suddenly goes off. This disrupts the class because they will lose their attention to the teacher and look back to the student who owns the phone. It also might cause the teacher to forget what they were teaching because of the sudden disruption. The other students will get disrupted and not pay attention to the teacher and then they will not know what the teacher said. This would cause the student consequences and may get in trouble or not know some answers on a test.

Not only do cell phones disrupt class and students, but they also distract students from what they are doing. The students might be sent on an errand by a teacher and might start trying to text. The student might forget what they were suppose to do and get in trouble. If a student needed to quickly study last minute for a test and they receive texts then the student will get distracted. This might cause the student to not study and then get a bad grade or not do as well as they could have on the test.

Schools should not allow cell phones because the phones disrupt and distract kids. Students sometimes forget to turn the phone off when it goes off in class and the class will be disrupted. Other times students may need to do some quick last minute things when they get texts and then do not do what they needed to do. These reasons are why some students may get in more trouble because of their or someone else's phone. Cells should not be in school to avoid some consequences that the students might face for disrupting a class or getting distracted by their phone.
