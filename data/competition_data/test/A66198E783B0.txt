Dear TEACHER_NAME,

The debate in weather we should all be required to complete community service or not is a big decision to make. In my opinion we all should be required to have done some community service because it not only helps our community but it helps the students grow as people in society. This could be a chance for students to feel like they can make a big difference in such a little way. Also some students already perform community service on a daily basis and don't even know it. This could be a chance to show them what a big help they are as well as congratulate those students who do know they do community service on a daily basis. I think that community service can be a lot of fun if we know that we are doing it to help others and ourselves. This is a project that not only a few students can be incorporated with but the whole school can take part. Another great reason to include community service in our program at school is because it looks great on our high school transcript and for colleges to look at. This could help a lot of our students succeed in careers of there future and even making it into colleges of there choice.

Some examples of community service projects that the school could perform are tutoring, cleaning up the liter around school and on the sidewalks around town, raising money for a foundation or group in need, or even having a "big brother" program. These simple acts can make a huge difference in someone's life especially if they are in need of some care or just need someone there with them. I feel like when and if we do this we could have a great outcome in the attitudes of the students.

When you make this decision I encourage you to think about the great things that could come out of putting community service into the program. I deeply feel it could help many students. And I hope you can put that into consideration when you make the decision to put it in or not. Many students would be delighted to know that you are looking out for there futures by having them help other Thank you for the time you took to read this letter and hear my opinion on the situation.

Sincerely,

Student
