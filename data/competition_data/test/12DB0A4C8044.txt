In the article of the Mona Lisa smile, there is a new technology called Facial Action Coding System (FACS). It read Mona Lisa smile symply from a computer software and tells what percentage of their emotion she is in. According to the article this can give you any details of a person in paragraph 6 "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confured or bored." I actually think that is smart because any you cant see when a person is sad but they have a smile in their face. It tells you how they are feeling that exact time.

For instance humans perform the same emotion everyday either if you are happy or sad. In the article it says that they are "44 muscles just like human muscles" that can tell your emotion and the percentage of ur emotion. Sometimes they compared it to a real a nuetral face to see the difference. Or it can go the other way if the person in not smiling they can put a smile of its face.

In the article that FACS can create your status about how you feeling that day if your sad or happy. It explains that Mona Lisa that could be sad but still have a smiling.
