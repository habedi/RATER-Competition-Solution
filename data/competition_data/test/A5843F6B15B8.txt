In Nick D'Alto's writing of "Making Mona Lisa Smile" he talks about a computer software, developed by Thomas Huang, that can detect spacific muscle movements in order to identify diffrent emotions. Nick argues that this technology will be revolutionary to many aspects of life, such as education, film and video tech careers, and maybe even politics. I believe that this advancement should not be implamented into a school enviorment for three key reasons, it is an invasion of privacy, it doesn't provide any academic assistance, andI don't respect the idea of robbing next generations the right to interact with an actual human teacher at such a young age. For these three reasons I plan to despute why I disagree with Nick D'Alto about implameting this kind of software into education.

First, I disagree with Nicks idea because its an invation of privacy. Imagen that you were in elementary school again and this tech was installed. You would go through the day with this unconfortable sensation that you are constantly being watched but whats even worse is that your thaughts are also being monetered. imagen your children in this situation. This would then lead on to teaching them that they shoulden't produce thaughts or emotions on there own even if they were negative thaughts.

Second, I disagree because there is no academic assistance that this technolagy would assists students there for it is not nessasary. This tech dosen't provides instructions or academic reasoning it just reads emotions.

Third, I don't agree with D'Alto's claim because I don't respect the idea of robbing next generations the right to interact with an actual human teachers. If we allowed this tech we would deprive human contact from kids at such a young age. Because kids brains are like sponges at such a young age we shove so much information at such a young age that if we take human conntact away they would become socialy deprived of that connection to humans so thats why I believe we should not implament this tech into education.
