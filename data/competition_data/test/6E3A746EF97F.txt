Hey you there, would you like to be a Seagoing Cowboy? Well let me tell you a little something , becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is exciting and really helpful to those peaple in need. Can you help frowns upside down?

Some things that you might do if you join , like Luke Bomberger is,"To take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas." Not much but wait till it turns into an adventure.

Something eles that you might do is , while your on board , you can see a lot of intersting thing that you never knew about. Like different countries,small towns,or little islands. Like when Luke was on his way to China,he excavated castle in Creete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China . If you deside becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, you might do all these exciting things too.

At the begging of the story,it stated,"To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more , 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA."

Which that all started the Seagoing Cowboys.

As you can see this "UNRRA" helped people with so many things and part of that group was the Seagoing Cowboys.

So once again, would you like to become a Seagoing Cowboy? Please make up your mind and if you do, I'm telling you, you are going to have a life time opportunity.

So if your not joining , your going to miss out on an adventure. Sorry. Thank you and have wonderful day.
