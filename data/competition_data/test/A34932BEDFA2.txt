When people thing of the future they think of the movie "Back To The Future" hoping that one day the society we live willone day become like that. Technology has advanced and scientists have found ways to make the movie fantasy of the 80's come to life. But, are driverless cars really a great thing for this society?

I believe that a driverless car is a frightening thing to see, even thought there are great pros that come with the idea, cons win in my belief. For example, car accidents happen almost all the time and they can be deadly. With a driverless car would be even worst. Who is it that we are to blame? The driver of the manufacturer? This also, questions new traffic laws if they were to be put in plan. It is already worst enough in my belief that we as amaericans have to go to a court a argue our arguement, to then have to sit infront of a judge that decides wether it is my fault of the fault of the manufacturer. It believe that it would not be a fair fight.

Car accidents, and court dates can be deadly both physically and mentally. But you know what is more deadly? Obesity. Did you know that the United States of America has the most Obesity rate in the whole world? Now, do we really want driverless cars that just take us anywhere we want, to the point that the only walking I would do is from the parking lot the the inside of the store? Children are the new face of America the futurte is held in our hands.

It would be insane to see a young adult dead at the age of just twenty-one. We are already fighting obesity and trying to lower the rate, but if we add more to the problem instead of helping it, America's death rate will be massive. More that it already is.

Obesity is one thing but going bankrupt is another. In our modern society today. Our world is surrounded by technology, we thrive off if it, we live, it. We breath it. It is like an addicting drug that not even a reheb center can fix, but it just takes self control, that people today don't seem to have. Techonology is so expensive that people are willing to give to great lengths to spoil their children with. There are more important things that driverless car, that could cost up to more than your house. For example, utility bills, they have to be paid without them you don't have much to live for then, they driverless car is not going to feed you. What is even worst in my belief is if you go bankrupt and loose everything you've worked up for just to then waste is all on a car that could later kill you or make you fatter. Either way you die, right?

In conclusion, driverless cars will be a bad impact on our society, and I believe that if we agree to an aburd thing such as a driverless car that our ecomomic system will have such a downfall. with obese children and poor people walking around that we will enter such a horrible downfall in health, money and large amounts of death rates.
