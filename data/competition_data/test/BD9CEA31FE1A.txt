Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I Think that the students at SCHOOL_NAME should perform community service. I think this because not only will it help our community but it will also help our student body become better people. For example it will tech our students responsibility. In addition it will also teach our students how to care for others and not just for themselves. Finally it will also teach them how to have patients with others. All of this is better for the students. Community service can also be fun.

Community service can teach our students how to be responsible. For example if the student is scheduled to go somewhere to help out with something it will show them that being on time is a crucial part of their job. Also if a student is doing community service by babysitting a child it will show them how to take care of someone and being able to help. Another example of how community service can make a student responsible is when the student is asked to do something they need to do it. This will come in handy at school with turning in assignments on time and putting in hard work.

Community service will teach the students to care for others and not just for themselves. For example if a student is babysitting it will show them how to care for an infant or even a toddler. Also it will help teach students care by showing that if someone needs help doing something that he or she will help and not just stand there and watch. Doing community service can also show care for others by picking up trash in unwanted areas. These are all examples of how doing community service can help students care for others.

Doing community service can also teach them how to have patients with others. For example if a student is asked to do a lot of things it will help them realize that helping others is no such a bad thing and that its good to help others. Another example of how it teaches patients is when a student is babysitting a child and the child will not go to sleep the student can read a book with the child and eventually the child will get tired and fall asleep. These are all examples of how doing simple community service can help a student become a better person.

In this letter I showed you examples of how doing community service teaches responsibility, teaches students how to care for others, and how it helps students have more patients. I hope that you choose to require the student body to do community service because i feel that if you do make them work it will really show them how much they can help change themselves to become better.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
