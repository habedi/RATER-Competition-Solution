Dear Principle,

I think you should go with policy 1. I think if you allowed students to have there cell phones during lunch and other free times would allow them to make important phone calls to parents or send texts to parents about certain things. Some days they may need something they don't have and there to far from the office so they would pull out there cell phones to call and ask or get there parents to bring them something, and they shouldn't be able to get there phones token up in the process of doing that.

All students in the school would agree that if there class was on the opposite of the school they wouldn't want to walk all the way to the office just to tell their parents that something wrong happened. Now on the other hand they could use them to make phone calls to friends. they could tell their friends to save seats at lunch and they could tell their friends that they need them a. s. a. p for some strange emergency. Instead of having to go walk around the school in a rush trying to find that friend and trying not to be late they could text or call on the way to their next class.

Kids all ways make up little excuses during break to go call at the office complaining there "sick" and going to the nurse saying they don't "feel good." Well news flash the office would send them to the nurse and the nurse doesn't have time for little faker's. So in the hall if they fell "sick" they can call or text whoever they live with to come get them.

So now that you see my side and most of the other students story I hope you understand that i'm speaking for all kids in the school. We all want you to consider letting us have our phones during lunch and other breaks for those certain little concerns, important sayings, and little emergency's that the office don't like to call for. So please choose policy 1.
