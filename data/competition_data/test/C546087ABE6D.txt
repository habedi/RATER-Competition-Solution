I think we should be able to us our phones at any free time that we may have and that they should be off just in the class room. But if that becomes a problem then you can take away our phone privileges. We should be able to use our cell phones in case of an emergency or if we need anything from our homes. Some kids use their phones when the teacher isn't looking or when they go to the restroom or anything else when they leave the classroom or in the classroom. I only use my cell phone when its the end of the day and the bell has wrong for us to get out if school and go home or do anything that we have to do when we are out of school st that time. Some kids use it in the library when they are by their self's or in the hall on the way to class. But i think we should be able to use our phones at any free time and at our lunch period to text or call or friends or parents. I would love to use my phone at any free time because i have my friends texting me while we are in school and my parents text me at times to tell me that i am an car rider or to stay after school and to ride the bus so that's why i think we should be able to use our phones at any free time. Sometimes girls have their problems and they might need some personal things that them or their friends may not have and they might need their mother to bring them something or their guardian to do it for them. We have problems that we should be able to use our phones and get that type of help from our friends and other people that we may know that can help us with our problems that we are having because they might know the answer to our problems and other things like that. People just don't understand why we need to us our phones at times they are so strict about it they don't want our phones to fall out of our pocket if
