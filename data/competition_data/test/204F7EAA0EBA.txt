The reason i think everyone should parcitipate in extracurricular activitys is because, it would make kids more active. also children could socialize more often. And if kids socialize more less kids would be shy. Plus more kids will have something to do after school.

Also when you find the extracurricular you want to do then while your doing it you could make more/new friends. i mean look at all the clubs there endless, so no mater what you like theres a club or activity for you. And if you dont like any of the clubs you can always try something new. and somehow you always learn something when you try something new.

Last year i played football and i learned that its not just throwing and catching the ball. you have to memorize plays and routes, and sometimes thats alot of plays to remember. and theres not just sports say you like playing chess as an example theres a club for that to.

so in conclusion the reason i think everyone should do extracurriculars is because, it would be fun and you would learn. and it would help people that are shy make friends. so yes i think it would help kids become better people.
