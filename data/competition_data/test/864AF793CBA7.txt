Dear Principal,

As one of those schools students in the school I recommend that this school should have a tutoring session for smaller kids in the area and in the school its self. Its a good idea and it helps student learn how to become an educator later in their life time.

Now think about this, what if some of the students in the upper grade are bored and have nothing to do. If the school has a tutoring program to help younger students who are struggling and kids from the area, we could have a better time having an education experience and it would be free so its easy for parents. This gives the school a chance to prove themselves to the community and also help the young ones get a good grade.

Next parents who don't really know how to do the work or they are very busy could just let them stay after school for an hour and have their child get tutored. I have a private tutor of my own and my grades are improving better because of my tutor OTHER_NAME. Every Tuesday after school I take public transportation downtown. Since I get out of school at 1:45pm, I am an hour and 30 min early because the program starts at 5. when 5 comes around kids from any school from grammar to high school come to eat dinner, then we have any activity's, last we go to our own tutors we have for the year and they help us with school work or anything we really need.

RELATIVE_NAME really helps me with my science and writing. but at this school we can take any student who dose there best in a class then find a child who needs that help the most. Also teachers could pitch in and help out if the tutor doesn't really know something. That way kids can get all the help they need and pass and parents would be proud of their children and the tutors. Our school would be a top rated in the area and grades will be going up and our school average will be increasing in the good of the students.

The final reason is that now a days kids are bored and need something to do that they want to help with. It may sound like hard work but it is easy if you choose what grade level they would like to work with. Then the students, tutors, and parents will be happy. Even yourself on all the service your loving students would do for the school they go to.

So yes tutoring at school would be a good idea and it gets the homework done with help and test will be passed. Grades will improve, kids will be busy, parents will be happy, so many reasons why this is a good idea makes it hard to resist for even myself to join in something like this.

From your student,
