Not all students have the summer to relax and have fun. Some schools have their students complete a project over the summer to make sure they continue learning over the break. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would give the students a rubric, and the students don't have to worry about coming up with a project.

The summer projects should be teacher-designed because they give you a rubric. Not all projects or assignments have a rubric to go off of. Whenever I have a project or assignment from a teacher, I would prefer a rubric so I know what I have to include in the project. A rubric is nice to have because you won't include things that are unnecessary to the project. If you choose the teacher-designed project, you have a rubric to go off of.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the students don't have to worry about coming up with a project. As a student, I prefer not coming up with the summer assignments because I over thinkÂ about coming up with ideas for projects.

Having the teacher give me the assignment and what to put in the project is better for me. The teacher-designed projects would show what we have to put in the project.

Although, having the projects teacher-designed gives the students a rubric and what they have to do, the summer assignments should also be student-designed. It should be student-designed because the student can do a project on something that interests them, and they will become more responsible for their project and they're findings. However, teacher-designed projects have everything planned out for the student, so the students don't need to worry.

These summer projects should be teacher-designed because they have a rubric to go off of and the teachers give you what it is expected on the project. Next time there is a summer project and you have to option of doing it your way or the teachers way, or teacher-designed, do teacher-designed. It will be easier for you, and it won't be difficult to come up with ideas or make a checklist, or rubric, for yourself.
