Should drivers be able to use their phone while operating a vehicle?

The age of technology is upon humanity and is affecting the species far more than anyone has expected. With more modernized devices being released at such a fast pace, it is not likely that one human of five will not have one. Technology, especially the usage of smart phones, has become ultimately distracting to humans. Operating a vehicle, however, is not the time to be distracted. Any driver, no matter the experience or skill, should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle because it is hazardous to themselves and others, and it is a leading cause of death.

To begin with, the distraction of a cellular device is most dangerous to the driver. Not only are they putting their life on the line to send a text or view a snapchat, they are also putting their license up for suspension and possible jail time because it is an illegal activity. Any impairment of a driver is an illegal act and can be tried in the court of law.

These drivers willingly know the consequences when they pull out their phone. It is important that the driver adhere to the responsibility bestowed upon them for the safety of themselves and others. Any mistakes made while moving are solely the driver's fault. A text or a call cannot amount to the value of a life, and the act of texting while driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In other words, it would be thought that driving while using a phone would be less of an issue. However, it is one of the number one causes of death.

Moreover, the management of a cellphone while driving is one of the main causes of death today. These on-going issues have led to "1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving." (The National Safety Council Texting and Driving Statistics - Distracted Driving).

Not only are these wrecks traumatic to everyone involved, they effect the loved ones of those who got injured or died.

With such high stats, humans have began working to fix this matter in question. Many modern cars have come out with Bluetooth in the radio system which assists the driver with using his or her phone without actually using their phone. Bluetooth allows drivers to play music, text, and call all with minimal work applied. This update in technology can be seen as a breakthrough in modern advancements; but, it also has its faults that come along with it.

While managing to make the Bluetooth setting work, drivers can also find themselves just as distracted. Losing focus for five seconds or more on the road increases the risk of accidents and injuries. Looking somewhere else other than the road is just another second that the driver is not looking at oncoming traffic or pedestrians.

To conclude, a driver should not be allowed to use a cellular device while managing or operating a moving vehicle due to the risk of harming themselves as well as others, and the fact that it is illegal today and everyday following. Being a hazard on the road makes a hazard for everywhere around it. In this period of time, humans are developing technology to prevent this topic from happening in the future; however, until fully preventable, it should not be permitted.
