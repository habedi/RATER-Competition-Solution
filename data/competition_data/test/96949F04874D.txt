Using the phone while driving is one of the leading cause of death in America. Phones are supposed to help make communication easier, but instead using it causes a distraction. When the phone vibrates, the driver normally looks down at the phone to see what notification they just received. By checking the phone, everything can go wrong in the seconds it takes the driver to check.

It can cause an accident and it takes up to much time and money to fix the car. Not all accidents end lightly like some accidents can kill people.

The passengers also need to feel safe and conferrable in the car. If the driver is using their phone while driving with the passenger(s) and the driver gets into a wreck, not only does the driver get hurt but also dose the passenger(s). Sometimes the wrecks can get horrible and neither of them make it out alive. Other times the driver makes it and the passenger(s) do not. It is also possible that the passenger(s) could get nervous, reacted in a bad way, and make the situation a lot worse. Sometimes people do not realize how things can go from good, too bad, too worse in a couple of seconds.

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use the phone while in the car. They put the hands free law. Now drivers can no longer have phones "touching any part of their body". If the driver is stopped by a cop, and they are on their phone. They face a $50 fine and goes up every time the cop stopes them. Georgia is the 16th state to pass such a hands-free law.

People need to understand that phones are dangerous. They are a distraction and they are a safety issue. If people do not know how to control themselves and not use it then the law was rightfully placed. People kill others and die every day because of them not paying attention to the rode. Driving is like a war because its life or death.
