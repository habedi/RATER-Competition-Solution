The landform that looks like a face on Mars is a natural landform. We have taken close up pictures of it and it is proven that it is a mesa. There are mesas on Earth and other planets like Mars,too. Landforms can look like they have eyes, nose, and mouth. But they are wrong. The eyes, nose, and mouth are probably crevices on top of the mesa

There are pictures that are snapped ten thousand times sharper than the original Viking photos. We could see if there were alien markings on the mesa because we could use a digial image three times bigger than the pixel size. Mesas are common around the Amerian West inthe desert, just like on Mars. A lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same size as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a butte or mesa according to our cameras. The only way we can prove them wrong is that we go on the suface of Mars and look at the face or make better cameas,
