Dear TEACHER_NAME, no I do not think all students should be required to do community service because as teenagers, we should be able to choose for ourselves what we want to do with our free time.

some students may want to perform community service because that's what they like to do to help out the community, but other students feel that it is not needed and instead choose to go to the mall or to the movies.

One example of community service we have at our school is student council. participants in student council perform community service by recycling, raking leaves for people in our naborhood, or shoveling driveways and sidewalks for the elderly. But they don't always go around doing those favors; Some days they go on fun field trips to the movies or to amusement parks, and go ice skating because life isn't always about picking up trash or raking leaves. These tasks might be helpful to some but as young adults we also need freedom and fun in our daily schedules. I think that if you are going to require students to do community service, it should only be once or twice a week, and the days that groups of students go, should fit in their schedule because there might be something they have to do that is more important than community service. Also the students should be rewarded for their hard work, and participation.

I disagree with the requirement of community service because, if we like doing community service we will do it on our own time. Some parents might also disagree because they don't want their child missing school and missing out on a good education because they are out raking leaves and picking up litter. Yes, it does help the community and the residence in the community, and yes, it is helpful to people and is a good deed to do, but it is unfair to make someone do something that they don't want to do. that is
