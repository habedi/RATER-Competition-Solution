Dear Principal,

I think that you should choose policy one. There is no harm in letting students use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times.

It's a good way to show your students that you are willing to compromise with them. Maybe they might start behaving better if out let them use their phones during lunch or free times.

I believe it is a way better policy than the second. the second is completely disregarding anything that any students may have to say on the subject. The second policy is not compromising with anyone, and it's almost like the students are being punished. I don't think it's fair to say that they can't bring their phones to school at all. What if they need to get in touch with their parents. What are they supposed to do then. That would make things at school very complicated, you'd have students who live far away and need a ride home, or students in sports might have a game. I'm a wrestler and I'm constantly calling my father to tell him if practice is over, because practice times are unpredictable. If I wasn't allowed to bring my phone I would have no way to call my father and that would cause a lot of confusion.

Another good thing about the first policy is that students will be able to socialize and communicate. Which is an important part of society. Just to be clear even though I think policy one is good and that students should be allowed to use cell at certain times of the day, I also believe that you should be very strict on enforcing the rule of not using the phones in class. That way students will still be able to learn and still get work done instead of just socializing.

Overall I believe that policy one is the one you should choose, and I hope what I told you in this letter was helpful in making your decision.

Sincerely,
