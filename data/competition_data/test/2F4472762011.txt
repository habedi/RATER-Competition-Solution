When one thinks of transportation, the first idea that springs into a persons mind would be a car. A car is used almost daily for many people. It helps us get to point A to point B rain or shine. However, complications arise from the use (or overuse) of cars. The advantages of limiting car usage includes reduction in pollution, promote public transport, and cut off traffic.

Pollution has become a growing problem as the world continues to industrialize. The greenhouse gases emitted by machines, such as cars, have been proven detrimental to the enviornment. In car-dense citites, smog, a mixture of smoke and fog, has become a nuisance as it covers cities. In extreme cases,it makes the air citizens breathe toxic! According to Source 1, " Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.". To establish limits to car usage would then, therefore, reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and clear up conditions not only for the world, but make the over-all city more enjoyable to live in. In order to reduce pollution and clear the air, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the international city. Source 2 states that " The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban..." proving that limiting car usage benefitted the city and the enviornment as well.

Reduction of car usage would lead to the promotion of public transportation. Public transport was free of charge during the ban in Paris which stated was a success in reducing pollution. Limiting car usage would then correlate in the promotion of public transport which, according to Source 4, "...public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions [of greenhouse gases] and improve safety"Â  This not only benefits one's safety and environment but allows time-efficient traveling as buses and other public transport run along a contiuous schedule. Public transport also produces carpooling, which allows the reduction of cars on the road. This also eliminates a distributor in the production of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere which benefits the world.

Limiting car usage will take one annoying factor from our daily lives-- traffic. As a suburban citizen living in Florida, traffic has become a daily nuisance of mine, one that not only is frusterating but stressful. It wastes time that I need to invest in being somewhere of importance. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up their cars in their experimental new district near the French and Swiss borders. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says " When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." In Paris, "congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..." during their ban in response to reduce pollution. This would make the lives of many citizens much more happier and time efficient as there are no worries about arrving late to an area of importance!

Limiting car usage in many large cities accross the globe is not impossible, it has been done successfully in globally impactful cities such as Paris. This reduction of cars will not only benefit a community or a city, but the whole world! It will reduce pollution, promote the usage of public transport and carpooling and cut down on the rush-hour traffic leaving condtions in cities much more enjoyable to live in.
