In a 2019 survey about homework during the summer, it was found that the majority of students said that they were extremely stressed about summer assignments that teacher's had required them to do. Many of the students expressed that they had busy schedules and could not find the time to complete the assignments. Other's said that the projects were too difficult and confusing because they were designed poorly. While some will say that these summer assignments should continue to be designed by teachers because they are more educational, to be beneficial, the assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption.

Firstly, summer assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom. For instance, the majority of the assignments are question or essay based. This means that instead of enjoying a learning activity that applies to them, students will have to answer dull repetitive questions and write uninteresting essays about topics that they have no passion for. In result, students will put minimum effort into the assignments and finish them without learning anything. Also, if the summer assignments were designed by the students, they would pick a topic that they have interest in or believe would be enjoyable to complete. For example, if a project was assigned that allowed students to present an issue that they found interesting, the student would more than likely be excited and motivated to write about their topic. Overall, projects assigned during the summer should be designed by the students in order to prevent boredom.

Secondly, students should design their summer assignments to prevent frustration. This is because during the summer, teachers will assign packets or papers that are confusing and difficult to complete, thinking that it will be beneficial or educational. However, this is not the case. Many students will find themselves stuck or frustrated trying to complete something that they have no idea how to do. This results in uncompleted or incorrect work that then starts the student's school year off poorly. Furthermore, if the assignments were designed by the students, they would have the ability to preview and understand what the project is asking. In other words, they would have the correct knowledge going into the assignment and will ultimately learn more about the material for the following school year. In the end, a project designed by a student will prevent frustration.

Lastly, summer projects designed by the students will take up less time. This is because many students are extremely busy during the summer. Between sports, vacations, and possible online classes, students find it difficult to manage summer homework. Teachers are not aware of every student's schedule and can assign projects that are almost impossible to complete. However, if the projects were designed by the students, this would not occur. Instead, students would design a project that they could easily time manage and complete in their own time. Also, because teacher-designed projects are long and complicated, this can cause a student to miss out on fun activities. This is because of the created stress and limited time that the students often experience from the projects assigned. For example, during the summer, many students are traveling and are rarely in town at the same time. However, when they are, a student with an unfinished project, could miss out on an opportunity to see their friend because they are too busy with homework. All in all, summer projects should be student-designed because this would prevent time consumption.

Overall, students should design the summer projects. This is because it will prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption. If students experience these effects, the projects assigned will not only ultimately be ineffective but it will cause unnecessary stress. The purpose of summer is to enjoy a break from school anxiety. If projects do not reflect this, then a student's summer could possibly be ruined. In the end, in order prevent this, talk to your teacher and see if your summer could be saved with an enjoyable, simple, and quick project instead.
