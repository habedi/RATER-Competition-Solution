Over the years teachers have been assigning summer projects. Imagine if students were able to design their own projects for summer break. Some people say students designing their own work will teach them time management. Others say teachers designing summer work will give students a challenge. Summer projects should be teacher designed because students will be more challenged, teachers are more experienced, and students will not be focused. Teachers designing work will benefit students more than students designing work would.

Initially, teachers should design summer projects because students will be challenge. Students will want to take the least amount of time doing school work in the summer, so they will design a project that can get done fast with no effort. When teachers design summer projects they give enough work that will keep students learning throughout the whole break. For instance, teachers design summer projects with day by day sections, so students can not rush through it all in one day. To keep students working through the whole summer teachers are the best at designing summer projects.

Some people may argue that summer projects should be student designed because it teaches students time management. Students need to be able to manage their time accordingly and experience critical thinking skills for future references. Despite these reasons, summer projects should be teacher designed because students tend to lose focus during big projects. Students being on summer break will result in them focusing on what is more fun rather than their school work. Teacher designed projects will assure that students are focused on getting the task done.

Second, summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers have more experience. Teachers know students will wait until the last minute to try to come up with a quick project. Teachers will already have a summer project ready before summer break, so students will not have an excuse to why they could notÂ finish the project. Additionally, teachers already know what skills everyone struggles with. When returning back to school teachers will not have to struggle to reteach a skill. The topic that is chosen for students to complete over the summer will benefit students for the upcoming school year. Teachers designing summer projects will benefit the students more than students designing summer projects.

In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher designed because students will be more challenged, teachers are more experienced, and students will not be focused. Students will try to get the easy way out if they are able to pick their own work. Teachers know what is best for students during their summer break. They can provide tips to help students along the way and assure students stay focused on their assignment. Teachers designing summer work will give students more time to enjoy summer rather than stressing over what to do as an summer assignment.
