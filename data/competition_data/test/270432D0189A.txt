Phones and driving

In my opinion I believe that people should not be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Reason why is because teenagers or even adults have died from using their cell phone while driving. In fact, if people drive while using their device there is a 99% that they will get distracted causing them to not focus on the road,which means also causing an accident. For instance, about one year ago I experienced texting and driving and it wasn't a good experience. I was accelerating at that moment and for some reason I thought I was capable of multitasking by using my phone and driving because my parents had kept on calling. I was trying to decline the phone call and after I did I had decided to go on social media, which was a very bad idea. I then ended up hitting a car that was in front of me because I did not notice that it was braking. so, once again i do believe that people should not be able to use their cell phones while driving.

In More phones More wrecks? Distracted driving on the rise this article is about how phones have been causing accidents throughout the years, but also how there is a solution from causing accidents (Sidibe 2015). For example, The Collision-Avoidance Technology in cars are now available in cars for drivers. Hersman thinks that with this being in the vehicle drivers would be less distracted and can also help them on being focused towards the road. He also had mentioned that cars are also being developed by companies such as Google and are will also help drunk drivers and also teen drivers as well. Advanced cars like these can also reduce the amounts of billions of dollars of people who wreck and also which would highly benefit taxpayers from and of these wrecks. A con thing about the car and technology is that for some people it's bad and also cannot focus that way either.

https://www. cnn. com/2015/02/17/living/feat-brutally-honest-teens-texting-driving/index. html Fifty-five percent of young adult drivers say that it's easy for them to text and drive and another thirty-four percent of of them have stated that they have driven on the road while on the phone (Wallace 2016).The risks and percentages of accidents caused by texting and driving have raised up tremendously in the U.S. more than Eight people die caused by driving and at the same time while on their phone. On the other hand 44 states have made it illegal to drive and text states such as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands etc. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also allegedly reported that more than a thousand people are injured in crashes that have been reported to inlove a distracted young driver whose been most of the times accused of accidents. Janis Brett Elspas, a mother of four children also said that while texting and driving shares and says that she might be one of the few drivers who has never checked her phone or grab it at all while operating a vehicle.

Many people might say and agree to themselves that it's easy to operate a vehicle while driving because they think they are capable of doing it. Most of the result at many times end up in a accident and end up regretting what they've done and kept in mind that they were capable of when they really weren't. Many of adults tell and ask them for the favor to not drive a car and use their phone but i think that most of these kids in the generation don't understand because they've never been in an accident or experienced texting and driving and end up in a car crash. They might have the excuse to say "oh I'm in a rush and I'm in a emergency" etc. but they don't realize it's not worth it because they don't think about the consequences after wards. Some of adults might also eat while driving and still get distracted while driving. They'll reach for some fries and just by taking of a second off the road could end uo the biggest time of their lives.

Once again In my opinion I think that drivers in general should not be at any time or for whatever reason on their phones. However even if I say that they shouldn't it wont do nothing about it because everybody has their own opinion like I have mine. States,agencies,companies etc. have been against all of driving and texting because by experience and they know how young teenage kids are. People who have experienced this have never done it again i know because ever since i did and went through whatever I did i've never grabbed a phone while driving. I don't think that technology will benefit in any type of way except the gps while operating a vehicle in any effective way.
