I don't think you should change the school policy. This is what I think because if you change the school policy the school team might not be as good, you don't want that do you? also if students don't have something to do after school they might start doing inappropriate stuff.

I don't think you should change the school policy because some really good athletes have mostly C' s. Therefore if they get taken off the team because of low grades the teams defence or the offence might not be as good as before. Say this were the case, the team is built up good and strong wit good athletes and an even better one leading the team. But all of the sudden his grades drop down to C average and he gets taken off the team because of his grades. If that happened some of the player might get disappointed. If they are disappointed it might affect the way they play and if this happens the defensive or the offensive plays might not be as good with them not trying as hard as they can. That would be bad for the school reputation, and I know you wont like that.

In addition if you change the policy of the school some students might not have something to do after school. Therefore they will get bored and if they get bored they will get curious and start doing inappropriate stuff. Say for example a student gets kicked out of the Jr. historian club, and he has nothing to do at home. Then he will start doing other stuff. Maybe make new friends, and those friends aren't exactly the best students ever. so he hangs out with them more and more and someday they ask him if he wants some drugs and he says yes because he has nothing better to do. Then he gets addicted and cant stop and then gets expelled for doing it or arrested.

in conclusion you should not change the school policy becouse some students have bad grades but are good athletes and some wouldn
