Dear Senator,

I am writing to Complain about the electoral college. It is not a good and reliable way to elect a president. The desicion needs to be up to us, not the electors. It needs a change, badly.

For starters, the electoral college is small. It says in the passage, "What is the electoral college?", that "The electoral college consists of 538 electors". Now, its no rocket science to me, but that is nothing compared to the Billion people that live in this country. Now, i know that some might say that even though we have the right to vote at the age of 18, not every one votes. And, as that is true, i can tell you for a fact that more than 538  citezens of America vote every year. That is the problem for the electoral college.

Now, if that isn't convincing enough, just know that in the passage, "The Indefensable electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong", it says that over 60 porcent of voters would rather have a direct election instead of the kind we have now.  And, it says that the voters are not even voting for a president, but instead, voting for a slate of electors to vote for a president.

Another reason that the elecotral college should be disposed of is that it can turn off voters whose state is already set on Democrat or Republican, and  have no desire to vote due to the fact that thier vote may not matter, as it says in the last paragraph of "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our Despised method of choosing a president". That is wrong because every one's vote needs to count, wether it makes a difference in the end or not.

So, Senator, I hope you understand where i am coming from on this,  and that something can be done. Thank you for your time. Good-Bye.
