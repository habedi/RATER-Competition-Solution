I don't think that it is a good thing to force students to participate in a extracurricular activity. Some students might not have transportation to pick them up from the activity after school. Some students just want to go home and relax after school. The school should just let the students choose what they want to do instead of forcing them to do it. I disagree with this decision because not all students have transportation from the activities, not all students have the energy to do something after school, and there is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities.

Not all students have transportation from the extracurricular activity. Some students' parents work all day and don't have the time to pick their child up from those activities. Most kids just ride the bus home because their parents are still working when school ends. For example, lets say that there is a students that normally rides the bus home. If that student's parents work until seven o'clock at night, than the bus is that student's only transportation home.

Not all students have the energy after school to do any other activities. Some students might not get enough sleep at night and are tired throughout the school day. Maybe some students have a young sibling that they have to help take care of. That could cause them to have less energy than normal. Some students skip breakfast, which causes them to have less energy during the day too.

There is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities. For example we have enough for all the sports teams to have a full team. Not only do we have enough, but those students want to do those activities and haven't been forced to do it. There will always be some group of students that want to do a extracurricular activity. There is no need to force students to participate in a extracurricular activity.

Forcing students to participate in a extracurricular activity is unnecessary. Some students don't have transportation from the activity. Some students don't have the energy after school. Also, there is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities. I disagree with this decision because not all students have transportation from the activities, not all students have the energy to do something after school, and there is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities.
