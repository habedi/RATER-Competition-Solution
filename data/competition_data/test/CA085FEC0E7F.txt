In my point of view i think that's not fair to other students because some students cant learn like other students. like some students are some what slow in the head so the don't understand like we can. So how can you judge the student that want to play sports and got C averages and now can not play?

When students have a C average in school it not really bad. Because

C is a passing grade. Some students they work there best to get good grades and still get a C average on there report card.

I can see if you wont let students play sports if they don't have good grades like F" s and D" s on there report cards and don't show effort to there work. but students that do show effort on their work they should able to play sports.

And students that don't act right at school those are the ones shouldn't be able to play sports. So why punches student that got ok grades and do good in school, and got good behavior so those are the ones that should be able to play sports.
