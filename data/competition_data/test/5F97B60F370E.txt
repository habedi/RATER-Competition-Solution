Which would they rather do? A project that is chosen by them and their peers or the teacher? Students are constantly given assignments of which they have chosen and yet, some still never take the addictive to do the work to help them succeed. If they were to have student-designed some would not even attempt to do the project. Students should have a teacher-designed project because it would encourage them, there would be guidelines and less stress on choosing a topic.

Firstly, some people do not that have the motivation to do a projects and they need something to help keep them on track and push them to do it. Some students have a problem with procrastination when it comes to big assessments such as projects, an essay, or even a simple PowerPoint. For example, they have a 600 word essay due in 2 weeks and its worth 30% of their grade. They will wait 2 days before it is due to finally take time and do it. If a teacher were to have something they have to work toward that they would really want to would drive them to do their best.

Secondly, when there are guidelines to a project it gives that sense of urgency. A project or any assignment should be done without some source of instruction or direction on what to do. For example, if they were given an assignment and just told to do it would come out extremely unorganized. Teachers being in charge of a summer project is much better than students handling it because they have deadlines for each part of the project

However some students want to do a project on something they chose and feel as though they need help with. For example, there is a student who has aced every single lesson that the teacher has taught but, the last lesson that they learned they really had a hard time on understanding it and its time for the projects the be assigned. They were assigned something that they knew with their eyes closed. Although, that may be true having a teacher-designed project is a lot easier because all they would have to is do the work instead of stressing about what they can do their project on.

In conclusion, when an assigned is monitored by a teacher it is more likely to go smoother than leaving the responsible to get their work done up to them to decide. It is preferred and it would be better for everyone if the teachers gave the topic to prevent anybody have the same one,anybody not knowing what to do, and it help motivate them.
