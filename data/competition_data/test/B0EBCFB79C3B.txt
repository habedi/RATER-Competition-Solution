Imagine waking up every morning and not know where the next meal will come from, imagine not feeling safe in a place that is supposed to be home. This is a reality for many children, which causes many students to find school as a refuge and take more comfort in being at school then at home. Some people believe they will be able to accomplish more in their own house; however, that is not the case for everyone, some children aren't safe in their own home and some don't even have the resources to be successful at home.

Their are children who dont know where their next meal will come from or where they are going to stay at night: there are many children who dont have the resources to be successful in school so how could they do it at home. Most adults in America live paycheck to paycheck, but what happens when they dont make enough? Then parents will have to make a difficult decision on what to use their money for, should they pay for food this week or should they use it to keep the roof over their heads? Some schools offer free lunches and breakfasts to the students who have financially needs, but what happens to those promises of meals for students when they will be expected to do their schooling at home? As a child in the environment of constant uncertainty it is impossible for them to do their absolute best in school, so how could they even attempt to do that it home. Before the schools explore the idea of doing all of school at home, they first need to explore ways to get all students the resources they need to be successful.

Now what about the students who don't feel safe in their own home, whether it is to violent or just not a place for a child. Their are many reasons why a student might not feel safe in their home, so why should they feel as if they are expected to stay at home. These students see school as a refuge from what goes on at home, and as an opportunity to feel normal, so how would they feel if most of their classmates decided they would only do online school? They would feel the same way they feel at home, as if they don't fit in or they aren't wanted.

The fact of the matter is, many people do feel better when they are in their house, and will succeed better there, but that is not the case for everyone. Schools are able to offer a lot to the students to help them, like giving them a laptop or giving students anything else they need to be successful at their house, but what about the kids who dont feel safe? Having a bunch of things won't make the child feel comfort, there are still a bunch of outside forces that the schools cant take in count of. There are children who get abused mentally and physically everyday by family members, and they try to look for any chance to get away from their so called home. Therefore, yes many will do and feel a lot better about doing school work at home, but some children try everything they can to not be at home, so why should schools take away a refuge for students.

In conclusion, not every student will feel safe or have the resources to work form home, so why should they get subjected to feel like outsiders. As a result, before school decide that it is better to do everything from home they need to figure out how to benefit every single students and how to fix to their needs. Since every single human deserves and has a right to an education that is equal and fair.
