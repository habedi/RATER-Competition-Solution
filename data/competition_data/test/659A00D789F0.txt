Dear Principal i thing every student should do some community serves. Because instead of wasting their time staying home and playing video games, watching T.V they could be helping other people that need their help. They could at least help clean up the park by picking up trash and recycle plastic water bottles. They play in the park to so they should help clean it in keep it nice. Or they could help at a shelter helping people that need food or cloths. Since they live in this community i think they should help it in take part in it. They could also help a small kid by tutoring them in help them understand something they don't get at school. they shouldn't be foolish and help around because helping around in our community is very important. Even if they only do it for a few hours at least they did something that made the community better. Just by giving a little pit of there time to do something help full. By doing it makes you feel good about our selves knowing that you did something good. it also teach us a lessen not to be foolish and help out ones a wile.
