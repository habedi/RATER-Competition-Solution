We (NASA) have recently discovered the "face" on Mars which has been a big thing since we gave the information out to the world.

A lot of people think it's an actual face created by aliens because the time before we discovered it it was foggy up on Mars so they think aliens must have did it then.

Do you think it's a real face created by aliens or just something natural that happened? Since you said yes your wrong and now I'm going to give factoral information to support my answer.

First we did think that it could have been a real face too but that didn't last very long because every happening has to have an explanation.

We figured it was just another Martian mesa but it did turn out to have unusual shadows making it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

But that's all it was just unusual shadows that appeared on the "face".

We then later revealed the image for everyone to see and it sure did give a lot of attraction to Mars.

The "face" appeared in movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a haunted grocery store check out line for 25 years!

Then everyone thought that that was actual evidence of life on Mars!

NASA kind of did wish that there was ancient civilization on Mars.

It was our priority to take bunch of pictures of this controversy to come up with an explanation for all this for everyone to understand what it really is.

So in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, the (MOC) team shot a picture ten times that was even more clearer than the originals.

Everyone was exited, waiting for the picture to come out on the internet to figure out what it really was.

The picture then finally came out and it turned out to be a natural landform!

Not very exiting, huh?

But still a lot people didn't believe us because in the winter of 1998 it was very cloudy up there and some beleive the aliens were hidden by the fog.

So in April 2001, we went to get a second look and this time we used the best camera we could find that picked out every detail.

Do you think they found alien evidence?

Nope we didn't, it turned out to be a butte or a mesa.

So now you know the real answer.

Even though it does look like a face and is very unusual we found the facts.

But could maybe someday we find weird alien evidence up in space on a planet?

We'll see!
