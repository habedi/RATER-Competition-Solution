The unmasking the face on Mars is not a real face. As much as we wish here at Nasa that it was and there was an ancient civilzation on Mars so our budget would be higher but it is not. It is a natural landform, kinda like the Middle Butte In the Snake River Plain of Idaho. We have check mulitple times since there was a little haze in the first photo but we do not fly over it often. It took 18 long years to get to the bottom of this and it is simply just a natual landform. We are certain.

When we finally released the image we titled it "huge rock formation." It cause huge attention to Mars which we were indeed greatful for but in the picture it was formed by shawdows giving illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth. "Face on Mars became a pop icon, was in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and was the talk of grocery store check outlines for the next 25 years. You might think since we found that landform on mars it means there is life on Mars but that is information we do tnot want to reveal at the time. There is just no way that that was created by aliens but here at Nasa we wish it was. As you can now see it is not.

I understand there is a lot of theorist that ssy it was created by aliens but the truth does not lie and that we did not take the pictures at the right time because it was cloudy but once again we went and took more than one picture to make sure we were postive. We thought at the begginning what you did but there was factors that show it is not. We felt it was important because of the tax payers and to get the bottom of it and after 18 long years of questions we finally know it is just a ladnform
