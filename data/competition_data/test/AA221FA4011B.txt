First, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Venus can have a lot of dangers, since it's closer to the sun and the sun is really hot all 365 days a year. Venus is never going to be like Earth, it has all four types of weather all year around and Venus has only dangerous weathers all year around.

Secondly, a piece of evidence that supports my claim is in paragraph 3 it says, " A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. " That piece of evidence shows that Venus has a lot of chemicals in their air pollution and that's why barely any people go visit the planet. Next, another piece of evidence that supports my claim is in paragraph 3 it says, " On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. " That piece of evidence shows that Venus is a very hot planet since it close to the sun too, that means of one day you would go to Venus you would have to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated. Lastly, a piece of evidence that supports my claim in paragraph 3 it says, " Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments liking erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. " That piece of evidence shows that Venus can have any type of weather every sinlge day that is different acorrding to the temperature.

In conclusion, that's why I think the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The conditions in Venus are too extreme for humans to handle. People that would go to Venus probably would only last maybe a day. The next day they would want to go back to Earth and never come back to Venus again.
