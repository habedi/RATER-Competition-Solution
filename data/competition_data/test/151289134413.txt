In this passage, it is made very clear that exploring Venus is very unsafe for humans. While it is stated in paragraph 2, Venus can be thought of as a twin to Earth and it has many similarities, there are also many differances that make it very difficult for humans to set foot on Venus. In paragraph 3, it states "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." The atmosphere of our similar neighboring planet is just too toxic for a human to last long on the surface, let alone be able to call that planet their new home. Also in paragraph 3, it is stated that Venus's average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit which is impossible for earth living creatures to survive in. Also, the atmospheric pressure is so much greater than Earth's that the two conditions combined are too extreme for human life. Scientists may be able to find a way around all these issues, but it will take great amounts of time and effort.

Over time, all the issues involving the conditions of Venus may not matter. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has been looking into the issues for years. NASA is attempting to travel to Venus, but not land on the planet to evaluate it. If NASA could get rock samples and test the atmosphere around Venus, they could possibly find ways to edit it or edit human immunities to make it more likely to support human life on Venus. This would take a while to achieve and there is potential that nothing scientists find could improve the liklihood of life on Venus.

Recently, NASA has found kinds of electronics that can survive on Venus, but don't last long. In order to find out more about the probability of eventually having life on that planet, someone needs to develop a form of technology that will last long enough to evaluate the living conditions that future humans would have to undergo. Finding the materials needed to make electronics last on Venus is very difficult. The temperatures are so extreme that most materials would just melt. Eventually, it was discovered that mechanical computers, a very old form of technology, could last on Venus. If all electronics could be composed of the things the mechanical computers are composed of, it is probable that electronics could last for long periods of time on Venus and be able to collect the data needed to investigate the idea of human life on Venus.

Thanks to the data the electronics could gather, eventually things could be altered on Venus, on Earth, or both in order to allow life on the planet. These changes could take generations to be completely effective. The great difference in climate between the two planets, for example, could take many years to become less of an issue.

Although, there are many things keeping people from living on Venus, people must first make enough advances to visit Venus. If people are not able to set foot on the planet for long enough to collect samples to test back on Earth, there would be no way of supporting life long enough for people to live there. If people can get to the point of being able to stand on Venus without issue, then the advances will pretty well be enough to support life on our neighboring planet. The first step, however, is also the largest one. Advancing that much could take a large period of time, but it is definitely possible. Life on Venus could be a lot closer than some may think. In all reality, the differerances may not be that great, especially compared to the differences between Earth and other neighboring planets. There is evidence of water on Venus in years past, so if water can be put back on Venus or if waterbodies can be found on Venus once again, life could be supported in the years approching.

Although there are many dangers of life on Venus, it is nothing that Earth living creatures couldn't handle. Besides the temperature and atmosphere, life could easily be supported. These are big obstacles to pass, but there is no doubt that it could be overcome.
