In the article "The challenge of exploring venus" The author does a great job of supporting the idea. I think anyone who is adventuruse and likes to learn about space would agree with the author. Such as my self, I like learning about our facinating solar system as well. How ever there are some pros and cons of exploring venus. Theres alot of factoring that goes into something like exploring another planet. You need to plan for everything and make sure yor ready.

In the artile the author does a fantastic job of convincing the reader to believe that exploring venus is a good idea. He also states that "not a single spaceship has touched down on venus, This makes the reader want the integrity to do it even more. He also states the harsh conditions of venus and how no human could survive on venus. But yet comes up with a solution of how we can still go to venus wthout dieing. He purposes that you could use a "blimp like" plane to fly 30-40 miles above vensus and the tempuratres are bareable. However he doesnt propose whos funding it, how much it cost, or when this will take place. These things could lead the readr in a different direction when reading this.

By now im pretty sure you have a good understanding of what the author was trying to get across. You may ask why would people still want to explore in such harsh conditions, but the author does a great got of stating reasons why people such as astronoust still explore these harsh places. This gives good opportunity to discover something new and be credited for it. You never k ow you could be the next.
