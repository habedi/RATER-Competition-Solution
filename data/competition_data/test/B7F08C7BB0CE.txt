My argument of this aspects of the driverless cars i'm against it. The future cars may not always work or do come out right with the parts. When no one has to buy cars anymore can become a huge problem. That means that they don't have to pay car payments or anything on the car. How do they work right or how do they get around?

The future with public tansportation system where it has fleets of the driverless cars that form a public-tansport taxi system. The cars take half fo the fuel of the each day taxis and they offer more flexability than a bus. I wouldn't want to pay half of fuel taxis each day. He beleives that it's going to change the world. When it changes the world. People are going to complain because of the issuses that they are going to have with the future driverless cars.

When people watch televison or movies for how long they want with these care that could drive themsevles. How would the car know that movie is over and you want to go home and the car isn't back on time? Google cars shouldn;t have to drive indepently because it just makes people lazy all the time. There is pretty much a robot that you have to take care of everyday like a child.

The driverless cars may not know what they are dealing with when they leave the house with the person. People are just putting their life in danger with these driverless cars. Most people would be late to work, apportiments, etc. It can cause traffic issues, such as navigating through the roadwork or cause accidents. They should not send the future with driverless cars because it will cause way too many issuses for everybody.
