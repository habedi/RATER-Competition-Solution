Diverless car are a great idea and it world be fun to have them driveing around. Why not have cars around that can drive themself there would be so many positive thing that come from it, like it make for beter safe cars, tecnology world have to get beter, and good to start for new driver.

First, driverless car world be good for make a beter safe cars. At the start the car may not seem safe at first,but that why the we can just keep making them. So they first one not safe so we look and learn from your miskates just like we did for are space prgram he didn't get it right for the first time. If don't get it right the first time don't give up look at what you did wrong and learn from it.

Next, technologey well get beter. Your world today is constedly evoling, we got the hoverbored, Iphone7 Ps4&Xbox1,just a lot of new things all together,so why can't we have driverless cars? I think people asked that same question that why in 2013 the BMW annouced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant". The BMW company is readey to move on with the world and with new technology,why not follow in their footsteps.

Lastly, it a great way to get new driver ready for the rode. I now some people lean beter though audio and that what you can get though driverless cars. In the article they said something about google talking to you when yoy need to take control sometime. I know the compiny can dessin that to help new drivers of the rode and from we can worry less and less about new drivers.

So people might say that cars are safer when hand drive at the article say that ,also that people world get more lazy they they are now and cause more acidateed,But it simpley not true driverless car till require you to ready at all time if simething does go wroung and the car warrons you then you're resposible for it not the car. You can trust the car but not the driver.

Overall I think it world be a good idea to have driverless car take less strees out of drivering. When your in traffic just sit and think to yourself or watch tv thinking that you are going to be later for a imported meating. In not they car fult it the commuity.
