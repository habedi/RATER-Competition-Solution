To whom it may concern,

I believe that cellular devices or cell phones should be not allowed during free periods and lunch.

I Believe this because sometimes you need to contact family members, For example when there is an emergency going on with your family; someone is hospitalized, somebody has passed away , but that is not always the case.

I also see them as a distraction if being used for different reasons but, when these rules are made some people would like to be allowed to have them on campus, but the choices the district make are for our benefit in learning and succeeding in the real world.

In reality you cannot sit in your office and text the whole time you are there, so why start the bad habits now?

These devices are not bad but i believe it is not helping you to have them with either.

I understand some of the reasons other people would like to have the privilege to carry a cell phone but the way i see it most people do not follow the rules and take it out hiding it, and secretly texting or calling people.

Do not get me wrong i love having my cell phone but not being in contact with your family and friends for six hours will not kill anybody.

I know there will be many students now and to come that will disagree, but if you want to do well in school texting in class will not help you keep an "A" in any class.

Even having the temptation could be a distraction to your self and will not keep you focused.

Texting not only distracts you from the teacher some of the others around you can be distracted by it also.

So in conclusion I hope you see that this will not only benefit us but our grades because kids will have no choice but to pay attention.

Sincerely,
