Some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning over their break. Although some may disagree, teachers should design the project. Those who disagree state that students would be more involved if they designed it themselves or chose their own prompt, but these are simply not true. The best way a summer project should be carried out is with a teacher's design, and here's why.

First off, teachers are the ones who shall grade it, so they should be the ones who choose the guidelines for that grade. This gives teachers the ability to give all the students the same thing but pick out which projects were done good. If every student designed their own project then there would be no control for what is good and what is bad. On top of that, when students all have a teacher designed project it makes it so they have to reach a certain level of effort, and not just be lazy and write two sentences. Allowing students to design their own project would most definitely enable some more lazy projects.

In addition, some students prefer to have something structured and guided so they dont have to create everything from scratch. Projects can be hard to completely design without any loopholes or flaws. Some students simply lack the creativity to think up a whole project on their own. Projects could be anything, from a potato being observed to a summer book review. Giving students that much freedom would only cause confusion among them and the teacher trying to grade many very different projects. The projects would be incomparable, so how would a teacher be able to argue that one is bad and another isn't. What if students want to help each other on their projects? well they cant if every project is unique; however, if given a prompt they can cooperate and benefit from each other in creating a unique, yet immaculate project.

Although some may disagree, students should not be allowed to design their own summer projects, they would be less efficient and become easily not gradable. Those who disagree with this statement say that students feel more relaxed doing their own project, and are more enthusiastic if they have full creative control. However, these statements are simply not true. In the end, there is many reasons why teachers should control summer projects, and whether students like it or not, it is better for all if the teacher designs them.Â
