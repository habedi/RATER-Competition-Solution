Dear Principal,

I think that you shouldn't make this a policy change because many students study hard and do well and have a C average. If you change it to a B average a lot of students will be kicked off the team. A lot of the good players have C and they do fine academically and physically.

Me, myself do exceptionally well on the field and I have a C average and I would hate it if you changed that rule. Sports are really one thing that kids do well in school to play for but if you raise it to a B average many kids will not even try and maybe even rebel against you.

If you change the policy do you think a lot of the students that are struggling to keep a C average will even go for a B average? Think about it Mrs. Principal. If you have failing students do you think that will look good on you? On your staff? On your school?

Sincerely, 8th Grader
