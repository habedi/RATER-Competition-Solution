How would learning from home help a person, when learning from school is even more incredible . For example, at school, professors help students learn by instructing them with knowledge that will stick in their craniums. Students get to interact with their classmates and that helps them learn way better. Furthermore, teachers make it easier in school for the students to learn by teaching the information in their faces, while, online the students might have a question about how to work the website. Students wouldn't gain from learning at home because at school you get the full experience and you meet new people.

You'll obtain the full learning experience at school. For instance, when students learn at school, they have a teacher who is right in front of them, teaching a lesson to them. Students also have the opportunity to ask their teacher questions about what they're having trouble with or on a topic that their confused about. On the other hand, when human beings learn from home, it's harder for them to ask questions because the video chat could fail and your teacher might not be able to hear you from the loud disturbances of the classroom. Ultimately, this shows why having the full learning experience is way more helpful than learning a on stupid video chat that could crash during the lesson.

Meeting new people is way more enjoyable . For example, kids have a lot more excitement when they're at school because they're talking to people and making new friends. Also, that friend they made at school could be a long term friend in their life; which makes their life much more amazing . Similarly, my friend that I made when I was in second grade; he is now one of my best friends that I hang out with today. On the other hand, when learning at home, you can't meet any new friends and it's as boring as, "watching paint dry". This is why making new friends at school is cooler than being tired and bored at home.

Although learning from home would be easier than traveling to school everyday, students wouldn't get the full experience of being in a classroom, learning with a teacher in front of them, and classmates they get to talk to.

Why would students want to be at home and not being able to talk to their teacher face to face? Students wouldn't meet any new people and that would cause the students to be very bored

; then, they will be off task and wouldn't feel like learning. For example, if a student had a question about what they're learning, the video chat could crash and that would make the student feel very annoyed and it would take more time for the teacher to instruct their student. In summary, Learning at home is not as beneficial as obtaining important information in our heads at school.

Students wouldn't gain from learning at home because at school you get the full experience and you meet new people. At school, students learn better by learning from their teachers who are giving them the instruction in front of them, rather than from an electronic device. How would students ask important questions to their teachers? Having that full experience is way more important because students get to feel the learning environment and interact with their peers in the classroom. In the conclusion, not taking online classes at home, going to school and being in a learning environment with your fellow classmates is way more extraordinary and beneficial for your learning. Listen to this essay and go to school so that you can learn from the greatest teachers and meet the friend that will make your future fantastic
