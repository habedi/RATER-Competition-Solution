In May of 1976, a space ship that was looking for a landing site on Mars snapped a very interesting photo. The blurry photo clearly resembled a human face. The picture led a lot of people to think that the structure was build by aliens. However, this statement has been proven wrong by scientific evidence. The structure wasn't built by aliens because a more up to date photo of the same spot has proven that it is just a mass of rock.

Up until around 1998, a large amount of people believed that the image of the blurry face was evidence of an alien civilization. On April 5, 1998 however, scientists were finally ale to take another picture of the same spot with more up to date technology. The new image revealed that it was just a bunch of rocks.

Scientists say that the blurry face could've been caused by a thick haze that was on that part of the planet when the original photo was taken. They said it was a cloudy day when the photo was taken, so the fae could've been created by the combination of the clouds and the shadows.

Now that a more up to date photo was released, some people have dropped the whole idea of an alien civilization, however, some people still believe that there could still be alien life elswhere. This could be true, but as for the blurry face photo, it was all just a trick of the eye.
