Dear principle,

I agree that it would be a great idea to only allow the B average or higher to participate in sports. It wouldn't be fair to reward the students who don't try in school and don't care if they do bad. Even if there are students who do try, it would give them a good opportunity to try and do better. There would be much more students working hard and getting better grades. It would be a much better chance to see what our school is really capable of. Parents and teachers would be very proud and students would feel confident. This would be a good way in showing how much the students improved. Lots, of students are lacking off and not paying attention from marking period to marking period. Having this new rule would be A goal to reach for every student who wants to join a sport. If more kids do good, friends of their's might try and do good as well. Every body will know that the students on sports have good grades and they would be like roll models to every one else. I know that this would be a great idea and that students would do much better in almost everything when they grow up. The ecomidy today, is doing really bad and we need better jobs to make more money. If people earn more money they would be able to stimulate the ecomidy much better.

Sincerely, a student from SCHOOL_NAME.
