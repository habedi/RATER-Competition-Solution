I think that they should let us bring cell phones to school if it is off during class. We can use it during lunch and recess. It would be better for us with out interrupting class because, they go off in class. People love to talk, text, and get on the internet. They can do all that on their phones and it will also pass the time. We don't always go to recess because, they can only dismiss so many students to the gym when it is raining outside. When we are in for recess we can use our cell phones to do things. We may even need to use it for an emergency.

Now that i got the positive out of the way lets think about the negative. Students may forget to turn off their phones and may interrupt class. Their phone could get lost or stolen. They could get grounded for loosing their phone. They could be texting in class and get their phone taken away and make their parent come and pick it up. All these things don't happen very often though.

Now that we have seen the positives and the negatives there are more positives than negatives. There are several good things and very few bad things. So there should be phones in school. I'm pretty sure your see the point, it is very easy to see. Now the principal decides on the rule.
