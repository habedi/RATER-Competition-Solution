People have been driving for many years. Cars today have evolved dramastically since the first car came out. Since we have new technology, it means that we have more non-fuel efficient cars. We need to think of a way to cut out all the negative things that cars give us. Paris, for example is banning cars that have an even numbered license plate on Monday. Bogota, Columbia is also banning cars and telling people to find an alternative transportation. Lastly Vauban, Germany is demanding to be "car-free".

Paris has had days of near-record pollution, so they had to think of a plan to reduce the pollution in the air. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home of pay a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the crime.

In Bogota, Columbia millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during the car-free day. This day has been going on for 3 years. People faced $25 fine if they violated this event. Citizens were saying that "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower the air pollution". Parks and Sports Centers have been built, old un-even sidewalks have been smoothed out and rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

In Vauban, Germany residents of this upscale community are giving up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experiment of being car-free. Car ownership is allowed but there are only 2 places to park; large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space for 40,000, along with a home. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57% sold a car to move here.

Even though many people still own cars, they still give off bad things for our enviroment. Many cars produce a gas that is bad for the air. Many countries have banned cars on certain days to cut down on air pollution. Paris makes you pay a fine if you are caught driving a car on a certain day. Bogota, Columbia has a specific day that cars are banned and you have to find a different way of transportation. Lastly, Vauban, Germany is demanding to be car-free and have certain ways to have cars but pay for them. If we can keep making acceptions of taking different ways of transportation then maybe we can cut down on air pollution for good.
