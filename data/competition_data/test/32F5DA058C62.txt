Do you use a cell phone when you drive ? I know people use their cell phones for just about everything. But unfortunately people are choosing to use their cell phones at the wrong time, while they are driving which is very dangerous not only to themselves but others on the road as well. I personally don't think phones should be used while driving do you ?.

Cell phones are used in our daily life in this day and age, but sometimes it could be dangerous for us to use them like while driving. Using a cellphone while driving is dangerous not only for the driver but everyone out there on the road as well. When driving with a cell phone it is sometimes hard to focus on the road which is putting your life and others life at risk. Everyday people die in car accidents because they made the choice to use a cellphone while driving.

According to research cell phones are the main cause of accidents, and studies show that using a cell phone while driving puts drivers at a four time greater risk of a car accident.

There are people that believe that having a cell phone while driving is ok, because they believe that sending a text message only takes your eyes off the road for a few seconds, but what they do not know is that in those few seconds something terrible could happen. When a cell phone is used you don't think about your surroundings and how it may affect others around you that's how it is when driving and using a cell phone. The number one cause of car accidents just so happen to be distracted driving. Also increases the number of deaths per year.

In conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving, sending a quick text message or checking your phone is not worth losing your life or someone else's. I believe that doing so would be inconsiderate of other drivers and also pedestrians as well. Also it is illegal in many states. There are other ways than a cell phone to communicate that are less dangerous for example a bluetooth earpiece. But don't use the phone for the safety of yourself and others.
