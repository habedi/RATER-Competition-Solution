Summer is usually where I have most of my fun. I am always working, playing football, and hanging out with friends. Usually I dedicate most of my free time to things I love doing on my break, but sometimes when I have to do school related things, I like when I get to pick the summer project rather than the teacher to pick it. I think if the students get to pick the summer projects they want to do, it will probably lead to a better and more exciting project rather then a boring project which was required to do.

I think if most students get to pick the summer project they want to do, they will find their topic more interesting, therefore making the project more enjoyable. If the summer projects become more enjoyable, students would actually want to them and not forget or ignore the projects until school starts back again. Especially since students are on summer vacation, most students will not do anything school-related or even the projects, but if they do it on something they enjoy, they would likely do it instead of slacking off. Students who tend to hate school may do projects if the projects are based on something they like or something they find interesting. Most students would actually have a passion and might even enjoy the projects they get to pick to do in the summers.

I also believe the students will have more fun doing summer projects they enjoy rather than what the teacher picks for the students . Since students have more freedom and more say on what topics their summer projects will be on, I think the students would put more effort and more excitement into the summer projects. Projects that tend to be interested by the students can lead to a better projects since the students actually know the topics they like and choose those topics to do summer projects on them. Making summer projects more enjoyable could lead to students maybe liking school due to the freedom they get to pick went they choose their own summer projects instead of the teacher assigning the topics. And since the students get to pick their own topics, they will have more passion doing the projects, therefore leading to better projects and grades for the students and easier grading and less work for teachers.

Lastly I believe that if students go to pick their own summer topics for their projects, they will finish it quicker and get it over with as soon as possible instead of waiting last minute to complete the projects. Since the students get to pick their projects, they would be able to finish it in no time due to their topic being interesting and their topics being enjoyable. Since students would most likely pick a topic they enjoy, their knowledge of the topic might be big or they might do a lot of research due to they wanting to find new information out, thus helping them finish this project easier and faster than other projects. Some people think that if teachers gave out topics for summer projects it would be more educational and better, but these people are wrong because if the students got to pick out there summer project topics, they would be able to enjoy it a little more and it would be more enjoyable to the students. Also if the students got to pick their topics for their summer projects, they would probably get it done with quickly so they could be able to do a lot more activities like hanging out with people or play sports or even work and since the topic they picked was something they had interested in, they would be glad to get it over with.

In conclusion, all these reasons that were stated in this essay are good reasons on why schools should let the students pick their topics for summer projects instead of the teaching picking them out for them. Letting the students pick what topics they want to do for summer is an easier way to make the projects more exciting and better learning for the students. People should care about letting the students pick their topics because if they want to research more about a certain topic, this will allow them to able to research it more in depth and help the knowledge of the student grow more.Â
