Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that students should be allowed to play sports with a grade C average. Many students have great athletic ability's but cant keep up a B average. Also a C is still a passing grade so why shouldn't they be able to play sports? If you were a very great athlete and you made a C on your report card would you be mad that you couldn't get to play any sports?

Sports are a privilege but keeping up a B average can sometimes be hard for some students.

Having a C to some people is not acceptable, but for others having a C could be great. If all you were use to was making F' s and you got a C that would make you feel great.

Some people are not as academically inclined as others are. You cant expect every athlete to make a B. all your doing is hurting the team and the kid. That team could be all the child has and you are taking it away from them. So really think about it their both passing grades.

School sports are a great way to get in shape, have fun, and hang around with your friends. If a child can pull off a C they should be able to play on the sports team. If the grade is lower than a C it might be better to discuss the problem with the student and work something out. But all I'm saying is it could be maybe an 84 and that's only one point from a B. There shouldn't be a major punishment for that.

If the child doesn't make a C then you could talk to their parents about it and discuss whether they should play or not. If the grade is just way down their than take them off the team but a c is still a pretty high grade. Anybody can make a mistake and one test could decide whether you made a B or a C. If that's the case then their shouldn't be any problem in that.

Students should be able to play sports with atleast a C average. Making it a B could hurt the schools sports teams really badly. in my opinion a C is a fair enough grade to have to play school sports. Please think about this and think about when you were in school. before you make this decision really think about who this could affect and why. Thank you for your time and please think about what I have to say.
