Dear, Prinicipal

I think that you should allow students to bring cell phones to school and let use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. If you allow us to use our cell phones during lunch periods and free time it would keep us from getting into trouble for having them during school. Also parents would not have to come to school to just pick up our cell phones. Now days kids are getting in trouble mainly because of their cell phone going off during class or it falls out of their pocket. But why are we not aloud to have cell phones? Another good reason for letting use our cell phones is because some students have extra ciricail activities after school and what if the child needs to remind there parents to pick them up after school. What if a student forgets their homework at home and the school want let them call their parents so they can bring the homework to the child so he/she don't get a bad grade for their homework assignment. So really think about it, students should be able to use their cell phone during lunch periods and other free times the student may have. T

Sincerely,
