Student-Designed Summer Project

Every student looks forward to summer, it's the time when you get to have fun and not be stressed out about homework. However, some teachers give summer projects that need to be completed. Students dread doing these because they feel like it's taking time away from what is supposed to be their break from school. Sometimes it's necessary for schools to assure students continue to learn during their summer break. However, summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more responsibility, it's a way for students to express themselves, and there is a higher chance of completion.

Firstly, if students are in charge of their own summer projects it gives them more responsibility. Having a summer project is a responsibility on its own because most students don't want to worry about school while they are on their break, but giving students the chance to create their own can teach them more than if a teacher were to create the project. For example, if students would like to learn more and challenge themselves, they are going to make their projects more difficult, which can help their future education. Letting students take control can also teach them time management because they need time to create their project, complete it and enjoy their summer. It is obvious that letting students create their own project is more beneficial because it gives them more responsibility.

Secondly, giving students a chance to design their own project can help them express themselves. A student is more likely to do an assignment if it involves something they are interested in. If an English teacher were to give a book to read over the summer and write a summary about it, most students would not complete it or put no effort into it. Students don't want to spend their summer writing essays. If students were in control of the project they could use a hobby or talent to complete the assignment. For example, some students find producing videos interesting, so they could create a trailer of the book summarizing it instead of writing an essay. This shows letting students show off their creativity can make a summer project enjoyable.

Finally, letting students come up with their own project, that they can personalize, will make them want to complete it. If a teacher were to do it, they would procrastinate or not finish it. Every student procrastinates, it's just part of being in school. When summer comes around students forget about everything that is school related.

School is the last thing students think about when they're on break, so summer projects should be something students want to do, and will enjoy doing so they don't forget about it. Obviously if students design a summer project that fits their interests they're more likely to complete it.

Many would say that students wouldn't learn from creating their own project because students would make it too easy, and it would make it hard for teachers to grade. However, students learn at different paces and have different abilities. Hence why giving every student the same project is not fair because some might be spending more time of their break working on it than others. As if the students had the ability to design it, they know what they're capable of, and how much they can learn from the assignment. When it comes to grades, teachers should have a rubric and as long as students have what's necessary for the project then it won't be difficult to grade. Also, letting students come up with their summer projects would give teachers less work to do. Students should have the chance to design their own summer project because it can make both the teachers's and students' lives easier.

In conclusion, students can express themselves, complete the assignment on time, have more responsibilities and prepare for the future, if they are able to design their own summer project. A couple months before school ends all they can think about is summer, how close they are to being done with school. Except they are not because they have a summer project to work on, but if they are able to design it then it will be more beneficial. Creating a summer project will benefit the student more than doing one designed by the teacher. Schools should consider this preposition because it makes it easier for the teacher and enjoyable for the student.
