Dear Principal:

I believe that cell phones cause problems when students are using them during class for texting, or going on the internet. However, they are very important for a student to have during the day. That is why I think Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the best policy.

The main reason why I think that policy 1 is better is because the students may need their phone if they need some way to communicate with their parents before and after school. The students may need it if they find out their sport's practice is canceled, and they don't have a ride. They may also need to contact someone if there is some sort of emergency and they need help.

However, students may also need their phones during the day as well. My older sister is a freshmen this year, but when she started at high school, she often times got lost so she would call her friends and ask them for help. Another important reason that students should be allowed to have their phones during the day is if they aren't feeling well and they need to come home for the rest of the day, they can call their parents or a friend to come pick them up.

I believe that if a student is taking advantage of there privilege of even having a phone at school, and they are using it for social purposes, it should be taken away. But if a student does get caught, the teacher that confiscated it should return it to the owner after that class period. If a certain teacher is having problems with too many students having their phones out during class time, they should have every student place their phone at the far corner of their desk so the teacher can see everyone's phone and make sure no one is being distracted by them.

If you use policy 2, I believe that students will feel like they have to sneak their phones into class, and that may cause a bigger problem. If students start taking in their phones secretly, more and more of them may get used to it and eventually start taking them out during class and you will end up in the same situation you are in right now. If you end up in this situation again, you will have to make more policies.

Sincerely,
