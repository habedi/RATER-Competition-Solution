The author effectively communicate his claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. "NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simualting the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condition". "By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces". These evidence proves how NASA are trying different approaches and they are making different kind of new technology so they can withstand the harsh condition of Venus, and striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
