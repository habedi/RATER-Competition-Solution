The face was just made by the sand moving around. The face shouldn't be this big of a deal. Just because it looks like a face doesn't mean someone made it like that. But to others it may seem like aliens did do it. But they think what they want but aliens don't exist.

The face is not that big of a deal. The face is a way for organizations to sell their products. As it says in the fifth paragraph, "The 'face on mars' has become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!". All the face is is sand that has been moved around by sand storms and now it looks like a face nothing fun about it. All I'm saying is the face is not as great as it once seemed.

Even though the face really means nothing, some people thinkthat the face was made by life on mars. They say that they made it to show that they were there. "The face is bona fide evidence on mars". But we also know that sand storms are very common on Mars, how could it not just be one of those that did it?

The face is not as amazing as everyone was making it out to be. It is just sand that happened to make a face when it blew together. In conclusion, I feel that the face is not as big of a deal as it was made out to be.
