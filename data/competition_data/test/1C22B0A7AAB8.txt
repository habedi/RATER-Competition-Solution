Most students adapt to society by the environment of school life. Therefore, if every school were to offer online education our society would weaken. Online schooling does not benefit the majority of students. Most students do not consider online schooling as an option because they would miss out on so many activities. In addition, it is very difficult to make friends their age if more students were home schooled.

Majority of the students who have considered online schooling as an option, only consider it because they simply do not want to do the work that the school has provided them. Some students do not take school seriously and find online schooling as a safe route. Therefore, those that take advantage of online schooling make it unfair for students who go to school and take their education seriously. In addition, those who attend school from home do not have to wake up as early as the students who attend regular school. Most students find that as a good thing, but in reality, school is just preparing them for when they are adults and have to wake up that early every single day.

Some students who are home schooled will have a harder time adjusting to the real world. Therefore, attending online school will not be beneficial to their future in the long run. Also, some schools do not offer online schooling because it is difficult to find someone who has the ability to teach a student who is home schooled. Online schooling is both not beneficial to the student and school district as well. After students graduate and become adults, they have a tough time adapting by being on their own. Therefore, when the students that were home schooled graduate, they not only have to adapt to being a young adult but also society as well.

Some people think that online schooling is beneficial to those who are unable to able to attend school regularly. Although, that may be true for the ones that are severely ill, however, there other options than home schooling. Education should be every students top priority. Without being properly educated nobody can ultimately survive in today's society.

Therefore, someone who is home schooled can not be properly educated because they will not have the proper resources and life skills to survive in today's society.

Although, most schools offer online schooling it is not beneficial to students in the long run. Our society as a whole would weaken if more students attend school at home. Those who are home schooled miss out on so many extracurricular opportunities. Students who attend school at home have so much potential, but without attending regular school they do not have most of those opportunities. Students who attend regular school are better prepared for when they graduate and are on their own. School is only preparing students for the real world, and in order to survive in today's society someone has to have been properly educated.Â After students graduate the people at school or at home will not be there to guide them through society.
