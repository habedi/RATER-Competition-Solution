I agree students should participate in extracurricular activities during school ,

students need a break sometimes to enjoy what they think is fun no matter if it's sports or helping students with work or helping the school and teachers even if its bringing supply, students should have a choice to pick what they want to do in school, of course it must be school appropriate but students should be able to pick what they want not have principals and teachers pick what they think or want them to do students should be able to pick something there passionate about what makes them want come to school.

I said what makes them want to come to school because some students are miserable when they come to school, they feel like they hate school and they dont want to be there students get in trouble more because they don't want to be there they need something to look forward to, by having extra curricular activities during school they will look forward to something they enjoy they'll have a more positive attitude because there doing something they are passionate about something they like to do to keep them occupied by doing this students will want to come to school more.

Some activities should be with multiple people working with multiple people, not only does this build character and leadership skills but it helps with social skills which helps students communicate more so when students get upset with teachers they can walk away from the problem and not talk back instead of them taking there anger out on teachers this is why students get into trouble, they dont know how to walk away from a situation or they dont know how to accept defeat that they cant win a argument with an adult students shouldn't even be arguing with adults but sometimes they feel like there right and the teacher is wrong, students don't know how to communicate with there peers by having competitive activities they'll learn to walk away from a problem they'll eventually get tired of arguing or they'll accept defeat, although there's no guarantee teachers can always teach the students with competitive games like checkers or a thinking game they get beat to many times so they quit.

Some students need to communicate or need human interaction some students are worried they dont fit in so they don't talk to people and some people cant make friends as well as others so they dont talk to people much this is where students may get diagnosed with illnesses like depression from being bullied or other hardships they have to face in there life as people we dont know what everybody goes threw, some people aren't comfortable with telling people ether they keep it bottled in and they dont get out much, this is why we need team building activities so those people could fit in and get around with people make friends too the more they work together they build trust and a bond as team.

So yes I agree with the statement that was made because it betters us as people so we should have extracurricular activities to better the education and improve the attitude of students and maybe more students would show up again maybe not everybody will agree or like my idea but that's my opinion to better our education so take it into consideration.
