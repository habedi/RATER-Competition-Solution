I really like the fact technology has changed over time by smart people who have the time and committment to make our community a better place. It is really hard to tell emtion sometimes. There's sometimes people who have a relaxed face, but is happy. I totally agree with the computer technology to tell emotion for paintings and illustrations. Although, I wouldnt recommend using it on students maybe for some people, but not for all. Certain students could take that very personal like "invading their privacy" situation type, but I certaintly wouldn't use it on students.

Constructing a 3-D model of the face of a painting or illustration I could understand that, but having the audacity to invade someones space would be a totally different story, when you could just ask them about their problems or just to even check up on them. Severall of students could take in the process personal, beause they might not want people to know that they're upset or angry only for the simple fact people can go and spread your business, or maybe they don't want to talk.

Permission of using it on students also matters. You're not just going to walk up to any person, take a picture of them, and then run away with it. Something is going to be said. The technology of it is so cool, but personally used on students, The professors and any other users have got to be out of their minds to use it for such reasoning on students. Realizing expressions throughout other humans are very common, only because we know what the emotions of sad, happy, excited, scared look like. We can tell when there's something wrong, because that's just our humanly instincts.

Supporting my evidence as to "Most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication," notes Dr. Huang. "Some computers need to understand that too." I totally disgaree with that though computers shouldn't know all personal information on how which and who feels some kind of way when you can talk out their problems. They don't have to have a happy face to be happy, or a sad face to be sad. There are people who hide their feelings deep down inside faking their emotion on the outside. A lot of things you can't just "up and tell" human instincts don't work like that.

Came to thought that all technology is not meant for human interactions. Again, invading space just is not healthy or right for other people. Some may want to be left alone, not bothered with. Especially without permission. Things could change within the matter of seconds. Emotions are so common eve with the looks on their face, but there are going to be a lot times where other people hide them. Personal things just shouldn't be shared or forced on someone. No permission, not to be bothered with. Want to be alone? Leave them. Space is important.
