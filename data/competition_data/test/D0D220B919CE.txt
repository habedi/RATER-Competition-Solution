The author supports the idea that studying venus is a Worthy pursuit depite the dangers by saying, "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahernheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on own planet . Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any pkanet in our solar system, even though meercury is closer to out sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additonal impediments like erpting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. NASA's possible soultion to the hositle conditions on the surface of Venes would allow scientists to flot above the fry. just as out jet airplanes travle at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly gound conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirthy-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure woud be close to tht of sae levle on Earth. solar power woukd be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Noe easy conditions, but survivable for humans. more inportantly, researcher cnnot take samples or rock,gas,or anything else, from a destance. therefore, scientists seeking to the conduct thorugh mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
