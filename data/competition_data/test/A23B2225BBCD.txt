Students all have benefits in and out of school some may struggle, while others school comes easy to them. Others my even have a hard time getting to school. This may lead some students to question themselves about even going to school. Students would benefit from being able to attend class from home by way of online or video conferencing because it helps them to stay on task and get work done, more flexible with students personal life, finally students may feel more comfortable and safe at home. These are reasons why students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Students tend to get distracted and go off task leading them not getting there work done. for an example Generic_Name and his friends are working on a group project together in English class, Generic_Name and Generic_Name start to get distracted by talking to other students about video games. Generic_Name and Generic_Name don't realize they wasted 25 talking to other students and the rest of the students turned their assignment in except for Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Therefore This lead to them getting a bad grade on a big assignment in class. Students sometimes dont even notice there getting distracted or caught off guard but it seems to happen frequently in school environments. Getting distracted is a very easy thing when students are around people that they know or even sometimes they dont know. Students will even consider going home schooled to keep focused and stay on task. Students would benefit from online or even video conferencing just to get the grades they want and not getting distracted and to stay on task.

Scholars have a big and busy life on and off school campus. Some we have no idea about. For an example Generic_Name is a D1 athlete in Virginia and attends high school. Generic_Name has a hard time planning trips and college meetings due to his classes in school. Therefore Generic_Name got emails from colleges saying there are no longer interested in him anymore due to lack of appearance. After everything happened Generic_Name lost his scholarship to Generic_School from not showing up and lack of interest. In the long run it was his high school work and classes that ruined his chance. If Generic_Name would have had the option to attend class from home or even online, Generic_Name would have benefited from that opportunity and would have accomplished his high school classes and his D1 scholarship to Generic_School. Students have a lot of responsibilities and goals in life and sometimes school can play a huge role in students lifestyle.

Although majority of students feel like there school environment is a free safe place others may feel a whole lot different. For an example Generic_Name has been going to high school in Generic_City for 2 years now. Him and his buddies decide to go eat lunch outside that evening and enjoy the beautiful day. 10 minutes go past until all of a sudden they hear gunshots coming from inside the building and people are running, screaming, and shouting. The school was evacuated and police and firemen showed up moments later. Eventually they got news that no one was hurt or injured. Generic_Name has still not been able to go back to school because of this horrible scenery. Student have possibly witnessed terrible things in their school environments and not feel safe or comfortable leaving there homes. Having the option of online or staying at home to do classwork would gradually benefit students that dont feel safe.

Finally, attending classes online from home or even video conferencing would benefit students tremendously throughout all there hardships they come across from the time there in school. School is a great place for learning, socializing, and meeting new people everyday. For others they might feel a different way from others and online or staying at home while attending school opens a new door for all students and parents to choose from. Overall student would succeed more in school by having the option of online or home because every student has a different home life, may feel safer at home, and finally to stay on task and focused.
