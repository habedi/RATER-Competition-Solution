The principal of the school decided to make students do extracurricular work. I do not agree with this decision,for there are many things that affect students daily lives and adding more would be quite troublesome. Although it would not be that horrible if they had more options to appeal to a wider group.

One of the ways this is a bad idea is because many students have little siblings to take care of,and making them stay at school can be hurting them more than helping them. Although it would help the student with social skills and teamwork,but most students just cant make the time frame. The students would need to be home at the regular time because their parents might have to go to work and they need someone to make sure the house won't burn down. You,however might counter argument with they are adults and need to be responsible for their actions.

For example if a student had more physical strength and leadership ability then they would obviously do football. However what about people who want to cook or do chess. Although it would not be bad if they had more clubs to choose from. But the principal is not giving them enough ability to express themselves if they dont have a club for everyone to enjoy. If there were more options I would be as opposed as there would be a choice for everyone,but the principal is not letting them go home on time if the activity is after school.

There are a plethora of reasons not to go to an after school activity,but then they do improve important social skills. These are some of my arguments and counterarguments for why the principal should not make students have a after school activity. What is your opinion on the topic?
