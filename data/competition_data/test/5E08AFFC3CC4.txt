There are many advantages to limiting the use of cars. Some advantages to limititing are car use is drastically reducing greenhouse gas, Reduce smog, and to support having a healthy life-style.

"To drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes." (

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

)

Green house gasses cause so much harm to the world today by breaking up the o-zone layer and letting to much UV light into our atmosphere. most people dont know this but car are responcible for 12 persent of the greenhouse gasses in Eurpoe.

I do not  know what else to write.

In Europe the smugg problem is so bad that they started to fine people for using their car. Europe wanted to put charges because their smog was getting so bad that most of their people had lung problems.

To help spport a healthy life style you have to be active. To acheve this goal people need to do active things like walking, jogging, or runing  to their destinations. for example people can go to the mall or to their local park to hang out and get some physical activity.

As you can see physicall activiy and saving the world are imporant things that we as people need to understand to have a future on this Earth. To improve the earth.
