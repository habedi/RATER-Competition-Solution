Dear Editor

I believe that the policy our principal is trying to make is a good idea because, if you do not put in enough time to do your homework and study for a test then why should you be able to waist valuable study time on a sport and end up with a D or an F?

Students should maintain at least a C average to be able to play sports.

If there was a kid who got a scholarship to a college for sports, which is good, but only for sports and he failed most of his classes, where would he go in life?

School is supposed to prepare you for a good future and help you make good decisions.

Also, since only a fraction of all careers are sports related and only a fraction of people will make them, a kid should have a good education.

Also, if you were just as good as a kid at, lets say basketball, but he was failing and you had an A.

Would you enjoy it if that kid got to start and you didn't?

How about if you were a straight A student, and you made High Honor Role, then the school has an awards ceremony, and you didn't get an award, but the highest scorer on the basketball team did?

I think that the principal's decision would be a good one for all the students and their futures.
