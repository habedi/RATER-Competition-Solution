Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe requiring students to perform community service is a spectacular idea.

Helping out the community around us is so generous and all 600 students here at SCHOOL_NAME

could really make a huge impact.

It will teach many of us lessons that we will carry throughout life.

To begin with, generosity and benevolence are both great traits to possess.

Having the opportunity to help out the less fortunate around us will help us learn how to have these characteristics.

There are many families and people in our community that don't have heat in this cold winter, can't afford groceries and food to feed their family, have lost their jobs, or don't even have a home to live in.

I believe we often take for granted what all of our privileges.

For instance, many kids are upset or get annoyed with all of the work at school.

However, we should be grateful for being able to get an education and learn so much.

Overall, I believe doing hours of community service and helping people is priceless.

Next, participating in this experience is bound to teach every single student a lesson that they will be able to apply to many circumstances in their future.

For example, one child could learn that giving is better than receiving.

This lesson could be taught by going to soup kitchens and donating goods, or even serving food at a homeless shelter.

Last year, a friend and I decided to give back to the community around us.

We volunteered at a local homeless shelter and served dinner to all of the people there.

Every time one of them would say, "Thank you" I would feel so excited.

To know that they appreciate simple act, meant the world to me.

Another lesson they could learn would be that everyone could make a difference.

If all 600 students at this school contributed in community service, a huge result would be seen.

Furthermore, students contributing time to help the struggling people in their community is such a great idea.

I believe that if students think that it is getting in the way of activities that they would rather do, they will learn after the first few times how much more other people and families need it.

All in all, students contributing time to do community service is a marvelous idea.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
