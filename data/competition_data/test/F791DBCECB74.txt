Should summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? In my opinion they should be teacher-designed. Why? you might ask. Well if there teacher-designed you would already know what to do, all you have to do is follow instructions. With a teacher designed project it will also be more put together and less confusion. And you wouldnt have to worry about finding a topic or how should you go about things.

As you know students tend to procrastinate. So if we were to design our own project do you still think we would procrastinate? The answer to that question is yes. If we were to have the opportunity to design our own project we wouldnt have the right mindset. Most students mindset towards a project of their choice is "oh I already know what I want to do it'll be easy Ill do it a week before school." Then a week before school your stressed and trying to throw everything together. And when you get to school you'll blame it on the teachers as if their the ones who told you to wait till last minute. Even though they gave you the opportunity to design your own project, and do it on something you were eager about.

The goal of a summer project is to make sure that students are still getting some type of education during the summer. Teacher designed projects would have more of a lesson to it than a student designed one. There would actually be a reasoning to the project. A student designed project would be more of what they like based project. In order to know that the student is gaining information from the project I feel as if it should be created by the teacher.

Students come back to school from summer break completely clueless of anything they have learned last year. And in order to make sure that this doesnt keep happening each generation teachers have to design a summer project. Notice I said teachers not students. Teachers went to school ,and got their GED or diploma. So they know more than we do so they can insure that we get all the information we need.

In conclusion teachers want the best for students they wouldnt create a project were it isnt benefiting the student. Their job is to educate us and make sure we get the proper information we need. Teachers have sat in school ,and has had years of experience in the education department. Do you think a student would actually put thought into a summer project that would take away from their summer. No they wouldnt I know I wouldnt at least thats why summer projects should be teacher designed.Â
