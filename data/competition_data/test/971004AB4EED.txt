" OK class sital down we are going to start class"

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I believe, that it would be easy to do classes at home. Because you would be able to do them when you want to. For example if you had things to do or you have to clean the house and take care of your siblings you would be able to do you classes later with out stressing out. Like me i would prefer to take classes at home for that reason that i wouldn't have to be worrying about if I got my work done on time. Or you have to do does and that when you can just do it later.

Second, reason I think it would be easier to take classes at home because you wouldn't have to deal with people goofy around or people being so loud that you can't hear the teacher and you are trying to learn but you can't. Also there would be peace and quit, no one to bother you just you alone doing whatever you have to do. And I think you would get your work done faster. Therefore you would have more free time.

This is why I do think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home! Also it would stop teachers from talking to much. And having half of the class asleep.

I really think schools should let students have classes at home more because you could probably graduate early and get your diploma, start working and get money and do something with your life you never know.
