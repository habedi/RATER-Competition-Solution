Driverless Cars: Where are They?

Driverless cars, a dream many people have had ever since they heard of the idea. A world where you don't have pay as much attention to the road as you usually have to while driving a normal car, is such an absolutely fantastic idea and one I can't belive that nobody has invented before. Now I'm well aware that there are many skeptics out there that do not support the idea that driverless cars would be a good thing, but I feel that having modes of transportation where you don't have to constantly be alert of your surroundings and have a miniscule posibility of causing acidents is the perfect mode of transportation.

The first reason I suppot the development of driverless cars is the decreased likelyhood of accidents. Hundreds of people die every year due to car accidents and rekless driving. If those numbers can drop at a substancial rate with driverless cars, then thats a beautiful thing. Lives can be saved and a lot of people would be saved a lot of heartache.

Being able to focus on other things while being in the driver's seat of a car would be a great thing for many busy people on the move. Dealing with work while on the move would be a great thing for many people who have to take phone calls from clients while in the car. Being able to use a phone and not have to worry about getting in an accident would be the most wonderful feature any car could ever have.

Doing things in the car would be great, but I'm so glad that people would still have some control in their vehicles. The safety features presented in the artice state that if there is road work going on in the surrounding area the car would alert the driver, and the driver can take immediate control of the vehicle at any time. This safety feature is ingenious as it makes the driver aware of any road blocks or hazzards that may present themselves on the road at any given time.

Driverless cars are a creation that has taken way to long to make. I'm really wondering if they had just been lazy and just now started to to work an them. Cars that are completely safe and self aware of it's surroundings will be amazing. The pros of driverless cars far outway those of the cons, whatever those are.
