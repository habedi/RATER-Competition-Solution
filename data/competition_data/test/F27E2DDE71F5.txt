Dear principal,

I think we should be part of the community service because that way the student can learn not to litter. It will also make the schools much cleaner and a cleaner school means a cleaner community. It will also teach the students some good deeds. For example, cleaning is part of responsibility and caring for your community. If we take the other side we are just going to end up messing up the schools and the community. I'm pretty sure we do not want that now. we all want a healthier more clean looking neighbor hood or even community. But it first starts here in school. Yes, we are going to take time away from them, but what do teenagers do when on their spare time? They eat and litter. That's why if we start community service we would keep the streets, schools, and the community cleaner. We would also keep the teenagers from doing what they do best which is littering. Littering is bad for both you and the community. It makes are community look dirty, but not only that, it also makes are plants, crops, and are grass from growing healthy. We could of been getting rich soil good crops, plants, grass, and furthermore. But instead we're getting the opposite which is pollution. That's all i got to respond. So now it's on you principals is either cleaner society or just the way it is pure pollution.
