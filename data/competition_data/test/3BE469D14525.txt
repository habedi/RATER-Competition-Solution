The Facial Action Coding System is a new software that developes the improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The system has six basic emotions-happiness, surpise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characeteristic movements of the facial muscles. The software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared againest a neutral face (showing no emotion. How does it work? The process begines when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

The argument talks about if the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable or not. The technology will idnetify what the students behavior is like. If a student doesn't want to show what they are feeling, the technology will solve it out. Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.

I think this technology is not valuable in a student's classroom. The student's emotional expressions will be easy to find out what they are feeling because it's in person. Mona Lisa painting needed the technolgy because no one knows what she is feeling like. This technology will be good use for paintings, pictures, etc, that it can't be expressed. The technology should only be used for educational purposes, not to find out what the student is feeling in daily. It is easy to see a genunie smile and a fake one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth.
