Dear Principal,

I think that students are required to perform community service. If we don't then all of the students will focus more about themselves then others. A simple task, like picking up trash around the neighborhood, if not done then our streets will clog up the streets and it would be hard to get around from one place to another. Another example is tutor little kids with their work. If they don't get help then there is a slight chance that they will not get to higher grade levels. There is also some more consequences for not doing community service. Also I think we should offer some rewards like stickers or pencils. There are some people out in the community that need are help and we shouldn't just ignore it.

Some people even do community service, but they don't do their share of it. They just basically do some of the work then just leave to do other things they want to do. I think we should put consequences for the students that bail out of the service their doing. Some ideas for consequences should be more homework, stay after school for a little while, or put community service as a grade. If we do that then students understand why community service is important. So in conclusion, I think we should require all students to perform community service.

Sincerely,
