Dear,

Principle

I think that the students should be allowed to use there cell phones during free time. It is not like they are going to cheat on a test because they are at lunch. But i also think that they really don't need them unless they have to text there parents. They really don't need them because they are at school with all of there friends so who do they need to text because all there friends are with them. before the students go into class they should have to drop their phones into a bin so they do not get tempted to text during class. When they have free time they should be able to use them because after all it is free time. They should also be able to use them at lunch because they might need to text there parents or a friend to tell them what time to pick them up or to bring them lunch because they forgot theirs. The second rule about not letting students have a cell phone at school at all is a bad idea to me. They should be able to use there phone because they might need them and they are the same as going on a computer at lunch because you can still email people and go on the internet. So why should you not be able to use cell phones if you can use computers. I think that you should pass the first policy instead of the second because all the students would enjoy being able to use them at lunch.
