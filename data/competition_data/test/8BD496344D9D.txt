Why do you think aliens created it? Aliens did not create this it is a natural landform. The face breaks and gets more real each couple of years. If aliens created this then they couldn't of had NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face of Mars , it is a mesa. A mesa is natural so therefor it has to be a natural landform. I think it is real because they got a lot of facts about the mesa and if it was fake they couldn't of gotten facts on it. They seen a image and the note said it was a human head. Now if it was created by aliens and then it couldn't be a human head. I think it is real and so should you. Believe what they say becaue it is real and they are not making it up. This mesa was not created by aliens. Aliens are not even real in the real world. So believe what they say because i think it is real. If you dont think it is real then see if you can find facts about maybe even more facts than they found. If you cant find more facts then them it is obviously not true about it be created by aliens.
