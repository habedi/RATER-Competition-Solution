The face on Mars is something found commonly in American West or Mars. There have been people who dislike what NASA had to say about this picture, because at the beggingn NASA didnt know what it was for a fact.

NASA started focusing on this more and more. as it says in the article "Its not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin."

Well they beggingned to take a photo of this object every year and the more they study on it the more it came to there minds that it wasnt a face and had to be something else. Many scienctists were taking a shot and believing the face was an alien artifact. Well as this got more interesting and popular to the world NASA had one day many years later, found out that this Face that people were saying it was had been a landform. In the article it states "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West." This proves that NASA has proof for this picture, that the people that had been disagreeing with NASA can no longer disagree because of what NASA put in for this to be proved it wasnt a face.
