Some schools require students to to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. There is an ongoing debate over whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Though there are those who argue these summer projects should be teacher-designed, this is not true. Although some may disagree, these projects should be student-designed.

There are various reasons these summer projects should be student-designed. One, these projects would not be so daunting a task to undertake, so students would be less overwhelmed. Many students become overwhelmed by the daunting task of fulfilling the requirements of their assigned summer projects, so they put it off till the last minute. Instead of turning in a what could have been a well executed project, if left to their own devices, the results are shoddy and incomplete. Additionally, students are more likely to to put in the time and effort into working on a project of their own design. Students creating their own projects, will motivate them to put their best foot forward. By students designing their project, it becomes a reflection of themselves and their abilities; therefore, they will aspire to present their best work.

There are additional reasons summer projects should be student designed. Students-designed projects are a more accurate assessment of a student's capabilities and knowledge. They test if students can apply what they have been taught without guidance from a teacher or rue brick. This provides teachers with a more accurate gauge to individually assess students. Moreover, these projects would allow students to express their own individuality. Teacher-designed projects confine all students to work within the same parameters, resulting in cookie-cutter projects. Student-designed projects give the freedom to express differing personal interests and modes of creativity.

Although some may disagree, summer projects should be designed by students. Student-designed summer projects are less daunting task to complete, provide students with an outlet to express their individuality, and demonstrate to the teachers what each student is capable of through the application of their preexisting knowledge. Though there are those who argue summer projects should be teacher-designed, this is not true. It would be beneficial to both students and teachers to have student-designed summer projects.
