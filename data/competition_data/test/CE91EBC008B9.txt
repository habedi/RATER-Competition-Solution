Unhealthy texting and driving

Teens and young adults today love texting and being on technology. Technology is a great way to communicate with fellow friends and family. However, there are times where people should put phones down and focus to protect the safety of others. People should not use the phone while driving and on the job while working.

People should always have the phone put up while driving.

It is very dangerous and unsafe to text and drive. When it comes to texting and driving, teens are more likely to be found doing this. Every teen should have the phone away from them and should only use it when they are at a complete stop and parked.

People should not be driving distracted when other passengers lives are in their hands. When others are in the car, it is crucially important for the driver to focus and maintain their driving on the road. Passengers should also make sure they use their seat belt and make sure the driver is focused to ensure their own safety.

Teens are not the only ones texting and driving, young adults are just as worst. Young adults have jobs that call them while they are on the road, which causes a big distraction. Young adults and teens combined are a series of added wrecks and deaths. Deaths due to texting and driving continues to rise. The death toll could easily be lowered if people would just not text and drive.

There would be less deaths and car wrecks from distracted driving.

When it comes to texting and driving, it is a major issue for truck drives. Truck drivers are far worse than teens and adults in their cars. Most drivers wear headsets to communicate while on the road. Headsets are more safe for truck drivers to use instead of having their phone in hand and lose control of the wheel.

When drivers wreck, there are huge consequences. Passengers that are in the vehicle and others involved in the accident have the opportunity to sue or charge the driver. Drivers should always think of the consequences of what will happen if they pick up their phone, lose control, and wreck with people in the car. Drivers should also be off their technology even when they are alone riding safety is number one priority which is why phones should not be used driving.
