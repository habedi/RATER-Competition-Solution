In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming", it has driven me to say that I am all for driverless cars. Using details from the article I can tell you exactly why. I think it is very helpful to people who could use it. Driverless cars would have to create new laws, but then again they would be helpful. Technology is coming far in this world, driverless are only the beginning.

My position on driverless cars are that I'm all for it. I believe that they would come in handy in the future. Even, if they are assisting you , who can't use a little extra assisting? The article says, " The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel." (stated in paragraph 4). Having that there to help you, would be so helpful and useful.

Having a driverless car would be so helpful in many different and wonderful ways. As I mentioned in the last paragraph it's laser beams surroundings of the car. Not only that but, "The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." , also, "They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves."(both stated in paragraph 7). Those are two of the many ways that driverless cars are very helpful.

With new cars come new laws, and with these new laws come safer roads. Some new laws would have to be laws that cover liability in accidenys because who's fault would it really be? In paragraph 9 it states, " If technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?", and they have a good point, but it would automatically be the manufacturer because the driver does not have full control over the car. The article also states, "Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times", which is why they wouldnt know who's fault it would be. Therefore, the laws they crete are only meant to keep people safe.

Coming to a conclusion, I still believe that driverless cars are very helpful to people who could use them. Despite creating new laws, they are very helpful to keeping people safer aswell. The driverless cars are very helpful and wonderful in many and different ways. In my opinion, driverless cars could possibly help the world in ways you wouldn't even think they could. Technology is coming far in this world, Driverless cars would only be the beginning.
