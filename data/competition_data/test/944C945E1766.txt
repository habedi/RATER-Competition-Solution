Dear Principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, I am an eighth grade student, and I support your decision to enforce community service on young students. Community service is a great thing that should be encouraged. It can go from helping a fellow student with a tough assignment to cleaning up after a natural disaster, and can help many life's along the way. It doesn't even have to be hard, if you enjoy knowing you made a difference. It may even teach students a thing or two about life.

It can help teach a teen responsibilities and priorities. It can focus them on wanting to make a change for the better. Even if its just Picking up trash on the ground when outside, it makes that much less pollution and hazards to animal life. Not only that, but it can influence others to help someone in need or just to do what's right morally.

It could even be used as punishment to those who would rather disrupt a class than learn. It is very likely they wouldn't enjoy picking up someone's discarded food off campus, or somewhere else. It may even set a few straight and back, goal oriented. It would also help earn a good reputation for them and their school.

I believe it could help students for the better. Thank you for your time and please consider my words. I am happy I could share my opinion even if it doesn't make a difference.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
