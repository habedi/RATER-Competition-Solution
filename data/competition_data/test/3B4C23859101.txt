The idea of extracurricular activities is very questionable by some schools. There is a big question of whether or not they should be required. I think that extracurricular activities should be required because they help develop time management, improve social skills, and help students know their interests.

Some students in today's world don't know how to manage their time. In my history class most of the kids never get their work done because they don't know how to manage their time. They end up having 15+ assignments late. I know that one of the many things that employers look for in an employee is if they can manage time. If they can't manage their time in history class I don't know how they're going to get a job. Extracurricular activities will help with time management because they will force a student to budget their time on different activities. They will have to choose when to practice or how much time goes towards each assignment.

Extracurricular activities will help with social skills. Students will be forced to communicate with other people. In the real world, employers want an employee that knows how to communicate with coworkers and customers. Extracurricular activities will help the student talk to other people their age and meet new people. It will help some students not be nervous to talk to other people.

Students will discover their interests when they do extracurricular activities. When students are about to graduate high school most of them don't know what they want to do. The main cause of this is they don't know what they enjoy doing out side of school. These students just focus on school work, when really colleges don't only look at the test scores, they also look at extracurricular activities. My grandmother went to college and she graduated with a degree in cartography(map making). She never used that degree for the rest of her life, it was a quick decision that she did not think about. Later in her life she went back to school to become a nurse. She decided she wanted to be a nurse when she really thought about her interests. It is so important for everyone to think about interests. Extracurricular activities can help determine a person's future career.

Extracurricular activities allow students to learn time management, improve their social skills, and learn their interests. These are the important because they are necessary for succeeding in life, in school, and in jobs. Extracurricular activities have overall positive affectsÂ on students.
