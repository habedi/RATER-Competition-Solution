Dear Principal,

I think that students should not have their phones at school at all because not all students will listen to the rules.

One reason I choose policy 2 is because some kids would use them during class and then they would get in trouble.

They would be used to cheat on tests, text friends, and get on the internet.

Many kids would use them to look up answers for papers, tests, homework, or any other projects.

Some might even use them to get on chat rooms or any other website, like facebook and myspace.

Some students would then forget to turn them off, if they were allowed to have them on during free times.

Then they would become a interruption to the educational process.

Teachers would have to stop class and have to tell the student to turn it off or even some teachers would take the phones.

Many kids would have to pick up the phones at the end of the day so they didn't get in trouble again.

More kids would get their phones out after they finish something in class, like homework or a project even if they weren't allowed.

Many students would get in trouble with their phones then without them.

Some students could even use the cameras on their phones to take mean pictures or inappropriate pictures.

There would be more bullying going on with classmates and friends.

Mean stuff could be sent around the school about other kids.

Some kids would even send out rumors causing someone to get hurt.

There would be more causes of kids getting bullied if students were allowed their phones.

Many students would use them so much during lunch that they would get into their conversations with others that they would not eat their lunch.

That would have more students wasting their lunches.

Sometimes there would even be a ton of leftovers that the cooks made and then you would eat the leftovers the next day for lunch.

Students having their phones could cause some major damage to friendships and grades.

That is why I think you should not allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, even if they are turned off during class time.
