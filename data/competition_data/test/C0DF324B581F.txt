Dear, whoever this may concern,

I think that we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and during free time, as long as we turn them off during class time. If we didn't bring phones to school something bad COULD happen. For example we could be walking home and somebody could be following us, phones aren't just for texting or calling our friends, they are also used for emergencies too.

first, we could get kidnapped walking home from school or walking home from the bus stop. Many kids are being taken while walking home or to a friends house. If we had cell phones at school with us then we could maybe call somebody if we are suspicious about the people in our surroundings. If we are just walking home not in a group then, we could get kidnapped.

Second if we aren't sure about our surroundings and we get lost we can call somebody to help us get to where we are going. I know that if I had just moved into a new neighborhood, and i didn't exactly where I was going, I would most likely get lost. If that was to every happen a kid or a teenager who owned a cell phone would be able to call someone for help on where to go. If we got lost we could walk to a street sign and tell the person where we are at if you can get a hold of somebody.

If we want to go somewhere after school instead of going straight home, could cal our parents to ask for permission. Some parents like to call their kids after they get out of school to make sure they are okay. cell phones are a way for a parent to get a hold of their kids. If us kids aren't home around the time we usually are the parents get worried, unless you have called them and told them that you are going to go somewhere after school. Some parents might make their kids bring their phone to school even if they aren't allowed, just to make sure that the kids are safe.

I think we should be allowed to bring cell phones to school because they are used in emergencies, such as getting kidnapped, lost, or just a way for parents to get a hold of their kids. Cell phones are important to parents just as they are to kids too.
