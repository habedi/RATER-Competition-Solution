I feel like extracurricular activities should be a choice. Students shouln't be forced to do one. School activities should be fun and we should do it because we choose to not because the principal feels like we should. We shoudl do it because we feel comfortable with what we chose an if we didnt have an extracurricular before we might've had a good reason. For example alot of people play basketball. They also have reason as to why they play it. Sudents thats play it are most likely playing it because they feel they're in the comfort zone when they play. Students shoudln't have to do extracurricular activities if they dont feel right or comfortable do it. It's obvious that it's unfair especially if they have other things to worry about ousitde of school.

As explained in the first paraghraph, being forced to do something you dont want to do isn't fair and its frustrating. It's different if your mom is telling you to clean up or wash the dishes but if you have to do some that you really dont have to do and the principal is making you because he just wants you too then thats unfair. If your not already involved in an extra activity then apparently you dont want to do. Which is why he should not make you participate. The need to let you keep doing what your doing.

Extracurricular activities can be alot if you have other things to do as well. For example; if you have to stay bad for a certain activity but , you also have to stay back for a certain grade or class and you cant do both then your going to have to chose which one to go to and the grade will seem more important but you still might need to work on something for your extra activity. If you dont stay back for the activity then you'll have more time to get up your grade in this certain class. Instead of worrying about multi-tasking you wont have to. Now if you can make time then that's great and you could include yourself into an extracurricular activity if you need or want extra credit. You could also just do it for fun because thats what it's for!

Another reason for why I disagree with this statement is because of time. Alot of people tryout for certain things and never end up pulling through because of their time and the other things they have to do. Students spend alot of time between sports, chores, and school including homework . Espacially middle school with our extra classes. The majority of students have little siblings that they might need to pick up after school and walk home. Even besides my extra scenarios time is important anyway. It would even be fun if they made us pick an extra activity especially if we didn't want to.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principal and feel like he should not make us chose an extracurricular activity. it wouldn't be fair nor fun and alot of students wouldn't enjoy it. Students barely participate in them anyway and nine times out of ten they have a good reason why . Forcing it doesn't make sense. however thats just my opinion. Other people might think differently.
