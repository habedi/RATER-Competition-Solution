The face on Mars has been said to be created by many things. "Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."(paragraph 5) Other people believe that it is a natural landform. It could have been aliens, but we have yet to find life on Mars. The reason that makes the most sense as to why its there is that it is indeed a natural landform.

Sure the land may look like a face but it is simply a natural landform. It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too. They are common around the American West. These are called buttes or mesas, and buttes are simply "a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa."(paragraph 12)

This landform even reminds people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976. And lastly in 2001, it just looks like a simple mesa, no face, no alien markings.

I do realize that it might make sense to you and other people that it could be made by aliens. But we have yet to find actual life on mars, let alone have it be made by non-existent creatures. This object object may seem extraordinary, but it is simply just a mesa on a planet we haven't even found running water on. I would love to say "Yes, this was actually made by aliens!" but sadly I cannot because it is simply just a landform.

Therefore it could not have been created by aliens because these landforms appear on Earth. It looks similar to landforms on Earth. It also has been photographed many times over the years with better cameras each time. Scientist can gladly say "This is only a landform, in fact these also appear on Earth as mesas or buttes." In conclusion, this is just a natural landform that was not created by other-worldly beings on Mars.
