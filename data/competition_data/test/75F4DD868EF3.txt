I think you should require all students and adults to do community service because its going to help out state and city look more cleaner, and to tell people to do not litter. This is a good idea because you could help older people or help the custodian have the school cleaner. If we have community service we might be the highest state or city that is the cleanest of the fifty states in the year 2011. That would be cool because we could be recognize in the whole world. You could tell people not to be in gangs but in church this would help because we don't have that much people dyeing or killing each other.

Besides helping little kids is really important because your helping them not to litter or to be mean to other little kids. Elementary is the most important place not to litter because little kids just see a candy n the ground and they just pick it up and put it in the mouth. If we see students doing community service the parents might be proud of there child because there helping the community to be more cleaner. If i would do community service i would help people with there yards and if i saw and adult throw a peace of paper i would say kindly can you please pick that up lets try to clean our community please.

In my opinion i would be picking things up than the city or the state would look or smell bad. actually the parents should educate there child since there little and teach them not to litter anywhere. Another thing is that students should do community service during school and after school even if they are not in school.
