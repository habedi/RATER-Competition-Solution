DEAR TEACHER_NAME

I am writing you this letter to tell you that i do agree with your idea of changing the policy. Children don't listen or do there work at school. which means they should not be allowed to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a b average .Many students have a c average which means they don't pay attion to there teachers . When you work hard on your work it pays up but when you don't its just to bad .more then 50% of children flailed 1 semester also 2 so that's pretty much putting you in summer school i mean i would rather be playing outside then sitting at school doing work.

We 8th graders think that 8 grade is as easy as 7 &8 well guess what its not its way harder and i personally i think work is more imported than sports .So instead of going to connections they should have study hall which will make there grades go up so they can play sports.

some people think you can play or be in teams if you were and did not have good grades in middle and high school it will not work like that. You have to have had a' s and b' s or they don't wont you on there teams .

also c' s are not acceptable to play on teams so i love that rule is changed that will make kids work very hard so they can become and play sports
