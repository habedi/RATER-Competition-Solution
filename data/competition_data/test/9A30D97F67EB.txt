"Good morning students, i have a very important news to announce this morning. Im requiring you as students to perform to community service." our principle exclaimed. Having community service is a wonderful thing to have. with community service we can graduate from high school, feel proud about your self , and you can pass it on. This is why i strongly believe that we should have community service.

Uuggghh! i need community service so i can complete my hours for high school , without that i can't graduate. Having community hours for high school is very inportante. Why would you just not go to college just because you haven't completed them. You can do your community service at a hospital, pet shop, helping children , and etc. Has much as you will hate to take your time away from your after school activity or friends , it a great think to do it's not always about yourself you have to think for other and do it with great joy. wouldn't you love to go to college with all you community service and have a great reputation?

"I feel so great and relief , after all this work" STUDENT_NAME mentioned. its a great feeling you feel after doing a great thing for others. Knowing that atleast you helped out an old lady crossing the streets or even helping little children how to walk or talk its a great sensation that you have inside you. everything you do is for experience and feel good about your self no matter how hard work it is. like they say everything you do comes back to you. would you rather but lazy all day , stay home or help other out and feel proud of your self?

Passing on your positive inside you , is a great way to encourage you family and friends.

when you have little brother/sister when you do something good they look up to you and may say "when i grow up i want to be just like you." you don't want to set bad example for other but great ones and make this world a better planet and for us to be able to do what beyond that.

Now to wrap it up , as you read my essay its a great opportunity and experience for us to have community hours. we can graduate from high school , feel proud of our self , and we pass it on to other. "You don't want to see your children set with bad examples but, with great ones that they can learn and become someone in life."
