I agree with Policy 1 because students bring there phones anyways and because if some reason something happens they can always call there parents. Or for example a student gets hurt and a teacher or a nurse cant find there parents phone numbers they can get there phone and look for the numbers. I also agree that they should be turned off during class time because most students text during class or they do impropriate stuff and they can get in trouble. Plus if the cell phones are on during class time they should get in trouble because there's no need for them to be on cause teachers never know if the students are taking picture of them or if there taking impropriate pictures of one an other.

Cell phones being on during lunch and free periods is good because what if a student needs something or they forgot it at home. Or if a teacher says something to them and they don't like it they can call there parents or who ever is in charge of them to come speak to them. Perhaps some parents want them to call them during lunch to see how they are , well some parents. I strongly agree and slightly disagree because some student take advantage of it and don't fallow the rules. I do agree because some may need it in case of an emergency.
