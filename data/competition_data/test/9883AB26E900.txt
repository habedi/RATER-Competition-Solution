Students spend much of their summer still working on homework for a class they aren't even currently in. These summer assignments gets more difficult the higher level the class. Many schools require the students to complete summer assignments to keep their knowledge from the past school year and to begin learning for the next school year. These assignments should be created by the teacher instead of the students, for it will benefit the students more when the teacher creates them.

These summer assignments should be teacher designed, for if students made them, they would make them as easy as they would be allowed to. While students are enrolled in school to learn and gain knowledge, they are also being pushed to receive high grades; therefore, they will try to make their own work as easy as possible to ensure a relatively high grade on the assignment. For example, when students do peer reviews in class, students will usually give each other high grades to make sure that the other students are giving them a high grade as well. It doesn't matter how the others truly did, they just want to have a high grade ensured for themselves, so they will give a high grade to anyone. If a student has a way to without a doubt receive 100% ,they will make sure of it. If the summer assignment was from Geometry going into Algebra 2, they would pick the most basic algebra questions that they could come up with and use what they thought was the easiest unit in geometry to make up the review portion. The students would create a summer assignment that is too easy for someone at their own learning level, making the summer assignment remotely pointless to the students.

Half the information on a summer assignment is review from the year before while half is the new information for the coming school year; therefore, students are unable to create their own summer assignments because they wouldn't even know half the information they are writing about. Writing the review portion of the assignment may be able to help the students go over the material once more; however, they gain nothing out of writing the learning portion. If a student is trying to learn something will trying to create an assignment for others to learn it, they will just end up confusing themselves and not grab any knowledge from the said subject. Students are doing the learning portion of the assignment to learn new material, hence why the teacher create these assignments in a way to make it easy to teach it to the students even when they are on break. Teachers will use the information in the review portion in the learning portion to make the process easier for the students, making it even more beneficial for the students.

Summer assignments are a vital part of a students learning experience. These summer projects help students have an easy transition from one school year, through summer, into the next school year. These assignments make it possible to immediately begin learning at the begin of the school year, for the students already have the background information that they need. If these assignments are made by the teachers instead of the students thye will be beneficial for both the kids trying to learn the subject and the teachers who are trying to teach it.
