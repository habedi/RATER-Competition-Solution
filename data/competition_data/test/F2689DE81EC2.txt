I think that the use of technology to read the emotions of students in a classroom is valuable , because they can read how you feel as in if you are happy Susan can read how happy a person is , she can read if something is discusting to you as an example bugs , they are gross if Lola had seen a bug she would get sick to her stomach. Computers can also read if you are scared or angry If there was a painting hanging on a random wall she could read who made the panting, what brand of colors used, which type of paint brushes invested , she could even find out where the painting was created and or if robert was still alive . It's actuallyamazing how computers can even tell what state or city the painter was from and also about his colleauges he worked with. These computers can construct a 3-D computer model of the face too.
