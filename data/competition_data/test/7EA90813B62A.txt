Dear Princable,

I don't think you should only let kids with a B average participate in sporting events because if the schools kids are averagely get C' s shouldn't you just have it that way.

If you take sporting events away from the kids with C' s on average then you will be taking the sport away fro your school if the B average kids only play. You will be doing that because if the schools students are averagely getting C' s then there wont be that much to make a team with and the teams will keep loosing there will be no more teams if the teams keep loosing. So that's why you should not raise the requirement to a B average or else no teams what so ever.

Also you should not change it because if you put this much stress into kids they will not be able to do assignments. The reason is say you really want to join a spot or activity but its hard to get your grade up so you try to do your work fast to get it done faster to do more if you keep doing that you are sure to not do them well and you will fail even more.

Also the B average students they will be worried to if the mess up and get a lower average they will have to be kicked off the team because they couldn't just fall down to a C average anymore.
