Making Mona lisa simle in mona lisa picture that evryone see she is always smile she never mad or said or depressed. technology people try to make a new software so the computer can show weither you are mad or sad or happy it will tell you that and some ads will pop up and let either you are happy or sad. The computer will tell us what are emotions are and i kind of like that because the computer is leting me know if i'm mad or not or sad or not and if i am ann ad will pop up tell mad or sad .But some people wouldn't like being told their mad or sad some people are different from other people .Like when i look at the mona lisa picture it makes happy it makes me feel good about myself make me wanna look up to her like row model. moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them. But that is good idea to come up with and see how it works .
