Cars are a main aspect in our daily lives, but how would it be if we limited car usage throughout the world? Places would be more environmentally friendly and the streets would be less congested. So why not give it a shot, what could possibly go wrong?

If we limited car usage, it would be easier to get to our destination. Places would be more compact with less space for parking so that stores would be built close enough for us to walk there rather than driving to the nearest mall. Less malls would mean less parking lots, meaning sotres would be built along main streets rather than a highway.

Not only does less cars make it easier to get to the places we need to be, but makes people happier. In the article "In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, a city in Germany, limited car usage making their streets "car-free". Making streets car-free made people way happier, since they are usually tensed when having a car.

Limiting car usage would help the environment. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States? Imagine how polluted it must be in New York where the main streets are congested with cars!

In the article "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, Paris bans driving to clear the air. Congestion was down 60% in France. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France which pollutes the air big time.

Would you rather live in a world full of polluted air and congested streets rather than walking or biking to places way closer and saving the earth at the same time? You decide.       Â
