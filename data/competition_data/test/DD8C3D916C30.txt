The face is just a natural landfrom because in space there is a lot of astroids. Astroids could of hit the planet many times and have made a shape that looks like a human face. Aliens couldn't of made it because it's two miles wide from end to end at it would take alot of time. Scientists at NASA figureed out it was another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only that had an unusual shadow.

Conspiracy theorists belive that NASA is just trying to hide aliens on mars. Many people wanted to see the picture of the face formation, but later reaveling that it was just a natural landform. Scientists said that it wasn't easy for them to get another look at the face beacuse the MGS only scans in 2.5 km strips and they don't past over it often. Later NASA took another picture and the MGS took a photo using the cameras best resolution.
