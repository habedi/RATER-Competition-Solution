Some people believe that learning from home can tempt students to do other activities instead of studying; However, attending classes from home can be beneficial to students because it can help them stay to focus on the lesson without getting distracted and they will not get into any types of trouble at all.

Students would be able to focus on the lesson without getting distracted. For example, chatting with friends during class hours. This shows that they can be a distraction because students are not able to finish their work on time and ends up failing the class. In another example, the volume level of the class. This proves that students would not be able to concentrate better and would have a hard time understanding the lesson because the volume level is too high and it tends to distract a lot of students. Therefore, attending classes from home can help students to avoid these type of situations at school.

Students would not get into any types of trouble at all. For example, fights. This shows that a lot of students tend to get into a lot of fights with their classmates because of a personal matter. Also, skipping classes. This proves that a lot of teenagers tend to lie to their parents and are trying to rebel. Therefore, students would not experience these types of trouble anymore because their parents can monitor their behavior at home.

Although people may think that distance learning takes away the privilege of students socializing with different people, distance learning is still better because it can help students to be independent by studying by themselves and it teaches them to be more serious about their grades.

As a result, attending classes from home can benefit students because it helps students to focus on their work or task without getting distracted by anyone and it helps them to maintain a better mark.
