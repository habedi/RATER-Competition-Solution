The Author support his Idea of Exploring Venus the author has many valid points that could be highly usable. I believe that the author uses The idea of Scientist disscussing further vists to Venus, NASA compelling idea of sending humans to Venus, and NASA's other approaches to studying Venus.

The Idea of Scientist disscussing further visits to Venus supports the author's reasoning because Most Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it is the most earth like planet. Many Years ago Venus was guessed to of had been covered in many oceans and various supported forms of like, just like what earth has. Venus still has features that are the same as Earth. The Planet has a rocky surface with valleys and mountains, This makes us think that Venus was once a planet just like Earth.

NASA's compelling ideas about sending Humans into space to study venus are intreging and make it possible for people to be able to touch the surface. NASA's Solution to the Hostile Conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientist to stand out. NASA's ideas of making blimp like vehicles that hover 30 or more miles over the surface bring up the idea of being able to be closer to the surface and would be safe and away from the unplessently warm ground. Sitting at 30 miles above the surface would allow people to still live at 170 degrees fahrenheit but at the pressure level of being in the sea.

NASA's Research for working on many other aproaches to studying Venus Up close have been to make Electronics made with silicon carbide and lasted three weeks under the conditions of Venus Simulated. Another project that NASA is looking back on is the old technology of mechanical computers. The Thought of one of these mechanical computers existing in 1940 was impossible but these were not really computers but just like a lever system.

I believe that The Author supported his ideas with NASA's Many Various approaches to studying Venus, Sending Humans to study Venus Physically, and Scientist's Facination of Venus Because How many years ago it was just like Earth. I think that all of these are used to convey the authors idea and support how his idea works. The Heat that is emmited from Venus's surface is inhabitable and impossible to live in but yet people still are trying to find their way around this formidable opponet on their way of the Exploration of Venus.
