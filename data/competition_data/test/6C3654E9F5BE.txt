Making a claim against reading students emotions. In my opinion could be a bad idea. That might be taking technology a little too far. They caculated what the painter painted Mona Lisa feelings would've have been. Thats insane and just a little too far. If they can read a paintings expressions from several years ago. I wouldn't want them reading a humans facial expression. Thats my thoughts on that.

It says they can caculate humans expression like math hoemwork in paragraph 2. It begins with a computer that constructs 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 muscles of the human face must move like human muscles. Each humans facial expression is universal according to the statement in paragraph 4. It's pretty amazing to think about then again it's kind've scary humans can do that reading. I perform the same expressions every day well every one does it isn't just me. It isn't very valuable in my opinion either because maybe if their emotional problems are different then they need to be what are they going to do about it. It will just read his facial expressions won't change anything. That would also cost a lot of money to have in each certain classrooms and also a bunch of money to make the 3-D computer.

In paragraph 6 it says if your frowning and a ad pops up it can read that and if you smile a certain ad would pop up. Just crazy to think about. It says in paragrpah 7 your home Pc couldn't handle reading that of course and they are expensive enough. So that would be much more costly even.
