Do you think students should have to participate in school activities ? I agree all students should participate in school activities.

I think it could help our future, Give us exprenice,and make the school better.

I think it would help us with our future. Because school activities could show you something that your interested in that you never you would be interested in. And school activities could help you out with college. school actives could help you in life. And it could help us be successful.

School actives could give you exprenice in life that you could use when your older. like cosmetology or nursing,cullinary and etc. like you could help somebody in real life emergency's. So when you older you would know what to do because of the school activity. That you did back in high school or middle school.

School activities can make a school a better place. Because some schools dont have school actives like how some other school do. And it gives something to do that you are interested in during the day.

Instead of doing something your not interested in. And could have more new student from different places to go to a different school to give them something to do that are interested in during school.

What are your three reasons on why schools should or shouldn't have to participate in school actives? School actives could help us be successful. give you exprenice in real life situations. and can make your school a better place. And could make the school more better.
