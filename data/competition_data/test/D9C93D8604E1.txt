Dear TEACHER_NAME ,

I think that policy number 2 is a good policy because if you allow students to bring cell phones to school then they will not only use them in lunch or passing periods i think they will be using them in the classrooms too. I think that if you allow them to bring cell phones to school then they would start using them in class too and then they wont be able to learn anything if you allow them to bring them. Also, i think they would be using them all around the school and they don't turn them off they just put them on vibrate or they silent mode them. I think it would be good if they bring cell phones but then they might get too excited then they're going to start using them every time, but i also think some should bring them because sometimes they need to call they're parents after school but sometimes they could get out of hand. They can also be prank call people or they can cyber bully someone and i know that, that wont be good for our school. They wont be learning anything if you allow them to bring cell phones because maybe when they are taking test they text each other the answers or tell each other to help. I mean bringing cell phones isn't bad but what would the consequences be if you let them bring they're cell phones? Well i think some of the consequences can be they can get lower grades, they can cheat, they can be using them in class or even cyber bully someone! I don't think they should because they will be using them all around the school and that will be a bad thing.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME :)
