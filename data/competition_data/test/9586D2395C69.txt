Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Lots of parents buy their own kids cell phones to make them responsible for their own actions.

In my opinion cell phones should be allowed at school and use them only during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they have them off during class. Having cell phones at school is an important idea, because you have to think about the kids at school they need a phone for emergencies ,someone never knows if something will happen. Things happen for a reason. Another reason is that some students may forget their proper school tools and have to tell their parents that they need to bring them. Kids ask for permission for an example, they may need to call or text to tell them that they are going to stay after school for an exam or a makeup test. Some students don't feel good and they want to ask their parents to come, and pick them up.

Parents are caring for their child and think cell phones are the only way to keep them in contact, because if something happens to them they can call the police or mom and dad. Remember that adults are not the only ones who need cell phones, but kids too. This is why cell phones should be permitted on school campus.
