A new piece of technology, the Facial Action Coding System, has been developed and is helping with the learning the emotions of others. Some may say that this technology should not be used in classrooms because it invades the students' privacy. However, finding the emotions of students in classrooms could help teachers with what kind of lessons to prepare and finding out potemial problems that students had. The ability to read the emotions of students in classrooms could be extremely valuable.

Some may argue that having the emotions of students read in class would be a bad idea. If the school could find out what their students were feeling with a computer program, the students may be unhappy with the idea that their school was observing their feeling. In paragraph 8 of the article, the author states, "faces don't lie". If teachers used this technology, they could know the emotions of students even if students tried to hide it. In this way, students could feel as though the school is invading their privacy by finding out emotions that they want to keep hidden. Their emotions can be tied to their thoughts. In most cases, people consider their no one else should be able to know their thoughts and emotions without the person's consent. Some argue that reading the emotions of others will be an invasion of privacy.

Teachers using the knowledge of students' emotions could be helpful in a classroom. If teachers know how students are reacting to different assignments, they could alter the worksheets to make the students more interested and understand what they are learning better. Also, if a computer can understand the emotions of children that are using it, the computer can change the material to aid in the learning. The article states, "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" and "it could modify the lesson". Teachers being able to help students better understand what they are being taught is just one of many benefits to using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms.

The knowledge of students' emotions could be beneficial to schools. If teachers could figure out the emotions of students, they teachers could potentially find and help students that are suffering with problems. The author states, "faces don't lie". Knowing what is truely going on with students by using this program could help the teacher recognize if a student is struggling with anxiety or stress. Students with anxiety and stress could potentially have suicidal thoughts or actions. By identifying this problem, teachers could get help for the student and help prevent the death of an innocent life. The article also states, " moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them". The teachers could additionally do exercises with students to reduce their stress levels. The technologies like the Facial Action Coding System could help teachers know about students' anxiety and prevent harm to the students.

Though some say there could be several issues with using technology to read emotions in classrooms, there are many more benefits than issues. The system could modify the learning style to one that suits the individual student and could help teachers learn of problems the student has. Using technologies like the Facial Action Coding System to help read students' emotions could be an important asset for schools.
