Sir can I interest you with this flyer about the Seagoing cowboys program. No I' fine but thank you said the man. But sir you don't even know what the progarm is about. Well then tell me replied the man. It's a great and exsiting adventure were you go on a boat acrost the Atlantic or the Pacifac and help the contrys in ruin by bringing animals and food for the animals.

Well but don't you think that I could do more by just donating money asked the man. When you donate money it gets spit up and a small percentege of the money goes to each indevidual contry in need. However with this program you can help a country very effectivly by bringing hundreds of animals overseas at a time. But that sounds like much more work than just donating money. If you join the seagoing cowboys you will get to see many exsiting things and you will be helping more than you could if you just donated money.

Well I do have alot of spare time on my hands since I got fired from my job and nothing else to do said the man. Well then you can join the program and help the countrys in need. You know what I will take a flyer. I garentee you will not be disaponted. Thank you said the man.
