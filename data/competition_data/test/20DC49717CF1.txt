Wow, wouldn't you think that exlporing the sea, going to volcanoes, and jumping out of planes would be fun? Well being a NASA scientist can be as fun. Don't you think it would be very intersting seeing what is in space? Im here to tell you that the Face is a natural landform.

I have several claims to support my argument that the Face is a natural landform. Many people believed that the Face was created by aliens, but have they seen the aliens? How would they know that the aliens did it if they didn't see them do it? What if it's just a illusion and peole think it's a face? They dont have enough proof.

There are many evidence that I've found that my staements are true. In the article it states that " Thousands of anxious web sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavealing.... a natural landform. There was no aliens monument after all." It also states that " the camrea on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze." If they didn't know for sure why would they think aliens did it?

That's why the Face is just a natural landform. There are no such thing as aliens. The Face is just something created by nature and nothing elese. People need to start think about what they say.
