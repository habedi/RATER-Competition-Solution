Dear Principal,

I think the whole school should have to perform at least one community service act every week. Such as helping out at the basketball games, cleaning up the mess afterwards. Also, we could go around the whole school and pick up the trash, during or after school, this would make the school a better place to be. We could pick up after are selves instead of just leaving our trash/other objects everywhere. Every other week we could go read to elementary schools, or go help them with math. We could show sixth graders around are school so they no where to go, and no what classes to go in, and what time they need to go in these classes, this would keep them from wasting time being confused, and walking around the courtyard lost. Also we could plant flowers or trees in the courtyard and make it look prettier. When people chew gum in the classroom make them put in the trash, don't let them stick it up under the desks, or throw it on the floor for someone else to step on. Let the students come in teacher classrooms and pick up scrap paper and let us put it in the recycle bin to help our environment. We could reuse pencils in till they are all the way to the eraser. We could do a free car wash, and let people get there car washed for free. We could go to nursing homes, and bring them apples and muffins. If every student in the school does at least one of these, we should go to the beach; and help pick up the trash there too, and help out other communities and be a fun field trip.

Sincerely,
