Exploring Venus is one of are closest or second planet form our sun and one of the brightest one in the solar system Nasa had a compelling idea as doin research on the plant called Venus now considering Venus being so close to our sun the maybe had issues about three decades ago by traveling around a couple kilometers.

We had a thick atomosphere of 97 persent our solar system getting that close to a planet like Venus or mercury they way and how close to the sun they may of been would be extream hot heat that would be coming of form the sun the it could burn now i don't no of we hot/heat proof suits or what not but it sure is a crazy thing but intstead of not completeing that then Nasa would need tooi send drones that would be buid for temps like that and in those certain situations.

Now scientists are even going futher of the grid as move it too the next level of being able too visit sister planets and what not to make them liveable in time for when it has to come to certain situations like our planet starting over as taking us to a new one but the conditions of plantes always have a crucial consideration of giveing long frames in space travel the and the vaule of returning but there has been both of having more and more scientifically speaking as which the fahrenheit around 170 degrees that would be very toasty for sum of us if we landed on the platet in those tempatures to become of those standards.
