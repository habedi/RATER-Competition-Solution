Yes studying venus is a worthy pursuit because you never know what we might find just like the author said their could be another form of life. Studying venus might be a very dangerous act but i mean look at who we have as our president. Just walikng down the street is dangerous in some parts. I think it could be a very interesting study.

The author said that venus has very high conditions but i mean scientists have found a way to live on mars so i mean cant we do that too. Yes it could be very hot and dangerous but what if we found the creators of life not saying we would ut you never know. I just think it is a good idea t study venus. Everyone has questions about how we got here what made life or even who made life but not one person can answer that because we dont know but if we study venus imagine what we could find.

Yes this might be a very dangerous act but it could also be a very useful act too. I think studying venus it a great ideo and i hope people agree. So yes we should study venus and try to find a way over the hurdles of venus and figure some things out.
