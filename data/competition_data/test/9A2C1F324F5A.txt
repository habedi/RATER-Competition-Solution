Dear Principle,

I think the community service is a great idea, I definitely agree that kids should be helping change our future, for we are going to be the ones living in it. I think the choice of making us do community service will help our community, let us understand what's really important, and also teaches us other valuable lessons.

No matter what kind of service we are doing, helping kids with there education, picking up litter, etc. It will later all help us in one way. Although just helping others is a good reason for service, we must also think about what is best for us and our future. Helping younger kids get a better education is one that will also help our future later on. The more kids who are getting a better education, the more kids we have getting better grades, going to collage, becoming doctors, fire fighters, scientist, one's that may even save us or the world one day. Even picking up garbage changes the world, just one person picking up trash could save a country from water pollution. Whatever were doing we know its for a good cause, because we're not just helping others, we are helping our self's too, by changing the future for the good.

Although not many kids appreciate taking time from what they like to do for service, making it an acquired thing will point us in the direction of understanding to choose what's really important. We must be reminded of what's better for us at times, and sometimes we need a little push even though we want to stay in the same place. Many kids focus on their favorite activities to do now, video games, television, computer games, but the truth is none of these skills are going to help us in the future, and if we want to have a better future, we need to focus on what's going to make it better. Becoming a couch potato who doesn't have a job, or a doctor saving the lives of people everyday? Just one wake up call to students like us could brighten are future and help us make other smart choices of what's better.

Even though service is more important, kids will also want to have free time to do what they wish. Making us do community work not only shows us what's right, but teaches us other lessons to. In this case using our time wisely, if we use are time appropriately, helping out the community and doing what's expected we will have time to do what we want too. So there is no real excuse for not being able to do what you want unless you didn't use your time wisely. Community service doesn't have to be so bad. I think if we spent an a appropriate time doing service work and also be given free time too, it could let us live regularly and also let us help our future too.

Sincerely,

A student
