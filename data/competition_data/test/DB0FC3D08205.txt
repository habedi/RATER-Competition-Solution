Limiting car usage is advantage. Many my think its not a advantage because its an easy way to get around. It may be the easiest way to get around but take the time out to think about the bad it cause. You wont be able to live some places because the wont have enough parking spaces. Where are you going to park? The diesel fuel you use to keep the car going pollute the air. Then we would have alot of bad air floatring around. Its also a problem to the traffic. Why not carpool, ride a bus, train, or bike? there are many different transportations in the world why just use one all the time?

You see, cars may be the easiest way to get around but let's study some of the bad. One reason limiting cars is an advantage is because if you don't have a car 9 times out of 10 it would be easier for you to stay anywhere. Some homing areas doesn't have enough land to make an parking lot. So if you see somewhere you would like to live without an parking lot who would probably have to find somewhere esle to live. You can slove that by just getting rid of your car. I understand that getting rid of your car would probably be the hardest thing you have ever done but look at the bright side. You would be living in the place you want to be living in.

Not only would it be easy to find somewhere to stay but also you wont have to worry about polluting the air with diesel fuel. Its crazy how you spend 3 dollars for an gallon of gas just to pollute the air. You would be better off just spending 3 dollars to catch an city bus or train. Yes they also pollute the air but if you ask me not as bad as cars. I say that that because if you think about it you see more cars than any city bus or train. why not just catch an bus or train to help our in en
