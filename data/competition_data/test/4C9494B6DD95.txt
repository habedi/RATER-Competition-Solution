Dear principal,

I have heard around the school and online about how you plan to make a new policy that does not allow students to participate in sports unless they have a grade B average. I along with many other students here at our proud school do not agree with this new policy. I have been asked by several students to write a letter to you stating that we do not want this new policy to become official and the reasons why.

One of the main reasons that have been told to me by the student body is that some of the best players on our teams are C average students. Without them our winning game levels will surely go down by a great amount. Even strait A students around the school want us to remain the leading champions in our district by having the other students remain on our team. School spirit is important to the students of our school in which we take pride .

One reason that effects me personally is that one of my closest friends has a C average. I have tried helping her in the past but because of personal issues at home she is not able to concentrate in class. The things she is going through make life itself hard on her. She has told me in the past that baseball is her only outlet to release all of her worries and anger. She is also one of the leading track stars at our school as well. To take her off of the team would for sure crush all of her hopes and dreams she has left.

She is not the only student at our school who is having personal family issues at home as you probably know. Many students around our school use sports to escape from their troubles. They enjoy it and it gives them something to look forward to at the end of the day.

Exercise is an important part of the deal too. Denying a child school sports is like denying them physical education. As an entire student body. A, B,C and below average students all need exercise and all go to physical education class. Some because it is required and some because they love getting exercise and makes school fun for them. To conclude my letter; what I am basically trying to say is that C average students should be able to play and compete with the rest of us because they are needed not only for the B and A average students but their en school too.
