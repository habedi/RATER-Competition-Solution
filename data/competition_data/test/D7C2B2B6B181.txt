The Electoral college process consists of the selections of our electors. The electors get together and vote for presidents, and vice presidents. I think that the poeple of the united states should have all the power with voting. We should be able to vote for the electors. This would get rid of all the people that ruin our country or are corrupt. The voting system should have 2 finalists for each branch of the gorverment. They should add up all the vote and see who has the most. they're should not be two parties. I feel like this would make the voting more equal and fair. The candidate's running for president should not have they're own group of electors. They should speak the truth on how they will help this counrty out, and should trust that the people make the right vote.

The electoral college is looked at as a non-democratic way of selecting the president . When you vote, you're not voting for the presdient, you're voting for electors that will choose who is president. This means the people don't really have a say in the electoral college voting system

In my opinion, i think people should have all the power in voting, this would make the process alot smoother. The people would elect who they feel would do best for this counrty. This would also create new community groups and councils for voting. People would open up voting centers and meetings. It would employ more jobs and build a stronger relationship. Most inportenlty, a good president
