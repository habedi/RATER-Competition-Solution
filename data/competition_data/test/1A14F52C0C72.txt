Imagine having to go home from school to have to do your homework, and then picking up your sibling from elementary school, then making dinner for them all while your both your parents are working.

You go to bed at 11 every night to wake up at 6 to go to school.

Now your principal is requiring one extracurricular activity for each student. How are you going to fit that into your already busy schedule?

I don't think that the principal should require students to participate in one extracurricular activity.

I think this because some students do not have the time to add another activity into the day, school should not control your personal life, and although some students might be doing the bare minimum, that doesn't mean other students aren't trying hard in school.

To start off, students should not be required to have one extracurricular activity because some students do not have the time to add another extracurricular activity into their day.

Although some activities might be in school, they add on more work and stress to the student.

Some students struggle to complete homework by their bedtime everyday.

Some students do not even finish their homework until around one in the morning.

Those students also have to wake up around 6 to go back to school.

That comes out to about 6 hours of sleep when they should be getting 8 or 9 hours of sleep.

The situation for every student is different.

For example, a student might have to take care of a younger sibling and tend to the house while both the parents work. Do you think that this is fair?

Reason number two for the principal not requiring a extracurricular activity for each student.

School should not be able to control your personal life along with your school life.

There is a border between your personal and school life.

Time is a precious thing.

If one extracurricular activity equals around 1-2 hours, then that will mean you will finish you homework two hours later, and that means you will have less free time to hang out and relax.

So, instead of going to that movie or dinner with your friends, you have to do homework and study.

School already takes up 6+ hours of your day, how much longer can they make it?

My final reason that students should not have to add an extracurricular activity to their day is that some students are already working hard for their age and some students are not privileged like other students.

Their families might be struggling to make ends meet every day and they might have to work a job just so their siblings can eat dinner.

They are already hardworking and shouldn't have to work more just because the principal wants to require this.

Adding this activity will just add more stress to the student.

The school is not aware of everyone's situation. I do not think that these hardworking students deserve this.

In conclusion, the principal should not require an extracurricular activity because some students are too busy to add another activity into the day, your personal life is separate from your school life, and the principal should not be able to add more work on to the stressed, hardworking students.

Doing something like this would not be fair.
