Dear Principal,

We do not want the grades to be a B average to play sports or other activities because the activities we get we could really be good at it and be inspired to do big things. However if you let us have sports and activities i know that we will probably do better in classes. Students would love to keep there activities to get a break from hard working in class and just have fun for a change. If the students improve while having sports and activities then taking them away unless you have

B average Will make Kids Sad and not participate in class and kids will become furious and the reason i wrote this letter is to protect the sports and activities we get you'll never know our activities like Creative Writing can help students reach there goal in life so don't ruin it and take it away. In Many ways sports help us become superstars people Become superstars by keep doing what there good at like football The movie "The Blind Side" was about a homeless boy named Michael He liked football he was later adopted by A lady who cared for him he was is one of the best line men today. He even stopped a airbag from killing his little brother when they were driving he ended up going to Michigan State University and Later Became a line men for the Baltimore Ravens . So I'm asking you Principal please don't take away sports and etc.

Because in order to succeed in life you have to focus on your goal.

Sincerely, your Students
