How would you feel if the computer you were using at this moment could read your emotions and use the feedback from it to change what you was learning. Thats what Proffesor Huang at the Beckham Institue of Advanced Science is doing.

I think using the compiuter program would be a great way to learn. Imagine thinking that the lesson you are learning was boring, and then the lesson changes itself to fit your style of lesrning. Itd be a new revolution in the way we learn. IT could make the experience of learning fun and more intrigueing.

The student could be more attentive and enjoy learning. Proffesor Huang introduced this idea to make learing more interesting for students. HE also used the program to take the place of a human instructor.

So next time youre bored or upset at the lesson youre learning think about the future and about how in a few years you might be learning in a new manner on the computer
