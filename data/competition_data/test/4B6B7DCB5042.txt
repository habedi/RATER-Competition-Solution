Imagine one day your on your way to work and suddenly theres a crash right in front of you, the first thing you try and do is avoid being apart of the wreck.

If your in your "Driverless car" you cant do anything to avoid the wreck because the car cant respond as fast as a human being. Also what if the car sensors mess up and you cant do anythog about it your pretty much done for.

If people are getting to lazy to drive their own cars I think we will have bigger problems then just trying to develop a driverless car. Also imagine the cost of a driverless car. Half of Americans are in debt right now. How is someone going to be able to afford a driverless car. Imagine the amount of money being put in to the research for developing these driverless cars. Also what are you suppose to do if your driving down the road and see a resturant that you want to stop at how are you suppose to tell the car to immediately go there.

Also of your going on a road trip there's no way your goung to make it all the way to florida without having to assist the "driverless car". It is almost to difficult to develop a driverless car that is comepletly driverless.
