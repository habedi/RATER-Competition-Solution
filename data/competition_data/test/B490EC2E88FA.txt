Dear Principal,

I don't think all students should be required to do community service. I think this because then they won't be doing it by choice and might find it annoying or not fun and be mean to people while doing it. I think this because if they don't want to do it in the first place then why would they want to do it because they have to? If they wanted to in the first place they would have chosen something to do, and would have done it. If they don't have enough free time or their parents wouldn't let them, then that would be a good idea, but not everybody will like the idea of having to perform community service. That is why I think community service should not be required, but have it as an after school activity instead. That way the students that want to do it but can't, can do it after school, and it will be a choice to continue or stop. That's better then having it required, isn't it? It could also be extra credit points to do community service to. Then student with bad grades that want to do better will also do community service to help their grades, meaning more students will be performing community service.
