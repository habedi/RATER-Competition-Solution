Dear principal,

What you are doing is a great idea. But some students it may not be possible for them to do community service. For instance some students are in athletics. This will take up a big portion of their time and energy. Not to mention they still have to do their homework.

Another problem may be that they have to take care of a sibling while their parents work. This may not be a problem for some, kids can go to day care. But others don't have the money to put young kids in a day care. So you would be taking away from the family in the process of helping the community. If money gets tight they may have to resort in getting a job. This will take up a big chunk of their free time and put more stress on the student.

It may be in your best interest to keep community service optional. If you do add it as a requirement student's grades will drop and students will have a difficult time paying attention in class. The reason is they will be worn out from staying up late finishing homework after their sports or jobs, and their community service. I advise you consider these situations when you make the final decision.

Sincerely, 8th grade student
