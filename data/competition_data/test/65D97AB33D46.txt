A principal of a school has decided that that the whole school had to participate in one school related activity, a lot of us students strongly agreed about this new idea the principal came up with, but the few students that were against it did not really liked the idea of having activities. not because they don't like it, because they don't know the real benefits of having an school related activities.

On behalf of the majority of the school whom approved the fact we should have school related activities, I agree. It is good to have a school that everyone wants to be in something they enjoy, not something that is forceful. Thats why it is best that we should and have the will power to engage in school related activities.

If we are the students of the school we are basically the foundation of the school, it basically means that the school rely on us, so that we can rely on them. It is said a student is better lived when he or she enjoys something they do and not forcefully done by someone else. it would also help fund the school like for example, if you were in a activity where you are doing the schools yearbook pictures, you are selling those pictures or books afterwards, it strongly help fund the school.

iIt is best concluded that activities help instead of hurt the environment of the school it is also concluded that it helps the life of the students so that they can live in a place that they would want to be in not in a place they would not like to be in.
