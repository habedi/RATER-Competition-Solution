Dear Principal,

Some students prefer to participate in community service whilst others believe that it is a waste of time. I believe giving back to the community is a great way for students to show their care and love for the town they live in. I also believe that students should be required to perform community service. Community service is a great way for students to give back to their city or town they lived in since they were young, it teaches students lessons that can be later on in life, and it can provide students with a great, fun opportunity to meet new friends and make our world a better place. Community service is a great way for students to learn positive values and teach them new lessons. The real question is why wouldn't students want to participate in a community service project?

Community service is a great way for students to give back to the town that had supported them for their lives. Whether it is sweeping trash off of the streets, cleaning up a local garden, or visiting with people in a retirement home or hospital, community service is a great way to show that students care. Although these tasks are laborious, most students do not realize how beneficial it can be to make their town a better place. Most people greatly appreciate work that has been done to help the community and sometimes reward those who did their share. There is nothing like the feeling of satisfaction after finishing a good deed. It doesn't just make the person themselves feel good, but it also makes the whole community feel good!

Community service also teaches students very important life lessons. When performing service in a soup kitchen, students learn the value of life and begin to understand that there are people whom are less fortunate than themselves. This kind of community service teaches children to appreciate the things they have in life and teaches students to be less selfish. It also shows that it is important to help those is need, to reach out a helping hand, and send a positive message. Community service also teaches students discipline and teamwork, two things that are required in adult life. Some students do not understand how to work well with others or trust other students. When performing community service, these lessons are learned and students can become better prepared for their adult careers. Not only does community service make the world a better place, it teaches students and participants to a be a better person themselves.

Another reason why community service should be required for students is the fact that it is a fun opportunity for students to do their part to help the community. Most service projects are worked on in groups of people. When working with others, not only does it build teamwork skills but also gives students the chance to make new friends. Some students may not have that many friends, but after participating in a service project, new friends are bound to be made. Most students also believe that community service is a hard, laborious task when in reality it is a fun, active way to spend your afternoon or weekend. Most service projects are placed in fun, active environments where working isn't considered working at all! Community service is a great way to show students that working doesn't always have to be boring and hard.

As you can see, community service should be completed by all students. Students will learn that community service isn't just a hard, boring task to be completed but a fun way to give back to the community. Community service is a great way for students to give back to their town or city, learn important life lessons, and have fun while doing their part to help the community. Many students believe that students community service is a waste of time but I believe otherwise. These are my reasons why I believe that students should be required to perform community service.

Sincerely,

Student
