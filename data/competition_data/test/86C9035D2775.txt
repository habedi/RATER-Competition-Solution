Exploring Venus

The author supports the idea about study the planet Venus because this article talks about that Venus is a planet that was like the Earth ithasa surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. But Venus has the hottest surface temperature of our solar system even if Mercury is closer to our sun. The National Aeronaustics and Space Administration (NASA) is thinking about to send humans to Venus, many researchers are working on innovation that would allow our machines to have knowledge of Venus. Venus is the closest in distance and neighbor of the Earth and Mars even that, the pressure is 90 times greater than the any preassure of the Earth and that Venus's temperature is around of the 170 degrees but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth.

In conclusion, scientist are trying to innovate the technology to support the conditions that Venus has, and study more of it, like what kinds of thinks human can find in the planet, or some resources that we don't have, the curiosity of human should not stop by the danger that is outside of our knowledge.
