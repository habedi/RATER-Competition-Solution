Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens?

How can you believe that the face on Mars was aliens? it is obviously just another landform of Mars'. Here, i'll go through some evidence that it is just a landform.

First of all, landforms like that are common in Cydonia. Also, keep in mind that appearances can be decieving. You can even see a similar landform right by the "face". And plus, there is no scientific evidence of life on another planet, let alone Mars. Simply stating that a haze could've hid the "alien" markings is hardly a compelling argument.

Second off, The photo they took in 2001 proves even further that it just a normal martian messa. and accourding to the article that have read, "you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size." if you want to check this article out, you can find that information in paragraph 11. so if there were any alien objects, you could both see what they were and even know what they were.

I think i have proven my point. so don't even try to argue that, you will not succeed. i know that you might say, well NASA is just lying. My response is that if you had the money to afford a satellite and you sent there, with the current high grade cameras, you would find that you were wrong all along. so yes I win this argument, and that the "face" on Mars is just a messa.
