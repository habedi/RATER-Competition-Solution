New technologies are created everyday. A new technology that was recently created is one that is called the Facial Action Coding System. This system enables computers to identify human emotions. This system itself can be very valuable to read the expressions of students in a classroom.

This resource can be very useful to teachers as well as students. This system will be essential to teachers when it comes to online assignments or practice games. As stated in the article " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," " Then it could motify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." That would then make the teachers job easier because if they are bored or aren't understanding the topic the system will read that and change up the lesson a bit. The students will also benefit from this because it makes learning fun and easier to understand. The easier it is to comprehend something the better a student will do in school.

The Facial Action Coding System would be a great asset to the student classroom. It makes school run smoother and easier for the staff and students. This new technology will help not only the education department but many others as well.
