"well not all people like to do other things." Joining a different activity is not what a lot of people like to do very much. Kids dont really talking in front of a lot of people because they could be shy or anything. When kids do a extracurricular activity they could agree with people and disagree with people because everyone don't have the same opinion. So I disagree because some could get hurt doing sports , they go visit family and they don't have time to do anything and people is not an out door person and don't talk that much.

Kids could get hurt doing sports , like I was younger at my dad football practice and a boy pop his bond out of place so they call the ER and he had to get things done. Most kids hurt they self though out the year when they're doing sports because they could of been doing things wrong so they hurt themselves. Most people don't like going outside and doing that much activity or like playing sports. A lot of kids like to be healthy if they going to play a sports or anything and they keep their body in shape. Students shouldnt have have participate in a activity if they dont want to and i dont thing they should get force too if they dont want to do it at all.

Most kids don't often go and visit they family so some kids go on trips and visit they family if they don't see them and things. It's good that kids go see they're family, also and kids are shy, they don't talk to people or they're not an outdoor person so they stay in the house and don't talk to no one. It would take up kids time if they want to go visit they family so I think kids should go visit they family if they don't see them that often and if they want to spend time with them. Most people worry about they family so they don't have time to go visit their family that much. Like my family that live far but not that far away from me i would go visit them and still be in things.

Even tho kids are not an outdoor person or dont talk to that much people it they still dont have to do something they dont want to. Kids dont like staying after school for sports or anything only if its something fun and your helping out thats what kids like to do. Doing something could help but students shouldn't have to just do it if they dont want to and its theyre choice if they want to do it or not they dont have to get force to. A lot of kids just dont talk or nothing and they don't do nothing but talk to they friend or stay in the house and not do nothing. Most kids dont even have that much friends they could do or nothing so most kids dont do after school activitys.

Kids just don't go outside or don't do something because they could get hurt or anything. Most kids love doing an activity with their school and then other kids just dont like doing something at all. So I disagree because kids shouldnt have to do something they dont want to do if its in school or out of school. They also dont have to be/get force to do anything. A lot of other kids are like teachers pet and do a lot for teachers and even help out with a lot of teacher with a lot of things . Kids are shy to even do extracurricular activity like help with year books , do sports or anything, most kids dont even see their family like they'er opposite to so kids dont do other activity or sports like that.
