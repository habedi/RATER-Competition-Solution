Dear, TEACHER_NAME,

I hear that you want students to have at least a B average to participate in athletic or any other after school activity. i really think you should reconsider this policy. Many students aren't really that smart and the don't get the things that they are learning, and having a B average is very hard to get for them. imp not saying they are stupid, I'm just saying there as good in some of there subjects. they really would like to play sports but cant keep or maintain a B average in school. it is very unfair to the kids who aren't as book smart as others. which is why i would like you to reconsider this policy. it may sound reasonable, but to us students we think it is extremely unfair.

to tell students that they must have a B average to play sports just isn't right. i think that many kids cannot make that average. maybe for the really smart kids, but not for the students that struggle in there classes. i guess that kids should get good grades, but i think a c average is good enough for them to play sports and other after school activities. so, TEACHER_NAME, please reconsider what you are doing and make it a little bit easier on your students. please and thank you!

sincerely, your student,

STUDENT_NAME
