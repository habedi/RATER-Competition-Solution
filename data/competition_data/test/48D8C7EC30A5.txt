Studying Venus is a worth pursuit because it can help us in the long run if something happens to earth. In paragraph 4 it states that "furthermore, recall that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary vist." Also Venus and Earth are the same in many ways. For example, in paragraph 2 it says "Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance to." These were some reasons why Venus it worth to pursuit.

The reason that Venus should be studyed is in case that Earth populations grows to big for Earth and need more space. In the article in says that NASA has already set ships and since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Its safe to say that this mission is harder than any other, but its not impossible. Venus is probably the best plant to study maybe besides Mars but it had so much incommon with Earth there is chance it may work. In paragraph 4 it says "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus becasue it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long age, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of live, just like earth."Venus and Earth are alike in a lot of ways.

Those are some reasons to study Venus. That planet and our planet are so similar that maybe that could be the next plant we step foot in. It may take decades but if achieved that could be one of our best accomplishments. So maybe think about why it is important to study our galaxy.
