In today's society being on your phone while driving is a big problem. Using a cellular device while operating a vehicle can often lead up to death or serious injuries. Drivers should not be on their phones while driving, they should be paying attention to the road and everything around them.

Reason people should not be on the phone while driving is because you have to not only be safe for yourself but people around you. People don't always drive cars you have people on motorcycles too. There has been a rise in deaths on motorcycles because people have been paying more attention to their phones and by the time they look up it is too late to react, and now someone life is taken cause of these cellular devices.
