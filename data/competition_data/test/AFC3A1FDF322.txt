The principal said "You must participate in at least one extracurricular activity". This will be a bad idea and will likely not help the success of students and it could drop a lot of students grades. We should have a choice if we would like to be in an extracurricular activity or not. I speculate that if/when this change happens Students would have a lot more stress on thier minds with how much time they have to do homework and other things. Students are already too stressed and with this rule it would make there stress even worse. Another thing that would happen is that the health of students could be bad with the sleep they would have. Think about it ,Students have school and then they have extracurricular activities and also need to do their homework thats about 10-12 hours just for school work and just imagine how much stress the students who have jobs will have. One last thing that would happen if this new rule goes in place is Students would have less time for themselves. With the students who have jobs and other stuff it could be real hard to keep going to after school activities let alone going to their jobs.

First is that students will feel more stressed out and their grades could be effected because students already feel stressed without the rule in place, with the rule in place they would have a lot more stress and that could effect their grades. Another reason is that if students had a job they would half too quit it because they would not have time to do the jobs. They could even get less sleep and that could also lead to more stress and it could be unhealthy for the student who have homework and jobs. A lot of students grades grades will differently be effected with the extracurricular activities that students would need to do. They should keep it the way it is now because students can still do it but they wont be forced to do it. That way it will let students do extracurricular activities and let the other students do what they need to do. For example they will have more time to themselves and are able to do more things.

Second is that students will be unhealthy and that could also lead to stress and bad habits. One way they could be unhealthy is by not sleeping for that long which can turn into a habit which also causes stress instead of going to bed at 8-10 PM they will go to sleep at 12-1 AM doing their homework and working. The best thing to do is leave it as it is so students would be healthier and use their time more wisely. Another thing we could do is make school shorter so we can have more sleep and have more time to our selves which will make students more healthy and get better grades in school. we should be able to choose or have the choice if we would like to join a extracurricular activities because it would lead to success and healthy habits.

My last reason is that students will have less time for themselves, students need some time for themselves especially teenagers. They are changing and they dont know the world so they need a lot of time for themselves. with them basically forcing us to do after school activities students will feel like they have zero time and some students wont even do their school work which will affect their grade. Again by making school shorter students will have time for themselves for example they can work on jobs or do their homework or other stuff like learning how to drive and a lot more stuff. Also by shortening the time teachers wont half to work as much and students skipping school would probably decrease. Also with less school time more students will go to after school activities so the principal and the students both win!

In conclusion if the school goes with the rule "You must participate in at least one extracurricular activity". This will be a bad idea and will likely not help the success of students. it would damage the success of students , make students do unhealthy habits, and give students less time to do things. A fix to this would be to make school hours shorter so students will have enough time to do extracurricular activities and more students would succeed more. This way the student and principal get what they want along with teachers having to do less work. hopefully they will not go through with the decision and instead make school shorter. If they do change it than school will change badly forever.
