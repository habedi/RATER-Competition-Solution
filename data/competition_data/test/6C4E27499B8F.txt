School could be a very intimidating place, or it could be a place of fun or comfort. No matter your preference you should be wherever you feel you can succeed and achieve your goals. And that is why students who attend classes at home could benefit more then attending an actual school. Students who attend classes from home could benefit more because they would have less distractions from other students, they would be able to move at there own pace, and also feel more comfortable in there own environment.

There could also be some benefits for students attending classes at school. Like socializing with other students and learning with others. Also extra curricular activities and sports. But if a student is not comfortable in there environment and feel like they are not preforming there best, They should not be there.

A classroom full of multiple students could be very distracting. There could be multiple things going on. For example kids talking in the middle of a lesson, or some type of noises. It could be very hard to concentrate on the teachers instructions. That is why a student learning from home could benefit him/her because it is just the student and the teacher. It lets them focus more on what they are being told and less of what is going on around them. It also allows them to take in every bit of the information they are being taught. It just makes it easier for the student to learn.

In a single class there could be 30 students at once. They are all trying to understand what they are being taught. But if you fall behind in a class of 30 students a teacher is not going to stop the entire lesson just for one person. That is why if it is just you there is no possible way you can fall behind because it is just you. There is no rush to gather all the information your brain doesnt have to be going 100 mph for one thing. It is your time and your speed. It allows students to fully gather the information in there head and process it fully so they understand. And it makes the student calm so he or she can fully focus without the rush of a normal classroom.

Learning from home is probably one of the best places you can learn because it is your home. It is a place you are comfortable in a place you know like the back of your hand. You know where everything is and you know everyone that is there. If you go to a normal class there could be things changing everyday somethings you might not like somethings that could make you uncomfortable. There are many things that could happen at a school with so many things going on around you and so many people around it can make you feel very uneasy at times. That is why learning from the comfort of your own home could make students more comfortable with learning and just being in there own environment.

A education is very important for everyone it is your ticket to great things and a successful life. And you should be able to choose where you want to get an education. And getting an education from home can be very beneficial. Students who attend classes from home could benefit more because they would have less distractions from other students, they would be able to move at there own pace, and also feel more comfortable in there own environment. Working from home can be more beneficial than from a regular school and could lead to more success in the long run.
