Venus is dangerous and scientist cant get close enough to study it . Scientist are to just study Venus but cause of its crushing atmosphere and hot temperatures and wether. Scientist cant get close enough to the planet to study it so they are trying to create a solution on how to. The scientist already know if they get to close to the planet the planet will crush them and if it is possible to land it is way to hot. So scientist have came up with a solution thinking if they can hover over the planet will they be able to study it.

Scientist believe that Venus once use to thrive with life. Scientist believe that Venus many years ago Venus had oceans with life like earth. And also that Venus is close to the same size as Earth along with Mars. And thats why they may believe it had some life on the planet. They have made some electronics to go along with Venus harsh conditions but it is said that it only lasted 3 weeks. So they are trying something old called mechanical computers.

These mechanical computers and stand harsh conditions such as pressure,heat, and other forces. The mechanical computers are more powerful flexible and quick they played a important role in 1940s of world war 2. Since electronics cannot stand harsh conditions of Venus they are using something that does not require it. The mechanical computer only uses gears and levers which makes it good for the job. As the scientist work on it they are taking it on as a challenge to see the surface of Venus .
