Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should let anyone with a C average or up play sports. My reasons are because some people do really try to bring their grades up, but a C or higher would be good for me. And second, lots of people are very talented, and they need to use their talent for something. For instance, when a person is good at a sport, they should play it. If you really think about it, there are people famous because of what they do, sing, playing softball, cheering, anything that makes the person happy. It is really good exercise for people also. Sports can be good for fitting in too. If a person has a lower grade than a C then I wouldn't give them the opportunity to play sports. First they would have to bring their grades up. I really think it would help some people, maybe just to get something bad that happened off of their mind. That's mostly what any kid does, is play sports all day long. Thank you.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
