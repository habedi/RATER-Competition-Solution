Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have recently heard that you are thinking about raising the grade to a b average for athletic participation. I myself disagree with this. I would want to keep it at a c average because some students who are very good athletically don't have very good grades. How would you feel to see a star athlete sit on the bench the whole game because he never turned an assignment in or he failed a test. This in my opinion is very wrong and you should keep it as it stands at a c average.

My first reason why you should keep it to a c average is because students don't have very good grades. This goes for athletic participation, after school activities, etc. For example if they make a 75% in math class but they make b' s in Language arts, Science, and Social Studies and you sit them out for a whole to games that wouldn't be fair. I remember my sixth grade year when my mom and dad saw my report card and they said "son, so what do you think we are going to do". I remember not being able to go to my games, practices, friends houses, and other fun activities like that. Please don't take this away from the students who work hard at what they do in football, basketball, baseball, and other sports let em roll with a c and they can go on in life.

My last reason why they should be able to participate with a c is because we all know they work very hard in school. This includes working hard on tests, quizzes, class work, homework, etc. If I were a coach I would get onto the student and tell him to get it together if he had a c average, but I wouldn't make him sit on the bench at games or practices. If I were you I would take this into a big consideration.

To my conclusion don't take this away from a student with a c average. Let them go far in life. Let them dream. If they're stars let them shine. This is all I have to say and I hope you give it some thought, thank you.!
