I believe that the school summer projects should be designed by the teachers. I think this because projects designed by students can be unclear regarding the information of the project and students can also create a project that is not difficult enough and does not show the skills or levels of an individuals learning.

The first reason I believe teachers should design the school summer projects is because of the unclear information given on the project that students may create. With students designing a project some of them may have different knowledge on a specific topic. For example, the topic of the project being designed is United States History. The instructions of the project is to write a biography on George Washington. The two students designing the project want to include one fact about George Washington in the instructions to get students completing the project started. They decide they want the fact to be about George Washington time as president. Student A believes that George Washington was the first president of the United States but student B believes that George Washington was the third president of the United States. Both students believe that they are correct, this then causes arguments between the creators of the project and possible incorrect information being given to the students completing the project. The teachers know that the correct answer is George Washington was the first president of United States of America, but how would the students know the correct answer if they are the ones designing the project and can not agree? That is a big problem because the project is suppose to help the students continue learning over the summer.

The second and final reason I believe teachers should design the school summer projects is because students can create a project that is not difficult enough and does not show the skills or levels of an individuals learning process. This can be an effect of peer pressure, laziness, tiredness, and lack of information. I say that one cause of this is peer pressure because students are constantly negatively influenced by their peers. For example, if student A

friends finds out he is designing the project and ask him to make the project easy, because they do not want to do work over the summer, student A might be persuaded to do so because they are his friends and he does not want them to think bad of him. Another two reasons I think cause this are laziness and tiredness. I say these two together because often time when you are tiered you tend to get lazy, and when lazy it could be because you are tiered. Students tend to be lazy at times which affect their work effort and if that student is designing a project it can be sloppy and not put together because of it. Students are not use to creating lesson plans, like projects. This may cause a student to be tiered and of track. They can make many errors and mistakes if not well rested. My final reason I believe causes this is lack of information. Some student learn and comprehend at different speeds and if the student creating the project does not have enough information it can cause the project to be difficult to understand for the ones completing it.

In conclusion, I believe that the school summer projects should be designed by the teachers, because projects designed by students can be unclear regarding the information of the project, students can create a project that is not difficult enough and does not show the skills or levels of an individuals learning, and there are numerous problems that go along with a student designing a project rather than a teacher who is used to and well informed with information about all subjects.
