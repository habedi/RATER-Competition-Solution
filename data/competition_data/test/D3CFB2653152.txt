Alot of people might think that aliens have lived on Mars and formed a face of an alien artifact on Mars. But I think that the face is just a natural landform.

The reason I think that it was created by a landform is because on JPL web site it showed a clearer photo of the face on Mars. Most landforms are around the American West. So we can look at the landforms around the American West as a guide line to compare photos alot easier. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho, says Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

By the looks of it it seems like the Face on Mars looks like it was created by a natural landform on Mars by the looks of the photo graphs.
