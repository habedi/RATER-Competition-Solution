Dear Principal

I think that the first policy apply because people use there cell phones for mor than just goofing off. They can be used as a thing to tell some on I'm sick pick me up please, or if an emergency pops up so these are the reasons why.

First, what if a student was sick or had a condition that was very embarrassing to them if they had there cell phones they could call or text during the free time and be less embarrassed, where as if they couldn't they would have to ask to go to the teacher and ask to go to the office.

Second, another reason is that what if an emergency at home or elsewhere where there parents or siblings where injured in a car crash or a fire at home. For a example at SCHOOL_NAME

they can sign up for text messages from the university for dangerous things that would be going on.

Third, cell phones can also be a distraction so maybe the would give up there cell phone in each class. students love there cell phones all I'm saying is that student can do so much more than just text or call ,its more of a connivance than need but it is very helpful.

In conclusion, school might be safer with a cell phone around students to reportr something happening or putting warning texts out.
