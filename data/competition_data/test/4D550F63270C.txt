Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm aware that you are questioning weather to make community service for the students at this school mandatory or not. When making your decision, it's important to remember that either way, someone will not be happy. Still, you must make a choice. I have my own opinion on the matter, and I'd like to share it with you before you decide weather to implement this rule or not.

At the current time, many of my fellow students perform community service regularly. The help the people and the world around them. However, other students oppose community service. This isn't because they want to make the world a better place, I'm sure we all want that, but it's a matter of time. The teens at this school, and everywhere else, would much rather do something else that the enjoy more. If they have free time, they aren't going to think to themselves, "Well I have nothing to do for the next two hours. I'll go help out at the animal shelter!" To me, this is a disappointment.

Implementing this rule would have a very positive effect on the students here at this school. It would encourage teens to help out their community. You'd be teaching them to donate their time to make the world better. Even after they've left this school, they'd continue to help people. This rule will teach the students to help people, making better people for the future. Think of the rule as training wheels on a bike. We'll need them to start, but eventually we won't. One thing to remember is that everyone wouldn't be happy instantly. Many students would moan and groan, but that would only last a few weeks, maybe a month. A month of complaining for a lifetime of compassion seems like a good deal doesn't it?

Despite my opinion, the choice is yours. Still, I strongly advise you to review what I've said and take it into account. I know you will make the best decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
