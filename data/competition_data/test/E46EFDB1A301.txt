I agree with the principal because I think the students should do one activity. The students sould do it because they would be nothing when doung nothing in life so that's why they should do the activity's at school. I think that the activity's the students are doing is amazing becuase I want to do those things at school. I think that all the students should do sports because it is fun to do.

Next, I want all the students to be sucessful and life so they should do the activity's at school to be something when they grow. You can't be nothing if you just sit around all day so if they really love the activity they should folow their dreams. If they love sports they can play sports if they love to be a student council they can be a student council so never stop following your dream.

Then, I want the audience to agree with me. I think that the principal did a amazing job of thinking about this and i like the idea of it. I wise that my principal will think about this and do it because it would be fun and that i wll love it.

In conclusion, you can tell that I agree with the principal about one activity and I think that the students should do it and that it is a great idea becuase i would do it.Â
