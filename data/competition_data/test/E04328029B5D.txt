I think that you should do policy one. I think this because if its off during class its not disturbing anyone, than during free time, lunch and etc. You should be able to use them because if you go with policy two. Than some people wouldn't have away to contact their parents when they got off the bus, in case the door was locked to the house. Or someone broke into your house you wouldn't have away to contact your parents when you got off the bus. There is so many things that could happen and you wouldn't be able to contact your parents because you couldn't bring your phone to school. So this is some reason s why we should be able to bring are phones to school but have them off during class. Either way if you choose policy two kids are going to still bring them anyways, because they might need to contact their parents after school or if you play sports for the school you might need your phone. You might need your phone to let your parents know what time to pick you up after school. These are some reason why you would need your phone. So i think you should go with policy one it is much better than policy two.
