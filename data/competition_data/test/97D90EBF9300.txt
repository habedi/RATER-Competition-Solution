As a result 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars.57 percent sold a car to move here. Vauban completed inn 2006 , Is a example of a growing trend in Europe, The united states and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. As a componet of a movement called "smart planning".

The end of car culture. President Obama's ambitious goals are to curb the United states' greenhouse gas emissions. Unvail last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in America behavior,recent studies suggest that America are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year gose by. Americas love affair with its vehicals seems to be cooling down. when adjusted for population growth ,the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and stedily dropped thereafter. Therefor if the pattern is perists and many sociologist belive it will ,It will have benefical impacts on the world's carbon emissions. so let all try to be car free and hgelp the enviroment!
