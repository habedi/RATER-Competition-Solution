Exploring Venus has been a challenge that humans have been striving to explore for over three decades. In my opinion I believe that someday humans will colonize Venus but not anytime soon so there is no point in continuing to study it. In this article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I believe that the author did a great job with their claim and that they used many details to support their claim but they did not go into detail on the cost of these studies. The article is about the challenges and drawbacks from being able to explore Venus and the precautions that are needed to be put into account when trying to explore it.

As I have said, I believe that Venus will some day be explored and colonized. However I do not believe it will be any time soon due to the fact that there are hundreds of different drawbacks and challenges that are needed to be strategized before we can take a living human up there. Some of those challenges and drawbacks that are needed to be taken into account are that we do not have the necessary equipment to withstand the atmosphere on Venus made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets as said in the article. In addition, there are temperatures that average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus. Those temperatures are beyond anything that has ever been created to withstand heat.

In reality, anything that is sent to Venus will probably be melted and destroyed before even landing on the planet. I say this because the atmospheric pressure of Venus is 90 times greater than Earths. I can support this because in the article it says, "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans have ever encountered on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals." Even if Venus was once the most Earth-like planet why keep sending unmanned spacecrafts to Venus. The only thing that scientists are accomplishing are a few results on how to modify their spacecrafts but they are wasting their money on something that probably will not be accomplished in their lifetime.

In conclusion, Venus is one of those planets that humans are so fascinated by but it has many drawbacks and dangers. Therefore I do not agree with the authors claim but I do believe that they did a great job with using details to support their claim. In my opinion, due to the drawbacks and challenges that need to be solved in order to even land on the planet Venus, I believe that exploring Venus is a complete waste of time as of right now. If the exploration of Venus was coming any time soon then it would not have taken NASA three decades to get to the point that we are at now.
