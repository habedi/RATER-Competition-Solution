Each and every day around the world, thousands of students are given assignments or projects they must complete and turn in for a proficient grade, some of these projects are assigned during the school year and sometimes they are assigned during the summer when students are on vacation just to help with their continued learning. Summer projects should be student-designed. Many students would be so much more successful and accurate if their summer projects were student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because students make topics sound easier than teacher-designed projects, teacher-designed projects take quite some time to complete, and students make projects and topics more enjoyable.

Students make school topics sound more simple than teachers. Usually when a teacher designs a summer project there is a lot to it and makes simple subjects or topics sound more difficult than what it actually is. As an example if a teacher were to assign an English summer project there would be three sheets of paper and a whole lot of words to it, but if a student were to assign an English summer project then there would be less wording and it would get straight to the point. Another example could be a teacher designing a history project. If a teacher were to design a history summer project then the directions would be unclear and confusing for most students, but if a student were to design a history summer project then the directions would be simple.

Furthermore, teacher-designed projects can take quite some time to complete. Students enjoy projects that are quick and enjoyable to complete in a timely manner. Teacher-designed projects are long and drawn out, sometimes it can even take a student a month or two to get one summer project complete. If a student were to design a summer project then it would be quick, simple, and would probably only take a week or two to complete. An example of this would be a typical summer reading project, they are designed by teachers. Most of the time students will wait the week before the summer reading is due to start it just because of how drawn out they are. But if a student were to design the summer reading project, then it would not take that much time to complete and the student would get it done in a much more timely manner.

Some people might say that teacher-designed summer projects are efficient and accurate, but most of the time these "efficient and accurate" projects are very uninteresting for students to complete. Teacher-designed projects usually require the student to read something out of a textbook and answer guided reading questions, this is not interesting to students at all. If a student were to design a summer project for a specific topic, then for most students it would actually be enjoyable. An example would be a student getting a summer project for mathematics. These teacher-designed math projects usually require the students to solve a lot of problems, this could take days, weeks, or months for the student to complete because it is not interesting. If a student were to design a math project it would probably require them to do something that applies to their everyday life, which is very interesting for a student.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because students make topics sound more simple than teacher-designed projects, teacher-designed projects take more time to complete, and students make summer projects more enjoyable to complete. Students would not have to stress over the project being too difficult or unclear, the student would be able to complete the project on time, and they would enjoy doing the project during their summer vacation. Students can be the reason other students succeed with their projects or assignments and they could learn so much from each other just from one simple summer project.
