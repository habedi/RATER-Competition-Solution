Dear Principal,

I think that all students should be required to perform community service. I think this for many reasons. Doing community service will be a great role model to younger ones. It will help influence them in the best ways yet. Participating in community service will also help students get into a great college in the future. Last but not least, helping the community is a great way to be involved. If you do not play a sport, or attend any after-school activities, community service is the way to go! Community service improves people's knowledge of their community and its people.

The thought of community service may not sound fun at all, but when you dig a little deeper, it is magnificent. First, what is the community? The community is everything and everyone around you. Even the people you do not associate with. Community service is volunteering to help out peers and others around you. Students should be required to participate in community service because it gives them a chance to learn how to help others out. This will help develop social and mental skills. The more they help out, the less there is to do around the community. Next thing you know, the park that used to be filthy and smelly is clean as a whistle! Four hands are always better than just two.

Helping out the community not only gives students a chance to learn about how to help out and socialize more, but also a chance for them to attend a remarkable college in the future. Colleges have many requirements; some may include involvement with the community, and others include school involvement in clubs. Having a record of community service will be perfect. With everyone pitching in to help out the community, everyone will become a better person.

Being a better person means being a role model for your peers and siblings around you. Helping out the community will give them the opportunity to see what it is like to help out. When they see that, they will become influenced and plan about participating in the future. Doing more for the community is always best. Whether it is picking up trash that people have littered in the local park, or it is cutting the grass at the public library. It is all apart of helping the community. Students should do this because it is a great experience. They will have new knowledge on ways to help out the community and ways to become a better person.

So why should they be required to do community service? Well, community service has many definitions, but it always leads up to one thing. Helping out the community. It is all apart of life. Being involved will get you to many levels. You'll become a better person and a respected volunteer. Do not only do it for respect, but also for honor and pride in yourself. You'll feel great. You will feel like a good Samaritan. You have lent a hand to your community and you deserve a great pat on the back. The local park is now cleaner than ever and your public library's grass is freshly cut and green like the crayon. Students becoming involved in the community will benefit everyone. It will cause a chain reaction to others in the community. People will say, "Wow!" "What a great improvement!" I'd like to join. They'll volunteer and so on so forth. All is well the ends well. Community service will lead to many levels of success.

Yours truly,
