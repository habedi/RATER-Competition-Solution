Summer in many students mind should be outgoing, much fun, experience new things, and much more. Students tend to forget everything about school and just enjoy themselves not thinking of the upcoming, more challenging year for the students. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have access to the full year curriculum and teachers have a lot more of a planning experience than students. Next is students have a hard time with attention span with a lot of free time on their hands and that could cause troubles in creating their own summer project.

First reason on why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers have full access to the full year curriculum and they are better off planning a few months worth of a project to keep a students mind going rather than a student creating his/her own. Although students have a better chance with creativity and forming their own project over the summer, teachers have a better end of forming a set project for the students to work on over the summer. For example, Generic_Name is about to get out of school and he's headed to Texas for a vacation over the summer. Therefore he probably wont have too much time to form and create his own project over the summer. Luckily, his teacher Generic_Name created a summer round project for the entire class to complete over the summer and turn in the following year. Due to his teacher assigning a project rather than him having to create his own, he could bring the project with him and complete it within a timely manner. This would take a lot of stress off his shoulders and could give a lot more time to complete the actual project rather than having to brainstorm for some time.

The next reason on why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because students have a hard time with attention span over the summer and it could cost them a lot of trouble in creating their own projects. Most students over the summer want to go out and enjoy time with family, have time with themselves, and overall just enjoy summer. When a set assignment is given out it gives the student enough time to complete it and space it out among the few months that they are out of school. If they have to create their own; yeah it may keep them a little more entertained but overall it wont have them feeling obligated to do the assignment, making them back off from it. If you give the student a teacher-designed assignment and have a due date and directions on the assignment, it may have them feeling obligated to complete the assignment causing a lot more focus on what needs to be done. For example, if a teacher hands you a project or packet and its organized with set dates to have each section complete, a student will be more engaged along with be on track rather than being unorganized and having to bunch stuff together and become stressed and possibly putting your mind strictly into "summer fun". Stress, boredom, regrets are all reasons students dont complete summer work but it would help out a lot if all summer projects were teacher-designed.

Well organized, structured well, units spread out, set time and dates, and much more will help a student out and have students more engaged in summer projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to keep students learning over summer. Summer should be about fun and excitement but students have to keep their brains working and prepare themselves for the upcoming school year. Keep students mind in "learning mode" during the summer could make it or break it for the students following year, it could also determine how much the student will struggle and not struggle.
