Dear TEACHER_NAME , I think cell phones should be allowed at school and to used only during free periods and turned off during class. because what if there is an emergency and the student needs to get a whole of their parents and they aren't allowed to used the schools phone. while some students used them for additions purpose's .they would have to be turned off during class so that the students will be able to learn not to focused on who's calling them or texting them . there should be a three pass rule just like the bathroom passes if you are caught using the cell phone not during free periods you would get a warning . a detention, and then the phone gets taken away. If these rules are enforced then maybe students wont need to tried to slip to use their phone during the school hours. I hope you will see my point in why students should be allowed to use cell phones during free periods.
