In those thousands of accidents there are also some teens who were also in a car accident. Many deaths have happened during those accidents and it all happened just because we as humans seem to be too attached to phones and can not wait any longer to text back or to return a call.

If a teen gets pull over they will get points taken away from their driving permit and will also get a ticket. If people think about it, sending a text is not worth paying a ticket with the money that you could have bought something for themselves.
