Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I think that you should not require all students to complete community service. One reason why is because we do not have time. Another reason why is because we could be focused on our school work. Also there are student that are apart of outside programs. This would really be putting stress on some of the students at SCHOOL_NAME.

First reason students do not have time for community services. Some students really don't have time because they might play sports or have academics to focus on. If you went to practice then you just get out and you have to go do community services that id very tiring. I know because i play three sports and when I get out of practice I just want to go home and rest. Also what if some students have lots of chores to do and you had a long day at school then you'll have to do chores then community service. Now put yourself in our shoes.

Another reason why community service should not be required is because lots of kids should be more focused on school work. I think kids our age are already stressed out on trying to make good grades and if you make this a requirement that'll be really hard. Our grades will start dropping, early drop-outs, and depression. we should be focused on getting prepared for a test the next day or homework getting turned in.

My last reason why is because most students are apart of outside programs. say that you are apart of the church choir and you have practice that is a lot to do community service than go to practice. Or you play sports or even if you have tutoring that's a lot of hard work to do for just a normal 8th grader. You guys should already know how hard it is to already do extra things in one day.

First reason was we would not have time for community service. Another we said that we should be more focused on our school work. also I said that what we have other outside programs we were in that will b e hard work. This will be very stressful on a normal 8th grader sincerely STUDENT_NAME
