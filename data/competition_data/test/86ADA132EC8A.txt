a claim for this using technology is that we can use another electronic devices like ipads, phones, ect, no just the computer to read students emotional expressions.

Ex.

"For intances, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face".(5)

Well just imagine some electronics devices that can know how you feel on that moment or if you are angry or sad things like that. That would be good for real because literraly robots know how you are and that is crazy because that is like a electronic device talk to you.

Ex.

"If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different".(6)

That can be relly good and funny because that can make you happy if you are sad and imagine that the electronic device tell you "Smile don't be sad and be fun" in my opinion that would be good too. If that happen a lot of people would be happy because that is a really good stuff to make the people happy.

If i could create a electronic device i would create like a phone, a computer or pc with that thing of know if the people are sad or something like that because that is cool. If i can do that something on my life i will do it because i dont like to see the poeple sad, angry or whatever.
