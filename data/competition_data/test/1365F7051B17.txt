Dear principal i do think that we should help community service. I mean look at our economy, scientist have been saying that we have little tiny holes in our hemisphere because of us littering. You would think that after us hearing about that we would care more about earth and would start throwing our trash away where it belongs. My opinion schools should have the kids like once a weak pick up trash around the school, and during summer plant flowers and maybe even trees. The state should give the schools money so we can help the earth. Also instead of throwing our garbage in a hole why don't we burn it?

What we also can do is help stores and banks. Why don't the state just pay for heavy duty windows and doors? If they care so much really they should do that, I mean yes people now a days are stupid and if they want to be stupid then they can be sent to jail i understand that but, when we can just make that certain stuff so that stupid people wont be taken from their families.

For all the students out there in their schools that don't get taught well we should do something about it then just standing around. I mean like my school, a lot of peoples grades are down, not just cause of the students but because of the teachers. For example one of my teachers when i raise my hand for help she helps me on a completely different topic that i never asked for. I think that we really need to take a foot down and have the state help us with what ever that we need. Also in SCHOOL_NAME they complain how the students are failing a lot of the classes, but to be honest if they care that much they wont give us super hard problems on the test and homework, and for the algebra students teachers give them homework that the teachers hasn't even gone over.

Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
