This technology is not important in a classroom setting, because why spend so much money on something the human eye can do? According to the text, in paragraph 5, it states, "For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." They add this here to explain what the technology is seeing, but really, if you think about it, it's really saying that we can already do what this equipment can for much cheaper. The only way I see this peice of technology would be useful, is when students get confused while working on a device. According to paragraph 6, it states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." While this is an interesting factor, we can also look at how many people these days "freak out" because, supposedly, the FBI is watching us through our computer cameras, and now we're welcoming technology because it can read our emotions? Someone could easily see this as an opportunity to hack into the cameras at the school, and watch children. Nobody would be aware of what is really happening, and the preditor would get away with watching students while they're trying to do their work. I do not see this sort of technology as a reliable source because we can do the same thing by looking at a person, and we're welcoming technology into schools that could easily get hacked, and all of a sudden, we have unknown people watching our students while in school.
