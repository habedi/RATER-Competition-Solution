Computers detecting how the user is feeling. Although a computer could track by using your browser history that is sort of invading your privacy. But by simply just seeing how you react to what exactly is on your screen is a much easier alternative. This program could positivly affect the veryday compuiter life in many aspects. School, work , and home could be much simplier for everyone.

I find this to solve so many inconviences for computer users. There has been many of times where an ad has popped up that I've declined because I'm not interested well the author states "If you smile when an Web add appears on your screen, a simular ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent." Also in a classroom the article says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." That way the necessary changes can be made to the program. That could possibly improve grades, and students will to work in the classroom.

Out of all the evidence given in the article i do trust this will be a good thing. Some may think of this to be invading ones privacy or may not be accurate. But it is not , the computer is just simply seeing how you react to things only on the computer. With the accuracy the computer go by what face you make, it tracks every single muscle you use. What I'm saying is even the slightest smirk it will know how you feel about what is on your screen. I think this is a great way for computer producers to try to understand exactly what the user prefers. I also really do think this could especially improve school life everywhere.
