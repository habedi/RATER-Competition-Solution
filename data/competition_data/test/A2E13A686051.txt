After school,most students go home and watch TV ,take naps,or be on there phone for multiple hours,I agree with this new decision because it gives students a chance to stay after school with there friends to get physical activity, and interact with other students.

Without this new decision students may not show interest in extracurricular activities, and many people will not sign up. It is important that this decision was made because students would not sign up on there own.

An option that students have when they sign up is after school sports. After school sports are important because it is where most students get physical activity other that PE. Not only do students get physical activity but they also learn how to stay healthy and fit, and they start developing habits of exercise. Students also learn how to work with there team to advise plans or solve issues. Working as a team can be helpful to some students because they have each other to back them up and point things out that the other person did not realize.

Another option that students have, is to serve in the student council. The student council can be helpful to some people, because it teaches you valuable skills. Some skills the student council teaches you is to be responsible and trust worthy. Students who are a part of the student council are tying to make there school a better place, and they often have people counting on them so they have to be trust worthy and accountable. That can teach students as well because they know that they are being counted on and they have to step up.

In conclusion, I agree with the principles decision because students will get a chance to stay after school with there friends to get physical activity,interact with other students and learn to help there community.
