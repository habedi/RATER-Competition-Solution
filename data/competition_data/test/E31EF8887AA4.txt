This policy will not be fair ,because other students will like to play sports and their grade are C,D and F. The principal would be fair because, it like saying that he only want smart people to play the school sports. The students will also participate in other school activity. they will also like to go to school field trip ,but they will not be able to because their grade is a C or lower. Mostly many student in the school have a C almost half of the student we be able to participate in school activity or sports. Most likely student like to participate in activity a C its a good grade but a B is better. Some student would to be in the school soccer team, football team, basketball team, baseball team or other school activity. For me this policy wont be fair so my choice is not to be assigned in the school.
