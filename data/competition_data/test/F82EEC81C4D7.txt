Dear Principle:

I think that students should be required to do community service to help keep there community safe, well educated, and clean. It may upset some students but its good for there community so it can be the way they want it to be. However, it will take time away from spending time with friends. So as a result of doing the community service students should be rewarded with credits or homework passes.

Have you ever thought that your community was not clean or well educated? Well, now it can be for if the students help out and do community service for the community. It would be good for the students to help out ,because it will set an example for the younger kid so when they get older they will follow in there foot steps.

It would be good for the community because it will keep the community clean, and well educated. Some students may like it because they could get their friends involved and hang out will there helping there community out. Some of the students may not like it cause there friends don't want to do it with them so they don't want to do it cause there friends don't want to do it.

This may upset students because there friends wont do it with them. It may interfer with there plans for that week. It may mess up there schedule because they are in sports. It may mess up there weekend.
