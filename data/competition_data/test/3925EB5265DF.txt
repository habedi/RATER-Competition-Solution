Students are brought immense joy with the thought of summer. When the thought of summer projects arrive however, they feel extremely stressed. Although some may think this stressful feeling may be alleviated if the students designed their own summer projects, teachers prevent more stress by creating these projects themselves. Teachers should be the designers of summer projects, ensuring that students retain large amounts of vital knowledge during the summer and have a smooth, organized transition back into school.

If teachers customized these projects, it would become more organized, making things lighter on the instructor when grading them. Teachers are the ones responsible for grading every individual project. With their own policies for a project, they can grade over those policies with ease. This ensures the most smooth and organized grading of the project, deterring struggle for the teachers and students. Assignments are easier to grade when there is a strict, self-made outline created for them. If they are the creators of the project, teachers can easily evaluate how to grade each project. Some may think that students can create great outlines that are easy to grade upon; however, teachers can create a better outline considering that they are the graders themselves. With the ability of creating policies in the most organized way, teachers can grade these assignments with maximum ease, preventing stress on both sides.

Teachers are heavily educated on the content students must know. They are made to teach, due to their immense amount of personal knowledge. This personal knowledge teachers contain can be used to assist students greatly with schoolwork of a specific topic. Teachers should create the structure of these projects because they can provide students with important knowledge in the subject .

Although some may believe that students have the ability to support themselves with the use of the internet, teachers are a more reliable source for assistance, seeing that many websites contain unreliable facts. The school system tells teachers the specific topics students must have remembrance of. With the idea of the subjects students must remember, teachers can assist them in retaining the knowledge that is found to be the most necessary for them. If teachers design these projects, it will ensure that students will have the vital knowledge and assistance needed to have a smooth transition back into school.

Teachers can instruct better when they create the assignment given. Instructors teach their students based on the summer assignment given. Creating the project themselves would help the teacher instruct the students on a specific, self-created basis. Instruction would become easier to do for the teacher and the student would not be confused, due to working upon the same basis. Although some may think that students have the capability of creating such a basis, teachers are more experienced in doing that, as it is a part of their job. If instructors make the students' summer assignments, then teaching and learning would become easier.

With the many benefits it would provide for each student and instructor, teachers should be the ones to create the structure of the students' summer projects. With their creation, students will retain the most important knowledge. Students will be stripped form unnecessary distress as well as teachers. Having instructors create summer assignments is a better idea than having students do so.
