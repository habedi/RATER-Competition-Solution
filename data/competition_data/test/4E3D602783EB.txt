Dear TEACHER_NAME, I Believe that students should be able to be on any sports in the school in SCHOOL_NAME if they have any chance of passing they classes by and C Because one reason is for one they is still passing they classes , for two its not a bad grade at all , and for three i know students could get they C From being a C And make it into a B or and A .

Why i chose this because they are still passing they classes at a C and most schools says that if your passing by a chance of one C Did you could be on any sport team you want to . I could see if students have a C Form they first report card and they start bring down they grades than you could kick them off the sport they play .

Another reason why i chose this because C Is not a bad grade . Any C is not a bad grade unless you have A Low C and is bring your grade down to a D . Now if you have an High C Its a different story because your bring your grade up to a B Or and A like it should be .

My last reason why i picked this is any student could get a C and make it an A or B

that's easy if your really paying close to the board and the teacher its nothing you could get your grades up like that . Also you always have to do your work and don't skip class , don't be late because you might miss something that was very important that you needed to know , but when you was late you needed to know what was the lesson and you don't know what it was.

Also and when report cards come out and you see your grades and its a D or and F than you are going to be very unhappy with it . But it's really going to be on you because maybe you wasn't in class or you came late or sleep or didn't do your work like you was suppose to .

Students should be able to be on any sport team if they have any kind of C as they grades.

I'm not saying you shouldn't let students not be on the team because i forgot one thing if they act bad in school in their class rooms you should let them be in anything because you dont come to school for that and when the fun thing pop up students want to be in everything and they cant because of they are acting up in school . But you should let students participate in any kind of activities in school .
