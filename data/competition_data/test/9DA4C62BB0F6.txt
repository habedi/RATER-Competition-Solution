So I'm driving in my nice great black colored Handa with black rims and green neon lights. But let me stop there I do not want to get into all of the details of the car. Like i was saying i was driving and next thing you know BOOM!! I collided with a nasty old rusty out fo style truckand ruine my car. I called 1800-411-pain and they will handle it. I guess i have usage for this car anymore and I can just walk. my point i"m making is that you don't need a car to get you where you go all the time. citizens can use other sources of transportations. Citizens need to take advantages of limting car usage for the u. s. and the world. i'm going to i'm inform citizens about advantages of limiting car usage.

First of all, a lot of citizens love their cars like i did. What some citizens don't know that cars are dangrous. Well I think everybody know that because of all the accidents and crash but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the pollutions. That the air is being polluted. Secondly, That is not the only thing. Riding bikes, walking, taking the bus, and taking a cab can help stop pollution. Now I'm not talking about taking away all cars. We have to take advantages of limiting the car usage.

Honestly, walking is not that bad and so is riding a bike. It is really good workout. It is also safer than cars if you don't trip or fall off your bike.

Also citizens won't cause congestion. Citizens don't also have pay bill and loans for their cars if you don't have one. Now i know some people have job to get to, so all you have to do is to wake up early for work ride a bike or take the bus arrive to work on time. If you was late and something comes up just make up a lie about why you are. At least you are helping out the world. Most of all, when you drive a car then a cop stops you and give you a ticket even though you didn't do nothing wrong. You can avoid that by just taking a bus. Also going to waste money on gas and the bus only 2 dollars. Like I said I'm saying that you should get rid of your car. i'm saying take advantage of limiting car usage.

In otherwise, in Vauban, Germany life goes on without the usage of cars. As a result, 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. They had to give residents ticket if they drive their. All I'm trying to say is take advantage of limiting car usage.
