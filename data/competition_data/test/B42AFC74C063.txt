Students should be allowed to make their own decisions and to not be forced into doing any activities others choose for them or make them do. If they are unable to cooperate physically and/or don't have the right type of mindset they should not participate. Not having that compatibility with certain subjects that others may have might be challenging for others to look forward to. It would be enticing to do these events but if you don't have many ideas for these things, it's disappointing. People would really look forward to those plans but when you lack skills it is hard.

Sports festivals will need pros who can win in any games or peoples they face up against. In "Work on the yearbook" section you will need skills of editing, drawing arts and photography. Last for student council you will need lots of ideas and ways to help the community and plan events. For those events and activities people will need time to do so, If you are unable to have that time nor someone to pick you up from those things then it's harsh to find someone who is willing to do so. You will need a family member or a close friend who can drive because these events may carry on longer then school buses can manage to take you home.

These activities that you may force on us may be a good thing in your head and to some other people but when you come back to reality there's a bigger picture. All these plans you want us to have to do is very tiring and time consuming, many people may not have the capabilities to do so. Finding the right time, ideas and perfectly cut out people for the job is extremely hard. This may not be as easy as it seams especially for the young and maturing as they're still trying to figure out paths they want to go down for the future, and how their brains are still developing. Students shouldn't have to participte if they are not willing to. Leave the choice up to them.
