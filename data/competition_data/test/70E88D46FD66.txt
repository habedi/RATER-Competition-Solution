Dear principal,

I believe community service is good for the community. It is good to help the community to me because some people can't be as lucky as others are. With community service you can try to help them. I mean there are all different community services to make your community better. So why not help out by taking some of your time out to help people and/or your community.

I believe community service is good and the opportunity shouldn't be wasted by sitting in the house playing video games, or watching T.V. When community service is out there you shouldn't waste it which it always is. Some kids do not believe someone when they say community service is fun but once you get into it, it may change your mind.

When you do community service it can also help you in life by showing people you care. Sometimes it might even look good on a college application and other times you can show people that you want the community to be better and show them that you care what happens to it and other people to. I do community service sometimes just to help people out and i believe that other kids should to. I think that to pass at least high school and graduate you need at least so many hours of community service. That could help the community out a lot even by just giving some money or serving dinner at a soup kitchen.

There could be fun community service and there could be boring. You can go to the soup kitchen and help serve food, you can go to a children's hospital and help out, or you can even just collect money or food for people that need help. That are not so lucky in there life. There are do many community services and i believe you should chose one or more and just give it a try maybe it will surprise you.

sincerely, a concerned student
