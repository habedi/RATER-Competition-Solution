Dear principle,

I do not believe that it is fair that students should have to have a "B" average in school to be able to play sports. Students should not have to have a "B" average because sports help kids get in shape , the students have only had to have a "C" average to play sports in the past, and a "C"

is a passing grade. This policy is not fair to the students.

This new school policy could prevent our students from losing weight. As a society America currently has more overweight children than ever before. It is imperative that students play sports to get in shape.

This is how our school can take part in helping our students lose weight.

Students have always only had to have a "C" average to be able to play sports. Why are we deciding to change that now? Some kids struggle with grades, and they cannot get a "B" average. I Believe that a "C" average is a more respectable agreement.

A "C" is a passing grade. I believe that if you are passing in school, you should be aloud to play sports. If the students are passing, than they are putting effort into their grades witch proves that they should be aloud to play sports. If you have a passing grade of a "C" average you should be aloud to play sports.

I don't believe that it is right to make kids have a "B" average for their average grade to play sports. Students should not have to have a "B"

average because sports help kids lose weight,

Students have only had to have a "C" average to play to play sports in the past, and

A"C" is a passing grade. Our principle should be more respectable of our students.
