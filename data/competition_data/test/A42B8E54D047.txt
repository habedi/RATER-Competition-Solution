Cell Phones Are Killers

The future brings many new advances in technology, and along with it, dangers and responsibilities. Cell phones are highly addictive, and although they are beneficial for connecting to the world and finding information efficiently, they have proven to be a major distraction and huge problem for drivers. People often get into car accidents while texting. Drivers should not be allowed within arm's reach of their mobile device because it can harm themselves and others on the road.

First of all, according to seriousaccidents. com, "Distracted drivers are the top cause of car accidents in the U.S. today." This means that texting while driving is more dangerous than being intoxicated behind the wheel. People - especially teenagers - can kill themselves and others when they text while operating a motor vehicle. If they're lucky to survive the crash but they kill others, they can serve up to 20 years in prison, according to criminal-law. freeadvice. com. 20 years is a serious amount of time to serve because of a text or call.

Secondly, many students get into car accidents due to texting. They can often collide with other students or adults and may cause an injury or death. Many people believe a text should be responded to in 10 minutes or less, so one can wait to arrive at their destination before texting again. Furthermore,, if a text is too important to ignore, a person should simply pull over so they can respond, instead of distracting themself from the road and putting others at risk.

Thus, no person should be allowed to have their phone while driving due to it posing a threat to one's own health and wellbeing, as well as others'. People should not answer texts or phone calls while they should be focused on the road when it can be such a huge distraction many problems can occur in the short period of time it requires to answer a phone call or text. It is much safer to simply wait to get to your destination.
