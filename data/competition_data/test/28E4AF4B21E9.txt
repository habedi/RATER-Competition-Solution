The Face on Mars is just a natural landform because, in my opinion i dont believe aliens are real. Here are the reasons why i think the Face on Mars has become just a natural landform.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a pictue ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for that image. When the image appeared on a JPL web site revealing just a natural landform peopole finally knew that there was no alien monument after all.

Another reason why i think The ''Face on Mars'' is just a natural lanform because, ''The Face on Mars'' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!

Some people think the Face is evidence of life on mars.

April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum resolution.

As a rule of thumb, you can turn things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small item, you would be able to see what they were!

In this argumentative essay i have tried to convince people that the Face is just a natural landform.
