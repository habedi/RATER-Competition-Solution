State senator i strongly suggest that you change the electroral speech to an election and these are some reason why you should do so. The elctoral speech has to many drematical erros that can occur and throw the whole election to a unpresidented one. Also the people that vote for a president won't be the one voting for him/her, but a slate of electros. Althought it does have an abundence of flase it does have a certainty of outcome. This could lead to a president that is wanted or was choosen by a tiny mistake that made a huge rupture in events.

With the implimation of the popular vote over the electoral college can allow citizens to express their thoughts on what new leader they would want to run their state. If they would vote on the electors it's not a one-hundred percent chance that they are willing to pick for your choice of president. '"Back in 1960, segregations in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Although the Electoral college has many flase that can effect the state drastically, it does have a certainty of outcome. With this it can lead to less dispute over the popular vote. "Almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis". Even if a state is low populated a state can cause a landslide in the Electoral-vote victory in that particular state. Also a greater factor that can occur is a tie which is possible because of the total number of votes which is an even number of 538. Even so they are two types of voting choices that people rather have, it can never be such a voting format that would be able to fit everyones style.
