Do people vote for the man who runs the country. No, thats the Electoral Colleges job. The Electoral College is a process in which a numerous 538 electors cast there vote from the people of their state want as their president. The people have no interaction but to put in there ballet and choose there own electors who favor the candidate. Congress counts the votes, and if a total of 270 votes are cast for a candidate then they are elected president. For most people this how they think this is but it's not. Who chooses the Electors the answer is the state. So the sometimes the popular vote never wins, but that that happens rarely.

Many people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole dislike the idea of Electoral College for this reason, the popular vote sometimes never wins. Al Gore who won popular vote but lost the presidency to Bush, lost the because of the Electoral College people believed that this was unfair and blamed the electoral college. But there is some benefits to the process, example is that if the people voted the states with the larges population would always keep the balance unchecked,or if there there is a tie in the popular vote we wouldn't have to rely on a thousand voters to decide. But the voters of the Electoral College to decide.

There are some draw backs to the process though. Since the number of electors are the based on the population of a state most state with few population numbers, careless about the election. There are reason why people find that we should keep the process,there are also reason many dislike the idea in the first place. Viewing the benefits and the weakness of the idea of the Electoral College made think that even though the College has flaws. Those flaws are rare and can be fixed, with proper work and planning.
