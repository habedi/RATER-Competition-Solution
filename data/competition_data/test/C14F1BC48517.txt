In Vauban, Germany, the citizens are not allowed to own cars and if they do, they're parked on outskirts of the city or in garages at the end of their developments. The citizens walk and bike ride places, and they refrain from using their vehicle as much as possible. Overall, people are happier. They're getting more exercise and are being able to enjoy the outdoors and communicate with eachother more than if you were passing your neighbor in your car. It leaves the streets safer for the children and creates a more family-centered environment that the rest of Europe is starting to experiment.

Maybe your idea of a family centered area is one of spread out houses with private garages and cars but we can also create that by doing away with vehicles and removing them from our environment.

In Paris, vehicles were banned for a period of time because the of smog content in the city. If citizens did not comply to this order they were to be fined and your vehicle could be impounded. The increase use of motorized vehicles by mass pollutes cities and makes it unsafe to breath the air. Hybrids, plug in cars, and vehicles transporting 3 or more people were excused from this sudden crack-down on automobile use, but after a few days the French government allowed it to return to the normal use of all vehicles.

In Bogota, Columbia, no-car days are being experimented with. The citizens have been every enthusiatic in participating and overall it has been a huge opportunity for people to get out and enjoy the city on foot, on bikes, or in buses or taxis. Other cities surrounding Bogota joined in the event this year and also enforced fines upon anyone who did not comply to the rule. Business has boom and overall stress and worry is lowered because of the fresh start people get with biking places instead of driving.
