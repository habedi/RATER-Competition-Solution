Distance learning school does not offer many personal benefits than you think, because there's some difficulties that people can have taking classes from their home. It can be stressful and one reason is: if someone does not understand something, there's nobody to help them answering their questions, another reason is when they have to treat with more people the doesn't know how to treat them, and the last reason is that they have to be responsible with their schedule, starting class time and finish it at time, but sometimes people has more things to do and the schedule can be hard to respect.

People take classes as we take attending the school, some classes are more harder than other classes, if they are strugguling with some topic or lesson they have to look for options that help them to understand as seraching on the internet, watch videos on yotube because they doesn't have more people around them as a teacher or classmates to help them. Having more people around us is always good because sometimes they explain in another way we understand better but people attending classes from home does not have that adventage.

Treating people is another fact that can affected to them, because there's many type of cultures and if they does not have classmates to treat, when they have to be outside, they are going to feel rare, shy or even disrespectful. Sometimes can be in another way, some students prefer to attend school because they like to share with more people but parents prefer that they take everyting from school at home so studens can be really affected, causing that they loose the share feeling and started to be an alone person.

School Online has its own shedule, students has to be responsible with that. Starting class on time is important so they can cover everything for that day and they can finish the class on time. But they does not have just the school responsability, they have more things to do, and if they doesn't have enough time to do everything, they can suffer stress, and stress carries many things with it, like acne, headache, insomnia, etc.

An important fact for life is to have good relation with different kind of people, this is one of the problem for students who attend school online. They does not have as much help as they need, and know how to organize is really important for them. If they does not have the courage for be responsible in any aspect of taking clasess/school online they should think if it is a good idea to do.
