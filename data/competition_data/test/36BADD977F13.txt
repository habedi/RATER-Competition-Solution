Luke thought you would like to go to the Seagoing Cowboys program. You travel around the world. It will be cool to see differnet things. You could help the cowboys the all the animals. I think you will have a great time. Hope you have a great time joining the Seagoing Cowboys!

You ride on a boat to the places you go. The cattle-boat trips are an unbelieveable opportunity. Helping people is good. You take alot of tips and do lot of cool things. Just try it out and se if you like it. There are some roles you play to help people with things. People lost thier things becuase of World War 2.

Finally I think you will have a good time. If I know I like it, you will to. Go and have a great time. Go travel around the world. Go and see things you maybe never saw before. You will have a great experiance. It will change your life.
