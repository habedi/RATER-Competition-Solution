Often time, students will have to stay home from school for various reasons. This can cause them to get behind in their classes. They may get sick and not be able to go to school for one or more days; or, they may not have a way to get to school. Beacuse of staying home, students miss out on lessons and fall behind. If classes were available online this would not be an issue. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because there would be no sick days, they can work at their own pace, and there would be no wasted time.

Online classes would eliminate sick days almost entirely. Most of the time, the only reason students have to stay home from school is to prevent spreading the sickness they obtained. They would be able to safely get work done without having to leave his or her home. Other times, students stay home simply because they couldn't find a way to get to school. It would benefit them greatly if they could acess their classes online, in case they can't physically attend those classes. So, they would not have to miss out on lessons or fall behind.

Another reason students would benefit from attending classes online is that they would be able to work at their own pace. Frequently, students will feel overwhelmed in a classroom because the teacher or professor is teaching at a fast pace. Also, at home, they would be able to go to the restroom, get a drink of water, or something to eat while in a classroom they would not usually be able to do so. In addition, students would be able to listen to music while they work. Silence in a classroom can cause someone to get distracted more easily than they would listening to music.

Lastly, students would benefit from online classes because there is no wasted time. In school, a lot of time is wasted because of study hall or exploratory classes that are not needed. Time can even be wasted in core classes due to finishing work early and having nothing else to do. If a student were to work at home, time could be managed better for them personally. For example, a student could spend more time working on math than history, instead of spending the same amount of time on both. They could also do their work out of order to get assignments they see more important done first. This way, they would not have to wait around for the teacher to give the next assignment or wait for their next class to begin. Although, it is true some students may waste more time at home due to all the distrations, it would still be more benefical to take classes online because the students who waste time at home are the same students who waste time at school.

In conclusion, students would benefit from classes being available online. They would not miss out on anything from staying home and they could work at their own pace. Also, they would not be wasting valulable time. Every year, many students start getting bad grades due to missing new lessons or reviews. Attending classes at home would decrease the amount of students falling behind. Overall, making classes available online would be a very smart decision.
