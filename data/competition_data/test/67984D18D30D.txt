If you were able to take online classes wouldn't you take them. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. Distance learning is a program that allows you to take classes by way of online instead of physically attending a class. Taking online classes has many benefits that contribute to your personal life and also your student life. Online classes allows you to work at your own pace, have more time for yourself, and be able to work without any distractions. I believe that distance learning is a great option for schools to offer students.

Physically attending a class can sometimes be stressful. Teachers only have a certain amount of time to teach you what they have plan for that day and they tend to rush you. But what some teachers don't understand is that everybody doesn't learn at the same speed. It takes some students longer to understand what they are teaching. If you take online classes you wouldn't have to worry about anyone rushing you, because you can work at your own pace.

When you attend a class you really don't have time to take care of yourself, especially if you have multiple classes in one day. When its time to leave school you probably have to go straight home because you have to write an essay or have other homework to do. Also if you play a sport that makes it harder, because you have to balance your life, school, and the sport that you play. With online classes it makes it so mush easier because you can get your work done early in the morning instead of waiting for school to start for you can go to class. Just think about the extra time that you could have.

Having classes with other people can be very distracting. In all your classes there's always going to be someone or something that is keeping you from focusing. At home you don't have to worry about anyone distracting you. With online classes you can do your work peacefully.

More schools should start offering distance learning to students. I believe that students would do better in school if they had online classes. Online classes gives them the chance to work alone and not be distracted by anything. Schools should allow students to choice if they want to take online classes. Everyone doesn't work at the same pace.
