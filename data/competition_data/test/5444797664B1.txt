Dear TEACHER_NAME:

With all of the homework and projects students get today we don't have time for what we want to do, so why should we be wasting our time with community service. I am not saying it is a bad thing I wish I could go help out at the humane society or something but I'm usually up tell nine, ten o'clock doing homework. So students even haft to drop sports because there is a lot of homework. I am one example I have homework tell nine forty-five or ten o'clock. I've also dropped bowling on Mondays because of all of the homework. If you were to add community service to me to do list I wouldn't ever have any tome to spend with family, friends, and pets, I would be doing the community service on my well deserved weekend when all I want to do is sleep, play video game, and most importantly skateboard which I can't do thank to homework. It is crazy how many hours on stuff the school is making us do, please, I ask you not to add community service to the list of things to do, all you will end up with is students not liking you and angry parents because their child was up tell midnight doing homework.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
