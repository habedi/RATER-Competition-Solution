Teachers should allow students to use the phone during free time because it is a good time to use it is not like you are learning anything at the time. It is just free time i could see during class hours but they are not doing like anything.

So that would be the best time to use your phone in like lunch because you just eating and talking to your friends. Students are at lunch or when you done with all you work you should able to use your phone. I do not understand why some many teacher stress over students using there phone during free time. You think that they would just let you after how many students just do it anyways. It would just be so much easer on the teacher if they just let the students use the phone during spare time. That way so many students do not have to do it behind there teacher back . That way the teachers know you not going to be texting during class hours because you get to use it later in that day.

This is why so many students get in trouble for using there phone in school . When the teacher asking why you using your phone during school and you tell them your reason they just sometime do not want to listen to what you have to say. It when be helpful to there students to use them during free time. What if you hat to tell your parents you ha to go to your active or have a meeting after school.

You have to tell them for if they work or need to find you a ride home.

So your parents know what you are doing for they are not wondering what happen to you. That why they know what there kids are doing after school and are safe at all time of the day. That is what i think about using your phones during your spare time of the day because it would just make life easer on everybody and have no worries about students using there phones during spare time of day during school.
