Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I think Community Service is a good idea that students should be involved in.

It is a great idea. It could help everyone in the community live in a better environment.

Also, it could be fun and there could be many activities students would enjoy doing. And it could help the world be a better place.

The students, well some of them think that doing Community Service is a waste of their time. And that they would rather do other things that they enjoy doing.

And that they rather be with theirs friends and hang out. Students would most likely lie so they wont go.

Students could have many enjoyable activities they can do, while doing some of the Community Service things.

it could be a fun thing to do with their friends. Everyone can just hang out and do the Community Service. Students also think it is boring. But they could have a good time being with their friends and peers.

The Community Service program can also help the school. They can have more activities and field trips. Things that could be fun and make students have a good time with their friends. And it could be a fun yet educational school to be at. Once again I thinks this program is a very good idea. Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
