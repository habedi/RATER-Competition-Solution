Would it be amazing if you could read people's emotional expressions? Some people have emotions, but it is very hard to read because of that person. Professor Thomas Huang has came up with "this new software that helps develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate." Do you think it would be a good idea to have this technology which is capable of reading emotional expressions of people especially in a classroom? Yes, it is a great idea because now we can use it to our advantages. This technology can help us humans better students in a classroom because now they can better the students education. In the article it states that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. When you read that, you can realize that this technology is way more advanced then the technology we have now. It can better the students in a classroom because what if the technology can tell that specific teacher that he/she is bored out of their mind and they do not care about the material that the teacher is giving them right now? The teachers could get that students data from that new technology and then come up with a better way to teach the material that is not boring the student out so like playing a game every once in a while. If that teacher does that, the student would be more engaged in class because who wants to sit in a boring classroom for 45 minutes and do nothing fun? NOBODY! In paragraph 6 it states that most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that too says Dr. Huang. As you can see in this generation, people will have a smile on their face throughout the whole day, but are they really that happy in their mind? We as humans can only see the outside emotions of that person, but not on the inside. This technology can help us with that though because what if someone is for example very depressed, but they are smiling. The software could analyze their inside emotions so that for instance that person could get the help they need if that emotion is too dangerous for that person. In this article it states that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Just by this little sentence you can comprehend that "it can reveal so much about the science of emotions!" Just a happy person can reveal how they are feeling inside and out throughout the whole day most likely. This technology is very high tech, but it is worth it. It will probably be a ton of money, but it will pay off in the future because it can help students and/or anyone that is going through an emotional life. This can get students the help they need so that they can be successful in their lives instead of failing their schooling and/or jobs. This might even be the next big thing! Also this will change peoples lives right before our lives because the future is coming and we must be prepared for it because we do not know what it holds for us humans.
