In this article of the " Making Mona Lisa Smile" I wouldnt beable to choose which side to be on with using this technolgy to read students' emotional expressions. Is it good for us to know how other people may feel, or is it invading in our own privacy. Our expressions are key to alot, but does this technlogy work I mean what if someone faked an expression and the technolgy gave us the wrong data back.

This technolgy proves Mona Lisa's expression, " 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry". Do we know that for sure? That she was feeling that way at that time, it is a painting. The artist could easily make a mistake on her face and give the wrong expression. This technolgy can be right, but the exact percentage of the persons feeling, that person doesn't even know that so how can a computer tell us it?.

" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles". There are six emotions this technolgy collects thats happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technolgy can be good for our future to tell us some what of the persons expressions, but I domt beleive it will give you the 100 percent truth in things.

Computers aren't smarter then the human poulation itself I mean we created them. It might be smarter then one human, but not at. Someone can move there face and it doesn't have to be an exact expression. Without this technolgy knowing all expressions how is it going to know are right one. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored; bored maybe, but some people don't show expression to those things. To an expert, " faces dont lie", but humans lie all the time and yes you can tell by there face most of the time. But people get a way with murder, robbing, stealing, all from lying I mean did they tell form there face there were? No, because nothings 100 percent and I believe nothing can be that powerful to come up with those kinds of calculations.

From the short description of my thinkings, you tell me what you thing? I make these faces all the time, but yet doesn't mean im having the expression on what they make. No body should need a computer to tell what your feeling. Ask that person ? Don't let technolgy make up the world. There trying to find a expressions, movments, and etc. all with computers. Robots are being made from us, are world is changing so fast. When is this going to change ? Soon there going to have robotic figures working in businesses or fast food resturants or resturants period. We are left with what ?
