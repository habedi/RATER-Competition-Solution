Millions of kids around the world attend classes at school on a regular basis. A handful of these students struggle in school, including people I know personally.

Students would benefit from having the option to attend classes from home, due to them having busy schedules, health related issues, and desires to be more independent.

Students attend school for 7-8 hours a day, stuck inside classrooms, leaving them with little room for hobbies and extracurricular activities. Taking classes at home would open up more time for work, sports, and other personal events. Sports outside of school often need students available for practice and games. Students with jobs lose working hours from transporting to and from school. Being trapped inside a school building all day limits students creative freedom, and ability to form personal interests. Some students just have busy schedules in general, and cannot lead the lives they want to because of school.

Another cause of students struggling in school is having to deal with health issues. Students with medical conditions such as diabetes have to administer medication for themselves, which can be uncomfortable to do in the middle of a school day. Other medical conditions or injuries can make just physically getting to school hard. Illnesses also cause students to miss school, making them fall far behind in their classes. If classes are normally taken at home, then it would be easier to catch up, or just not fall behind in the first place. Mental health issues are also a large contributor of struggle in students at school. Thousands of teens deal with depression and anxiety, myself included. Being surrounded by tens of other students all day is stressful. In environments like these, it can be hard to concentrate on getting work done. Taking classes at home would allow for students to relax, and feel un-bothered by social pressures surrounding them.

Having the ability to be independent and conscious of one's self at an early age is important. When teens spend all their time in a classroom, it can be difficult to form an identity, and truly figure out who they are. Being surrounded by so many people all the time pressures young teens to be more like everyone else, stripping them of their individuality. Students are bullied and harassed for liking certain things, or dressing in certain ways. By taking classes at home, stress would be reduced, allowing students to focus on their school work, while also focusing on themselves.

Whether it be their busy schedules, health issues, or lack of independence, students should have the option to attend classes from home. I would hope that in the future more schools offer long distance learning, as it would benefit many kids' lives, reducing the overall stress caused by having to attend school.
