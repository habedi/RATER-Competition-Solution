The author belives its worthy that we keep sending people to Venus despite the dangers it presents. In this eassy I would give resonse and explancions as in why the another things we should keep exploroing Venus.

One of the resons the author suggests that we keep studing Venus because its closer to Earth. Sence Venus is closer to Earth the scientists belive that there could be life on Venus. In paragrahp 4 the text states that " long ago, Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like Earth". Now in days scientists say that the planet still has some familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters.

Another reson why the author things we should keep studing Venus is because, he belives that maybe someday Venus cand be our nearest option for planetary visit .The text states that " Futhermore, recall that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time farmes of space travel". This shows that maybe someday the scientists will find a to be able to live in Venus.

Many people are trying to make machines that can last on Venus to help find discover more about it. Acorrding to the artical"NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. For ezample some simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surfawce and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions". They are also looking back at old technology called mechanical computers.

In conclusion this shows that ev even tho it maybe dagers sicentists are still trying to finger out ways to go and explor more abot Venus without so much danger.
