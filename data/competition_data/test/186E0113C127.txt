Phones & Driving

Cell phone usage while driving is one of the most causes of accidents to young teen drivers. In the United States,motor vehicle accidents due to distracted driving is increasing. While most people are aware of the risk of using a cell phone while driving, they still continue to take the risk anyway.. Texting while driving causes a 40 percent increase in accidents because of the time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.

Driving is not something to play around with especially for young drivers. It's responsibility to them and putting trust from their parents/guardian to not be in any big accidents. Because of how much death that have been occurred from the cell phones, they have legally made a law about the use of cellphones. Since then the toll numbers of death especially to young drivers have been dropped. Even though the bars have been drop we still got those kind of people who don't care about the law and still take risk their own lives with texting or being on the web while driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. As each year go by I can see that the government are doing their best to reduce the death toll of car crashes but one more title they soon gotta check up on is the deaths from drunk driving because they are the 2nd most cause of deaths in car crash just from drinking and driving.

Therefore, I believe that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Just recently in 2018 Georgia has just made a law called the "Hands-Free-Law". Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor's Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rule even tapping "play" on a Spotify playlist while not parked, face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second offense. Everything I have discuss result to me disagreeing to having phones while driving.
