Doing projects over the summer can be a hassle and most of the time student dont want to do the work. Most of the time the teacher gives everyone a project to do ,designed by her, but what if instead the were student-designed. This would encourage students to do their work, let them make their own decisions, and showed their teacher what they really know and shows how creative they are .

When someone tells kids to do something most of the time they dont really wanna do it,especially when it comes to school work when they are out of school. But letting students design their own projects encourages them to want to do it more because it's their own idea. This will make it easier for the student to complete their project because it is something they enjoy talking about .When they are having fun doing the project thats when things are done the best.

When making your own decisions you can make a plan for how you want it done and what you are going to do for it. This promotes students making their own decisions on what they want their project to be about and how they will design it. It also, help students in early decision making with what the topic will be on and how they can put the most information in the project. Also ,if they have more then one idea they have to decide which is the best to do it on. They also have the decision of when they want to do it during the summer and a guessÂ of how long it will take them.

If student designed projects it would let them be creative and show their true potential. Student would have to show their creativity while designing what it will look like and how they want it to be presenting it after summer is over. They will have to show their creativity with how neat and the colors they use. Also, staying on topic with the theme and not getting distracted in other things. This will also show how hard they worked on it and the effort put in it.

In conclusion students should be allowed to design their project for over the summer because it will encourage them to do their work, help them with decision making, and let them be creative. This will help on independence as well as many other life skills they may need in the future. Choosing their projects are just the beginning of a long life of decision making.
