Do you ever see the clubs or sport teams walking around the school promoting school events? Do you ever wonder what its like? Sometimes you see the student council walking around the making sure everything is up to date. Or you may see a sport team getting ready for a game. However, it may not be so bad having extracurricular activity, who knows it may be useful, it could help with social skills, find something your passionate about, or with your grades.

Sometimes all you need in life are good social skills. Join a club and try making new friends, you could even try joining a group project. You can also step it up and be a leader of a school project. Or you can try starting your own club. Just listen to the key word and "TRY" something new.

However, if you do consider joining a club, make sure its a club you like. And its okay if it takes you a while to find something your truly passionate about. Its like a baby learning how to walk, it takes them a couple of times, they'll fall, but they shake it off and eventually they'll get their. Also when looking for a club its always good to try art or music, where can express yourself in anyway possible. And its okay if you don't find what your looking for.

And even if you don't want to join an extracurricular activity, at least think about your grades and how it can boost them up. Cause there's a club for everything. For example, if your failing science join a science club so it can at least help understand whats going on. Or a sports team to help boost your physical education grade. Its up to the student and how they feel about their grades.

And therefore, if all students must have an extracurricular activity whether they should or not. It can help with so much, like social skills, for making new friends. Finding something your passionate about, like art or music. Or to boost your grades if your failing any classes. All students should have an extracurricular activity.
