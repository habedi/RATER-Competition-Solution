In the passage the author talks about how venus is really close to earth but humans haven't been there ever due to how dangerous it is. He goes on to say that it is one of the most dangerous plants out there, but they really want to know whats out there. They want to know what it is like there and if there something more out there. Due to the fact that it is so dangerous they can't send a human there to land on the ground, they have come up with an idea about sending a human out there but in a blimp. So normally when they send people into space they land there and are able to step out on the ground and be on the plant but, for venus its a different story. Due to the air and all the chemicals out there we can't land there at all so, they want to send someone out there in a blinp to hover over venus to see whats out there. Venus is one of the most questionable plants due to the fact we have no clue what could be there. NASA is still working on other approaches to study venus. It might take a few years before someone comes up with a way to view venus without having to land on it. These people are willing to do everything it takes to find a way to view venus and find out whats out there. At the end of the passage the author say "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by damgers and doubts but should be expaned to meet the vary edges of imagination and innovation." and i agree we should know whats out there and be able to explore the world to its full life,becasue we never know what might happen next.
