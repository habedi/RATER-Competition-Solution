Dear Principal:

Sports and other activities are essential to a student's life. It helps them develop and have fun. Sports can also have its drawbacks. I agree with you. I think the policy should be changed so that students shouldn't be allowed to play sports unless they have at least a grade B average.

To start off, sports and other activities can take time with the child's studies, causing them to have low grades. In the future the low grades will not help them to have a successful life. The grades that students make in high school can affect their futures, whether they go to college and have a well-paying job or not. Students with a C average should not be allowed to play sports and other activities because they already have a low grade, why keep on going from distracting sports. The students need to concentrate on school and to make better grades. Thirty percent of students say their grades get lower when they're involved in a sport or activity since it distracts them.

Another supporting reason is that sports tend to separate students from more important things, such as doing their homework, studying for tests, and others. This will get them lower than a C average. Students with an average B have proved they can handle these things since their grade is satisfactory. Its also unfair for those students who make an average B who play sports because they work so hard to get those grades to be able to play sports. I have had experiences with that kind of unfairness.

To sum up my thoughts, these all comes down to education. I understand that many students have a grade C average but I think changing the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

Thank you
