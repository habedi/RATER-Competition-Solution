limiting how much the car is used could reduce the green house gas emissions, smog would reduce, and in germany, it will save money.

to begin with, green house gas emissions are produced by cars being used and the carbon dioxide is not leaving the atmosphere. when the sun shines light into earth's atmosphere, the heat from the light rays can not escape the atmosphere because of all the carbon dioxide. this causes problems in the polar regions. due to the increasing temoatures, the ice is melting more and quicker. this causes sea levels to rise and in teh antartica region, animals can not cross the ice fast enough to get to where their food is leaving them stranded to starve. if the usage of cars was reduced, the green house effect wouldn't affect people or animals as much.

In paris , cars are being banned due to too much smog in the area. "after five-days of intensiving smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, chins, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions." it can also make it difficult to breathe.

the sorce "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" talks about how in Vauban, Germany 70 percent of families do not own cars. the cause of this is because of how much it cost to own a car. One has to pay $40,000 with the cost of their house to park in a parking garage. it is cheaper to just pay for public transportation or walk. not only is it cheaper, but it reduces the green house effect.
