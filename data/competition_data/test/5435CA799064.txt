I don't think that the principal should make students have a B average. Its not fair to all students. Sometimes students try their hardest but just fall short of that B. Sometimes students forget to study for that test the night before but do very well in that subject. Its not always easy getting A' s and B' s. Students that love sports but don't do that great in school depend on that C average. Lets say that everybody on the sports team can't seem to have all their grades A' s and B' s. What is the school supposed to do then? Just take away the sports team? Getting a C is right in between all the letter grades. Having a C as the average just makes sense. Getting a B is not in the middle of the grade letters so it should seem that getting a B is above average. Some students have a hard time juggling family things, little brothers or sisters and can't always seem to get all their work done from no fault of theirs. That's not fair to that student.

I'm sure some students take advantage of that C average but most people still try their best and end up with that C on their report card. Are they just supposed to give up on their dreams or hopes? Maybe what they even thought as their career? Or maybe not having it be a B average but maybe students can't have a certain amount of C' s and they can't play. That compromises with the students and also allows students to do their other priorities and still maintain good enough grades that they can be able to play sports. Even some students that like to slack in class still have to try to keep good grades in order to keep that quarterback position.

With this new compromise the school would probably see better grades all around. Even with students that struggle can go in early and help get that too many C' s into a B. Not all a teenager wants to do is study and do homework or go in early for help. They want to be able to hang out with their friends too. This new compromise would also allow students to do it all.
