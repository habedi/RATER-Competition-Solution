Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because there is a lack of the social aspect that you would have in regular classes. There's no clubs or sport for students to join and participate in, and online courses could be detrimental to a students mental health in the long run, something that is already a big issue among teenagers and young adults.

Lack of socialization can lead to a person feeling isolated and lonely. People need people, it's human nature. With online courses there is a serious lack of human contact, something that people need to survive. Taking away that aspect of a regular school setting can limit the life-long bond and friendships that students create with other students. It can hinder the development of social skills that are needed later in life, for college, work, or just basic forms of life; such as going to the grocery store or a coffee shop.

Similarly, there would be no extracurricular events for students to participate in. For some students, school sports are an escape from the world we live in. Or it could be the only form of exercise they get. For many students, they are able to find something they're passionate about in high school sports or clubs Students can work for scholarships for college that way. Likewise, clubs are beneficial for college applications and just for students to overall be involved in something other than school work. Certain clubs can be a support system for students struggling with anything that could be impacting their life.

Mental health is already a big issue with teens and young adults, and the school system plays a big role in that. However, again, online courses can lead to isolation, which can cause students to feel lonely and/or depressed. For students who already struggle with depression and anxiety, these online classes could prevent other people from seeing what they are going through and getting the help they might need. Students who struggle with these health issues most likely won't do the work they need to get done because they already struggle with motivation. In a traditional school setting they would have teachers and peers to encourage them.

With that being said, online courses would be beneficial for those who have major health concerns that prohibit them from actually going to school, Such as if they were in the hospital or had some form of a disability. They can still get the very valuable education they need without ever having to physically go into school.

Online courses would not be beneficial because students wouldn't be able to receive the social skills they need in life, there would be no events for them to participate in, and it could negatively impact their mental health in the long run.
