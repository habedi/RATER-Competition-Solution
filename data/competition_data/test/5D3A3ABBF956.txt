My personal opinion is that a machine like this would be useless in a classroom. Why spend lots of money on a machine, when all it does is read emotions of students. Students dont need a machine to tell them what they are feeling. If a school is going to spend alot of money on a machine that does only 1 thing, then they should be donating money, having really good school lunchs, and very nice field trips. Having a machine that tells emotions, is like having a machine that tells people when to eat.

Humans are cabable of knowing what they are feeling, when they are hungry, when to use the restroom, when to go to bed. The only humans that should have someone telling them when to eat are infants because they dont know what to or think or when to eat. Thats why they wear diappers, they dont know how to use the restroom or when to. But as they get older they learn when to go to the bathroom and where to go. Same with emotions, they learn what the emotion is, and why they feel the way they do.

Schools should save their money, not buy machines that are useless, and use the money for good. Help the poor, get better lunchs, invest in sports programs, maybe create a new program. If a school has money to spend on machines, then they should add on to the school, make it bigger, hire more teachers. If a student is having trouble in a math class, hire a tutor to help them. Give a certain percent of money to families in need at Thanksgiving and Christmas time.
