Dear Mrs. Principal,

I have heard that you are trying to decide between two cell phone policies for the school. I believe that the first cell phone policy, that states students are allowed to bring cell phones to school but they must be turned off during class, is the best choice for the students. In this letter, I will explain to you the advantages of students being allowed to bring cell phones to school. I will also explain why you must trust your students and give them some freedom.

If students could bring their cell phones to school, it would have advantages to the teachers and the students. For example, if a student forgot their homework at their house, they could possibly call a parent and see if the parent could bring the homework to the school. The student would get a better grade on the homework because it wasn't late. Also, the teacher wouldn't have to wait for the student to turn the missing assignment in. Another advantage of students bringing their cell phones to school is that they could use it to plan ahead. Many students, today, have cell phones and are using them constantly. If a student were to use the calendar inside their phone, they could have their phone send them alerts for things such as when a project is due, if they need to study for a test tomorrow, ect. As you can see, students bringing their cell phones to school would have it's advantages for the students and the teachers.

If students brought their cell phones to school, the students would feel more trusted and that they have more freedom. If students feel more trusted, the students would be more likely to act more maturely. The student would feel as if the principal has high standards for them, and when high standards are met, you get more freedom. If the principal gave the students the freedom of using cell phones in school, they would try harder in school to keep their various freedoms, instead of acting immaturely and loosing their freedom of using cell phones in school. If students had more freedom, they would feel more trusted.

As you can see, their are many advantages in letting students bring their cell phones to school. Students would use their cell phone if they forgot their homework or in case of emergency. They could use their cell phones to become more organized. Students would also feel more trusted and live up to higher standards in order to keep their freedom of using cell phones in school. I hope you consider my suggestion.

Sincerely,
