There are many reasons to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only do you get to travel around the world you get to help others who countrie or town that has been detroyed. Many people liked the outcome from their trip and you probably will too. You dont have to do it every year but if you would like to you can. You might be gone from your family for a while.

Can you just picture yourself traveling around and going places that you might only can go one chance out of a lifetime? In the passage in paragraph one it states how Luke felt about going on the trip, "He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime." Would you want to miss out? I sure wouldn't. All you have to do is join the UNRRA.

The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administraction. The only bad thing about the trip is that you still have to work. The article includes some information in paragraph 2 that during the program you have to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Your probably thinking ew,no gross, but this is progress of helping the coutries that have been ruined. Keep in mind that this is a good cause, the animals need comfort too.

Next, the good part about the trip is the unique place you would be going. In paragraph 5 it states, "Luke had made nine trips---the most of any Seagoing Cowboy." That can be one of your goals if you join the program. Not only did Luke and Don and others just travel they also had free time. They played baseball and volleyball games and many more but they also got to explore freely around the countrie they were in.

Also, in paragraph 9 includes, "But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. "I'm grateful for the opportunity" he says. "It made more aware of other people of other countries and their needes." In conclusion, let Luke's inspiring trip be a goal for you to be apart of the UNRRA program.
