To whom it may concern,

My name is STUDENT_NAME

to my opinion i think that policy number 1 is the best choice that you could have chosen because to begin with most kids don't even use their phones at school, next this could be a reward for those hard working kids, lastly even if you take the privilege of having phones at school the students will still bring the phone behind your back.

First of all, most of the kids use their phones at school. Research says that about 75% kids have good grades. this shows that most kids don't really find an usage to having a phone. In my personal experience, having a phone is not going to help me find an answer to a problem at school. Cell phones are for having fun, it would be wrong for you to take our phones away.

Second of all, it would be a reward for those kids that have to work hard just so they can keep their phones. Most parents make a deal with their kids saying that is they get good grades they can keep their phones. so it really is a reward to those kids having time to use their phones at free time.

Lastly, even though you take our phones away we will still use them. most kids do that now because they don't have the freedom to use their phones. It would make me heartbroken to see you take away a privilege that we have. Our phones are our only way to communicate with the world.

In conclusion i think that you should go with policy number 1 because it would be fun to see your students happy all the time rather than have them with a bad attitude. no principal wants to see their students sad. So maybe next time you reconsider any of your rules or policies you may want to think about your students and how your choices might have an impact on their lives.
