I disagree with the principals decision to make all student participate in extracurricular activity. The reasons are that some students have no time for extracurricular activity, it to stressful and it to much money.

Lot of student don't have time for extracurricular activity. Lots students have lot of homework and would not be able to finish it if they have to join a club. Many students have to go home after school take care of their younger sibling while their parents are at work. Some students have a lot of chore to do after school and would not have time if they started attending after school activity. These are three reasons why some students would not have time for extracurricular activity.

After school activities are very stressful for students. Students have to do homework and do work for the club. An example of doing work for a club is practicing drill for your football team. Some student get less hours of sleep because they have to do all their home work after their clubs are finish. Some students get really stress taking to people that they don't now. These are three reason why after school activities is very stressful for students.

Extracurricular activity can cost a lot of money for the families of students. Parents would have to pay for their child's school uniform, gym uniform and now they have to pay supplies for their child's club. An example of this would be gear for sports. Some clubs have fee that are 25 to 50 dollars per person which is a lot of money for parents of twins. Another example of clubs that have fee are the cooking clubs. Some family live very far form the school and that would be a lot of gas money going to and from school every day. These are reason why extracurricular activity costed a lot of money for the families of students.

Time, stress and money and reason why I disagree with the principal's decision to make all students participate in extracurricular activities. I request extracurricular activity should be a choseÂ for students that have time, is not stress to them and is cheap for them.
