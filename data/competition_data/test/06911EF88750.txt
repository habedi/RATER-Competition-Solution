Have you ever wanted to visit alot of unique places aruond the world and see animals like horses or sheep. Well I want to go to Barcelona in Spain. Well if you do then you would want to join the Seagoing Cowboys club because the club has animals, and takes you around the world to see unique places like Eroupe or Greece, and takes you on a cattle boat mayby you can also see dalphins or even sharks (if you could see the sharks.) First, the club has animals. You can feed the animals and pet them a little I infer that animals are nice. Second. For example the trip takes you to China, or Europe, you can aslo mayby buy a suvenire from those places. I infer that travling is fun. Thirdley, the trip is on a cattle boat witch means you may be able to see a dolphin or mayby even a shark. You can also learn how to mayby fish. You can feed the animals, and go to uniqe places, or go for the first time on a cattle boat. Inifer that there are a lot of dolphins. This trip is well for me sounds exiting and I acually want to pet a goat again. This trip can make you have the expirience of a lifetime, so if you like all theese things the you got to sign in to the club!
