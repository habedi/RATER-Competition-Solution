How you ever thought about being home schooled? The thought of being at home, waking up when ever you want, eating when you feel, and staying up as late as you want. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by ways of online or video conferencing. This is not beneficial because you will get real world experience nor will you will you be able to have a school experience.

When you're in school learning, you have a better chance in the real world. By being in a school environment you're developing stability, communication skills, and time management. For example, you're given an speaking assignment that needs to be complete before tomorrow. You can draw up a to do list and write down everything that needs to be done in the days time. While doing this your devolving time management and stability because you're attacking what is needed to be done. As you're doing the research on the assignment you've stumbled across an issue , so you decide to send your teacher an email saying you came across a small problem and need help with the assignment. By you emailing her you're showing good communication skills because if you would've waited or skipped over it till the last minute it shows you have no communication skills because it could have all been avoided if you would have spoken up. While all of this is taking place you building skills that will soon benefit you which probably would not have happen if you were at home learning then in school getting real experience.

Another reason school is more beneficial is the school experiences that help mold you into the person you will become. In school you're able to be hands on and work with other people. By allowing yourself to Indore these things you are building people skills which you will soon need in order to be successful. For instance ,you're in science class and you're assigned to a group to complete a chemical lab. As your group is doing the lab you are able to be hands on and mix chemicals , also you're able to work together with with other people to complete a task. By completing this event you are building up more skills that you may need when your older to complete the job you have. Also it gives you a reason to look at other peoples perspectives if their is a problem or you cannot decide on anything. Developing more skills each year in school is helping mold you and benefit you in the long run.

On the other hand, being at home learning have its benefits such as taking breaks in between times and more time to complete assignments. This gives you a sense of a safety net and lead way to do things you might not get away with in school. You can sleep in till whenever you feel, you just have to complete the work before the deal line. While this seems like living the life this is really hurting you because you are no going through real life experiences. Also you're not developing good skills to help you in the real world because you've been shelter by being in the house learning, rather than in school getting a chance to make mistakes and learn it better ways to do thing and get other peoples point of view to help expand your way of life.

Schools are put in place for students to be able to get a chance to learn and be put in real world situation that in return help them when they are out on their own. Although home schooling is an option i do not think you should take it unless you absolutely need to because you're tanking your experience in learning more effectively. Being in school provide you with ways to better yourself and in the end benefit you.
