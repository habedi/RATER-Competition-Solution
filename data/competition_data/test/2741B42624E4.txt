Dear Principle,

I am a 8th grader in your school and I am writing this letter to tell you that there should be a community service for this school.

It would show that SCHOOL_NAME is a good school.

A lot of people would do the program.

If you had some people that are not the best of students they may change if they are in this.

It would help a lot of people out.

It would give them a chance to get to know more people.

It may even teach them a lessen.

The students should not be required to.

There could be a list so they could sign up.

There would be a couple students that would do the community service.

Even if there is not a lot there would still be people that would want to help out the school of SCHOOL_NAME.

The sign up sheet would be in the office and there are a lot of people that go threw the office.

The teachers could say that it is a good idea and then students would sign up.

Community service is not just help out older people you could have it where the people help out younger people at the elementary.

A lot of people like little children.

They would probably love to work with them.

It would be fun for them.

Or they could clean up garbage that is on the street.

You could have it where they get out of school.

They would love that idea.

I would go and do community service if we had it.

It would help out the town.

It would be fun if my friends were in it.

I am positive people would do it.

It looks good on a college application.

So seniors would do it.

That is why I think community service is a good idea for the school of SCHOOL_NAME.

Thank you,

STUDENT_NAME
