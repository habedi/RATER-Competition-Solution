Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

BuzzMaven Labs, says "(He) came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph." Also, a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text and now she probably lives with that on her shoulders everyday now.

There really isn't much more to say other than drive safely and don't be on your phone! Make good decisions, don't drink and drive or anything like that.
