If cars were limited if there use there could be many advantages that could save humans from polluting the air. The smog in major citys would be cut down or even eraticated. In Sourse 2 they say" Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...". In response too this they banned people from driving to cut down on the pollution of the the air. In sourese 2 they say " Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...". If major citys put limits of car use then they would be able to cut down on the smog of the city and also the pollutants in the air.

Also if the use of cars and other gas run vehicals were cut down on you could also on the greenhouse gas emission. In Sourse 1 it talks about a suburban area in VAUBAN Germany and how they baned the use of cars. In Sourse 1 it states that "Passaenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.". To repel against the greenhouse gas emission VAUBAN got rid of there car usage making there suberbs more walking friendly. I the United States were to follow in the lead of VAUBAN the 50 percent greenhouse emission gases will be cut down.
