Dear, Principal considering the two possible policies that you've given me, I would have to consider that using policy 2 is better because the children don't really need the phones at school because it is a distraction for the student and for his/hers peers. They wouldn't need the phones if the school already supplied itself with phones in each room. Also if they did supply themselves the phones shouldn't be really bad phones, the phones should be simple and enough to reach long distance phones, because not all of the students live essentially close to the school. some may live a few miles out of town, while the town is very close to the other outside of the town. It is also the parent's fault, because some parents spoil their children by giving them smart phones or the newest phones that just came out. From my experiences I've known people that get the newest phone basically whenever they want. It is also the student's fault too, because not all of them have responsibility like some people I know, and this may be true that there are some people that don't learn from their mistakes. I also encountered seeing children younger than me with cell phones, but because they are younger I see the reason that they need them for protection. Most of the children I see with phones are always live in the bad neighborhoods, and I know that there are people that kidnap children. That sort of goes back where when is was talking about the each phone in the room idea, because what if a robbery or etc. was to happened then how would we get out of a situation like that?

If we did have to have phones in the room then i would suggest that we would strictly limit the amount that we use it. please
