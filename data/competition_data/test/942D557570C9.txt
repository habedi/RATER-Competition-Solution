i think its a great idea to change the schools policy. students should be getting 3.0 and higher to play sports and activity's. all schools should change there policy to have a 3.0 grade average.

i know all students like to play sports and activity's at school, but if you have bad grades you should not be accept to play sports or do activity's. if you want to be in sports do good in school and once you go to high school and you have good grades and your really good at a sport people will find you and give you scholarship to go to collage.

Also when you go to collage having good grades and good at a sport you'll get drafted to go pro. Every student that plays a sport want to become pro.

I know allots of students that are really good at sports , but cant play because they got a 2.0 graded average or lower. its not that hard to keep a B average in school all you need to do is do all your work and homework and pay attention in class. I bet you if you guys do this you will stay at a B average or even higher.

well if students keep a average of a C+ they should still be able to play sport and activitys.
