I think using this technology to read other kids emotions isn't a good idea, because some kids like to keep things to themselves. Some are shy and don't want to get noticed. Others just simply don't like people. Yes it could help tell someone if thier confused or bored like that article said, but we all don't share the same emotions. Maybe one at home but in public or allowing someone else to see it won't work for everyone. Yes it could help students in class or in a test, but if teachers and everyone else are going that far to just to tell soneones emotions, then in all honeslty they aren't doing their jobs right. Sometimes telling someones emotions is very hard, but if you are the teacher and you're giving out a lesson and you can't tell if somone is confused by it. Then what can you tell? or even maybe showing another emotion. Like sad, mad, depressed, sick, we've all seen those emotions every single day. We've all been through it too. So to me it's very stupid to make someone go through that just to see what they feel. I strongly disagree with this, and would'nt do it, I say no one should do it. For fun , yeah but in all seriousness it's very controlling and a watse, just tell someones emotion? really. Eeything is already based on machines, now our emotions.
