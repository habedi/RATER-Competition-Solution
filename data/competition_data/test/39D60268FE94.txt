There is a new computer progam software that tell you how are you feeling. The subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting. It tell you if are happy, mad, or sad. This computer progarm software also tell you what percent of each emotion do you have. The software was invented by the Prof. Thomas Huang he is of the Beckman Institude. This institude is for Advanced Sciense at the University of Illionois. He didn't make this computer program alone this was a collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe. He is from Amsterdam University. Thomas Huang and his colleague are experts developing ways for humans and computer to communicate.

This all begins when a computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face. As an example that this work they used a picture of Mona Lisa. In the picture she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. I think this is a really good program because this way you know how are people felling and you could undrestand a little bit more thier emotion. This program according to the Facial Feedback not only expresses your emotion but also may even help produce them. Overall I think this a really good program because even with a picture you camn know how people are feeling and it tells you the exact percent.
