Dear TEACHER_NAME

dying in a hospital bed is my grandpa with a blood clot stuck in his heart and i don't find out until the end of the day because my parents had no way of getting in touch with me, considering i was at school and my phone wasn't aloud to be turned on. So there I am, walking into the hospital seeing my grandfather laying on a bed with all the life sucked out of him. I didn't even get to have my last words with him before he passed away. Therefore i believe that cell phones should be aloud to be turned on during lunch and in between classes because, its a good way of communication in case of emergencies and its also a way of just talking to your friends.

Now imagine, a school of lots of happy kids communicating with all their friends and putting them in the most perfect mood possible all because cell phones are aloud to be used during some part of school hours.

I don't think that having phones out during lunch and in between classes is a big deal at all. I mean, what is the difference. As long as the phones are turned off during class how can it possibly bother anybody? In case of emergencies or with family issues, it can always be useful to be able to check your cell phone for voice mails, missed calls, or text messages.

Also , I think kids should be aloud to communicate with their friends during a part of school incase they want to plan something later, or help each other with a school project or even just to text each other for fun. Now a days technology is so outstanding kids can send and receive messages to each other within 15 seconds! Why not take advantage and use the technology we have now? I don't think that using phones during lunch or between period can honestly make anybody mad at all so make it happen.
