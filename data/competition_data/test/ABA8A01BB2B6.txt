I think facial action coding system should'nt be used in the classroom to read students emotions. most students wouldnt want there there emotions being read its like envading privacy of ones thoughts and of course emotion.

Dr. Huang says that in the classroom the FACS could determine ones emotion of being confused or bored,but wouldnt it also try to read other emotions as well? Thats not exactly fair to the students. You couldnt rely on it working right anyway. If a student is actually upset they could put a smile on ther face and the conmputer would read it as happy.

Another claim what if students refuse to go to school because of the FACS what is the studet wants to be left alone and the teacher could start critizing them for not paying attention or being distracted or bored. That wouldnt exactly help anything for the student emotionally. Although he/she maybe bored or depressed and not really paying attention they could just be having a bad day or week,and FACS is envading there emotions.

I think that FACS should not be used in the classroom but ore like for military purposes. Or they could be used in police investigations, not for stdents in the classroom. If students are confused they should be the ones to make up there mind and ask questions.
