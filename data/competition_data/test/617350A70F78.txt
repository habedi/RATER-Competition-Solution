I strongly believe in students having to obtain a B average.

Students need to realize that school comes before sports because if you do good in school you will go farther in life.

Sports should be a reward not just something you get any ways. Those on the opposing side think that a C average is passing but soon it will be a D average and then some kids will start failing their classes.

Students need to learn how to be responsible.

It is a privilege to be able to play sports and if someone took sports away from me it would push me to do better in school so i could play sports.

A lot of students who are good enough to play college sports won't be able to because of their grades.

Keeping your grades up to a B average could help you in the future when you are old enough to get a job.

A company might be comparing you to someone who has a B average and you have a C average they will most likely pick the B average.

If you keep your grades up to a B average you would have a better chance of getting into college than if you had a C average.

College could help you get a good job in your future and it would give you a good life.

In conclusion having to obtain a B average would push people who want to play sports to get good grades.

Which would lead you to a better life than obtaining a C average.

I agree with the principal that student who want to play sports should have to obtain a B average.
