"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Heidrun Walter; source 1. For many years, people have depended on cars to take them places and allow them to live a normal life. However, the recent decline in driving and car sales has proven that there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage would help reduce the greenhouse effect, would help reduce smog and other low-air pollution, as well as helping promote aspects of the economy which differ from purely car sales and transportation.

To begin with, the greenhouse effect, a large part of which is caused by cars and their emissions, is endangering not only our environments and ecosystems, but also life as we know it. According to source 1 (In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars), passengers car are the cause of 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and also responsible for approximately 50% of emissions in certain parts of the US. Setting restrictions would allow for a decline in emission of greenhouse gases, whcih in turn would better life on Earth. Its effects could be seen all over the world, such as in global warming, rising oceans, etc. Therefore, limiting car usage would have a positive effect, because it would reduce the emission greenhouse gases.

Equally important, the presence of smog, pollution-caused fog, and low-air pollution is also endangering the well-being of humans and other species (health), as well as the well-being of the Earth, so to speak. According to source 2 (Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer), "After Days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."; after setting restrictions for five days, Paris saw an improvement in air quality. We can thus infer that setting restrictions regularly would help reduce the pollution and general smog of the area. Placing restrictions would help promote various means of transportation, such as public transportation, bikes, walking, etc. An example would be the one from source 3 (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota); in this case, a day during which a capital city places restrictions of the use of cars, helps build a campaign, which allows for bike paths, parks,Â  and sport centers to be created and for sidewalks to be repaired. It has also led to restrictions to regulate rush-hour traffic. Clearly, reducing and limiting car usage can not only reduce smog and low-air pollution, but can also help create a more active city.

Finally, limiting car usage may promote different aspects of the economy. According to source 1, the transportation bills (in the US budget) have, in the past, been used, for the most part, for highways. Reducing car usage may allow for certain parts of the US budget to be used for more important and diverse things, such as education, government funding, community life, and many more. Also, limitations on car usage could help conserve resources, allowing people to place their money into different aspects of their lives, like it is explained in source 4. Moreover, the less people can use their cars, the less people will buy cars (source 4: "Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license"). This will help people focus on re-building the conomy. Obviously, there are economic advantages to limiting car usage, such as availability for flexibility in the government budget, conserving money, and the rebuilding of the economy.

To conclude, there are various advantages to limiting car usage; limitations may help improve the economy, will help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and will help reduce the low-air pollution and smog often found in largely populated areas.
