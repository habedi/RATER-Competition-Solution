Dear Principal,

I would like to say that having students perform community service would not be right if they have plans. I think that these students should have the rights to decide on if they want to do it as a after school thing because some students would be busy with plans they want or need to do. Some students might not even do the community service and skip it. So it would be a better idea if you have them choose if the wanted to take there time of day and do community service.

Some of the students might not think of community service as very important and slack on there job on helping the community. If you have them work with elementary school children , they might not even help them or they might give the child the wrong answer just because they have to be stuck there working with that child and not be some where else. I don't think that would be a good idea to have them do that. Some students who would have to work with the litter might even litter them self or not even pick the trash up and hang out with his/her friends. Then there wouldn't be no work done and there would be a bigger mess to clean.

Even if you think about punishing these students for not doing there work, they wont care because they don't want to be there at all. If you make them do extra they just mess it up more. So would you like for the elementary school children to fail because you sent students to help them when they didn't want to at all? Would you want the parents of the elementary school children to be mad about what your students or teaching them? Do you want the parks or fields where these students have to pick up litter be even more a mess? Do you want these kids to make your community an undesirable place to be?

-Your Student
