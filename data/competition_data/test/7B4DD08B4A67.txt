Stress, work, jobs and injuries. Some students have all of that on their shoulders: responsibilities that they need to take care of in, and outside of school. Students can't always focus on academic studies, or activities. They have other things to do, like babysitting a child, working a job, healing themselves physically and mentally. Therefore, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students, just like some adults, have things they need to do after their 'job' is over. These things include working a job, picking up a sibling from school, or running errands for their guardians. And even if students didn't have anything thing to do after the last bell of the day rings, they shouldn't have to stay long. It should be the students choice to what they want to do, whether it's just to go home and relax, or go out with friends. School generally limits our free time and social time. Therefore, students shouldn't be force to limit their seven to eight, or more, hours of time they have to do what they want.

Besides not having time to do what students want, there's stress. Stress is like a child kicking over an anthill. It takes students long to become stress free, and stress randomly comes at times. Whether that random stress is studying for a test or class, worrying about keeping up grades, and doing homework on time. So the last thing a student needs is a child, stress, destroying their anthill. Basically what I'm saying is that requiring students participation in extracurricular activities will overflow students with stress, and eventually, they might become too overwhelmed. The mind is a fragile thing, and should be taken care of with care, just like the body. Students can't do certain activities if their body is injured. And for the some activities that they can do, the student just may want to heal fully instead of jumping back into school and receiving more stress. With that, students should decide what they want to do.

Extracurricular activities will benefit students, that is what some people may say. While I do agree some extracurricular activities will benefit students who choose to be apart of it, it may not do good for others. What good would it do for you to be apart of something that your hearts not in? Yes, it's nice to experience new things, but some experiences aren't for some people. Besides that, students have a life outside of school. They can't be expected to have school as their only responsibility. They have things that need to be done, and things they want to do. With that in mind, the students who want to be apart of after school activities should, and those who don't shouldn't have too.

Opportunities are a great thing for students, but those opportunities shouldn't be required of students to take them without any choice at all. Students have tons of responsibilities they need to attend to either way. Therefore, more stress is unneeded in the long run. In conclusion, students have a lot to stress about, free time they want, injuries to heal, jobs to be worked. So please consider the idea that students shouldn't be forced into doing extracurricular activities when it could hinder them.
