Dear principal,

I feel students or even adult should have to do some sort of community service at some point in there life. Even though I feel it should happen, I don't think it should be necessary. By making the decision to have a form of community service, not optional is pressuring to the students at the school.

When you attend school, it should be fun for the most part. Maybe some students just want to go and get the day over. Others might be very involved with the after school activities or functions. By making community service something they have to do in that school for a grade or something like that is not fair. The person that chooses not to stay after school may have something already filled in that time spot, and cannot attend that function for that day.

Another good example why this student cannot attend is because it cost money that the family needs for something else. Maybe they have to live paycheck to paycheck. This problem could be solved but, it might be a little difficult for the school. The school could maybe not have anything cost money. Yes community service is mainly volunteer work but what if you need to buy a t-shirt for the events? Also what if you buy a shirt but you can no longer fit into the shirt because you have a growth spurt? If you had to be apart of that group you would eventually have to pay for another shirt. Most likely this shirt will be the kind that you only wear when you go to the events and no where else. This will mean that you now just spent money on these two shirts that you will never ever wear again in you lifetime.

This is why I feel that you should make community service optional for students in your school.

Sincerely,
