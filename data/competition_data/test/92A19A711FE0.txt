Today there is a big problem in the world and that problem is car emissions. This has been becoming a growing problem around the world. In Paris a thick layer of smog had covered the city and its government had to take action. the government practically shutdown road traffic by telling the people with even plate numbers to not drive and the next day telling the people with odd plate numbers to not drive.

Many of the problems that create this are the densely populated areas with high car usage. In Europe in 2006 there government finished construction on a town that had no garages or drive ways, the only place to park was a garage that you had to buy a spot in for $40,000 witch you payed for along with your house. This trend has been growing around the world, and with this trend spreading so is lower pollution in the world.
