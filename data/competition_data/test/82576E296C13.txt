I think being a Seagoing

Cowboy seems like fun yeah, maybe you do have to do work but you can have fun while doing it. From

Lukes experiance

I would probably go and try it. So

Luke is kind of persuading me to do it so I am persuading you to do it now.

One reason I think that Seagoing Cowboys isn't just about the work is because while the animals are unloaded then you are returning home you get to play gameslike volleyball, baseball,fencing, boxing, and a lot of other older, cool games."But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger."(paragraph 9). To Luke it was more than just alittle adventure with his friend it was something that opened up the world to him."It made me more aware of people of the other countries and their needs" And that awarenedd stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years."

To Luke it wasn't an adventure it was an new oppotunity for him that could be for you too. Everyone get new opportunitys everday.
