School causes anxiety and stress on many students today. Schools that offer distance learning as an option to students are very beneficial because, one on one instruction, better time management and dependency skills, and it makes a comfortable working environment for students.

At times school instruction can be very difficult to understand when you are surrounded by people who are your peers and distract or make you nervous. That leads to students not reaching their full potential in class when they are constantly distracted. There are always times when the teacher is explaining vital information and a student is talking. Distance and online learning offers easy accessible one on one instruction so that students can reach their full potential and not be distracted by other students in the class. When students are being loud and distracting in the classroom it can be hard for students to take in information and have success. Students vary and have different learning styles. Online schooling can help you find an instructor that fits your learning style you will more easily understand the education and knowledge you are receiving.

A lot of students have other activities that keep them occupied sometimes before and after school. School getting in the way of that can have a very negative effect on students by leading them to not be able to focus in school or having to drop that activity. Online schooling and video chatting can help a student improve and obtain great time management skills. Most school days being seven to eight hours long leave students with time after school to either do schoolwork or something like a sport or a hobby. This leads them to go and do their sport or hobby and come to home to pages and pages of schoolwork. Students usually stay up all through the night to complete the work so they will be prepared for their class the next day. Some schools can start as early as 7:30 in the United States so staying up very late and doing work will give students no energy the next day and can have an effect on the quality on a students work. Many students who want to pursue both find that it is very difficult to balance the two and succeed in both. Online schooling allows students to have more time and energy to pursue their interests. Schooling and video conferences online will most likely not take 7 hours; so students can have success in their education and also do what they want to do. This will also teach them dependency skills. Students who take online courses are not in a class room surrounded by peers and other students so they must learn to depend on and motivate their selves to achieve success.
