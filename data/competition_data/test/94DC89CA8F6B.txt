Dear, Principle

My reason why I am writing this letter is because many people want to participate in sports but they have a C's and want participate in the sports but they can't because of their grade. Many students are complaining about not letting them play in a sport. They want to improve their grade and try their best to get at least get a B's. If they had at least the B's they would get in the sport they want to get in. Some students try their best but cant reach their goals of getting a better grade. They say that it is to hard. I think that they should leave the students focus on their grade and leave them play for one week and the other week study to try there best and reach their goals. If u let them join in the sport that they really want probably they could hire there grade. They might also give you more reasons why they would want to play in a sport.

Another reason why you should let students play in sports is because it is healthy for your body and also good because u can focus to being a better student instead of being in other places not learn

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
