The land form found on mars was most surrley created by natural land. It states in paragraph 3 it says "huge rock formation...wich resembles a human head...formed by shadows." It was an illusion created by the shadows wich make it look like thers all the fetures of a human head. But some people disagree and think that was aleins that made the head, but they didnt have claims or evedence that aliens are the ones who did it.

In paragraph 5 it says that the "Face on Mars" has since became a popular icon. It also states that some people think that it is boneified evedince of life on mars, but how can the bones or remains of these so called "Aliens" have suvived all those years it would have deteriated away by now.

A few scientists think that is was created by alein. Even know in the begining of the artical it talked about how it was just a shadowy illusion that made you think that is was human head. But now there saying that it might of acuttaly been created by aleins.

The scienstists are right because in the artical it rarely has evedence of aleins being the ones who caused this. Also the scientis have all the evedence and claims and facyts to clariffy that aleins didnt do it. It was just natural causes and illusions.
