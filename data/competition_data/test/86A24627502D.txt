Dear principal,

I don't think its fair to make the policy a c average to do sports. Not many kids can get A' s and B' s.

Many kids would not like the fact that you might change that but, its also unfair cause some kids are smart then others and they would b able to do sports and then kind a smart kids with the A' s, B' s ,and C' s wouldn't b able to do a sport. I think many parents would be angry too, because they like to go watch their child or children do their sport that they love. There are many reasons why you shouldn't take the policy to B average. Especially because kids wont be getting their exercise they need and if they have the sport to keep them active then you should not change the policy. A lot of the kids is SCHOOL_NAME does sports, and I'm sure they all enjoy doing the sport that they do. Then if you take the sports away from the children some wont get exercise and some will turn obese and that's what SCHOOL_NAME is all about. Making sure the students are healthy and normal weight, and ever student gets the right amount of exercise they need. So that's my reason why you shouldn't make the policy at least a C average to do a sport.

Sincerely, A SCHOOL_NAME Student.
