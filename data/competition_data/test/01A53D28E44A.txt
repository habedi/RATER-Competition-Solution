Dear Principal,

I think having cell phones are not beneficial because it distracts kids minds from what the real communication is in reality and that's face to face. Many kids get distracted from schoolwork or very important things and blow it off just because they want to text someone.

Kids keep getting in trouble in school for texting in class so why not ban the? It also keeps teens away from educational purposes like texting instead of reading.

Moreover, I believe it brainwashes the teens to be less active or energized. It also leads to cyber bullying and many other consequences. The most important thing of all is that it keeps them away from their future. Education is everything in our future. It is our water in our plants and is the roar of a lion. If success is what you are planning towards these teens, then you must take away their privilege of using cell phones on school grounds. They will soon realize its for their own good and will starting running towards a successful future.

Many say that it is a way of communication, but talking twenty four hours a day is a waste of time and its a waste of success. I know you have your freedom, but I suggest to think of the future and where these teens are going to end up as. We want America to be a proud and successful nation, so why not start small with minor problems with too much use of cell phones.

In conclusion, I believe to a better start in a united is to make the next generation successful. You will soon agree how these kids will change in a more mature and mannered citizens they turn out to be. One little thing can do a lot. So, teens should not be able to use cell phones at school.
