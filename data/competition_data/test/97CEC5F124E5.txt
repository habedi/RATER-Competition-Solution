The matter of schools offering online education from home is a widely controversial topic. There are many pros and cons to each option that parents and students may overlook. The difference between distance schooling and on site schooling could change one's future in many ways. Although some may believe it is more beneficial to take online courses from home, on site schooling helps students to develop better social skills and understand material more efficiently than from home all to help develop life skills that cannot be achieved online.

Throughout life, social skills become a big part of the way one operates in reality. Some may say distance classes will help to shield students from factors such as bullying and danger, but they can also take away from the many joys of school such as sports, clubs, and other activities. A student who participates in sports and clubs learns cooperative skills that can be useful in many careers ,where as one who does not may not be such a team player. By preventing students from experiencing these social factors it harms the way they may approach society. Without social skills, kids may become more shy and introverted rather than being more witty and outgoing. For example, a kid who attends a school dance and is apart of clubs or a sports team may become more social than one who stays at home doing nothing. Social skills help to shape ones character and taking that away would not be beneficial to these students or society.

As well as social skills, work efficiency is another big part of the world today. Many may argue that a classroom environment is stressful to students who may learn at a slower pace than others. By taking away personal face to face instruction, it could be seen as eliminating a stress factor in schooling, however, having teachers and peers surrounding each other helps students to push themselves to become better workers. One time I had to stay home from school because I was sick and when I was doing my homework I had questions that I had no one to ask. At home one cannot ask questions or get hands on help from a teacher or other student. Having the help you need in a school environment helps students to become better educated and understanding.

These skills help a person to develop character and personality. One's character can reflect who they will be in the world and what they may do. Life has many obstacles in it but through learning different tools and skills in a classroom life can be effortless. There are milestones that help students to find who they are such as graduating elementary school, taking classes on arts and sciences, team sports and many more. People learn from themselves and others mistakes. Distance schooling keeps kids away from these opportunities to live and learn. On site schooling helps students to develop the knowledge they need to live in the world.

These factors and many more help students to become team players in the world. On site schooling gives students life lessons that can't be taught behind a computer. Along with these lessons are life long memories that give a person character that you can't get behind a computer. Classroom learning is more beneficial to students than distance schooling. Online schooling may seem more efficient to some but learning in a classroom helps to develop well rounded students with good life skills.
