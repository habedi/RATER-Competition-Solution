Some students love to do extra things in life like sports or things dealing with school like yearbook or student council. But there are cons that needs be brought into light about these extracurricular activities. The principle want his students to achieve in extra activities that they like, but this goal can effect his students in many different ways. Some kids might find extracurricular activities fun while others dont, so the cons about having extra activities are more work, less family time, and very exhausting.

The first problem about these activities are that some students might not get enough sleep. If a student signs up for yearbook or student council then it causes them to stay up for a extended amount of time. Its not healthy for a student to stay up late because when its time for school then they might fall asleep in one of their classes, and they could miss out on important notes and guidelines.

Secondly, extra activities can take away family time. Family time is very important because you might not want to miss out on great things. If a students main focus is on running for student council or any sports they like then family wouldnt be the main concern. Since these students are being told to do these activities it might not affect many others in the same way because not every student wants to sign up for something. A good outcome of a student working on something dealing with a school activity is that there family can be included to help them out.

Finally, The last concern is that students will have extra work. It would be difficult because teachers already give students loads of school work they want to be accomplished. So, since there is lots of work bring given out, extracurricular activities can add lots of stress onto students because they are going to want all their work finished.

Students should be able to do whatever they want because not every student is good at sports or making detailed essays for student council. So, students should be able to choose if they want to be apart in any act of the schools activities because if they are not getting enough sleep, enough family time, and getting extra work then these activities should only be offered to the ones that want to do sports and many other things, instead of making it mandatory. Also, everyone might not want to participate in a extracurricular activity because they might not have what they enjoy to do available.
