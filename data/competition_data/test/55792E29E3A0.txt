For me, I think it's crazy riduclous how the science nerds have the talent or so creative to invinte something like that (facial human emtion technology)FHET.

I claim , well i'm in between of agreeing with the new technology, but i'm also denying with it. So i'm in the middle! Why? Well for me I say " Who cares what Mona Lisa emtional face". It's already in the past. The past is history! According to the new technology. I think it's a great idea to use it in school, work, kids, and other so that way we can help and cummunicate with others. Meanwhile I just found out that muscles called orbicularis oculi, I just wanted to throw that out. Perhaps Mona Lisa is very important to others. But I think we should use the new technolgy in improve it even more in the future. Atleast according to some new computor software that can recognize emotions. By the way, did making a happy face in this experiment also made me feel slighhtly happy? Well, I guess yeah! I think it's funny how i never knew all about this. I haven't watched the news like years. It's diffenetly great that to know all this new stuff, because that way you know what is going on right now in the real world. " The world doesn't wait for you, you have to keep moving on ."
