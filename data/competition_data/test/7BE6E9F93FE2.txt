So, the principle said that we have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity and if you think about it, it's actually not a bad idea. You see, a lot of us are already doing extracurricular activities such as football or SCA. Now if your not doing an extracurricular activity or never have, it may seem difficult but just think of all the opportunities that can come with doing one. You can find new interests of yours that you might have never even thought about doing, you can make new friends and find people that are also interested in what you are interested in, and you can overall just be more active whether its playing a sport or just not sitting at home all day wasting time. I agree with the principles decision to have all students to participate in at least one extra curricular activity.

If you have no idea in what you would like to do, then your going to have to do some searching. Think of things you enjoy like if you enjoy playing a certain sport or if you like riding a bike. If your not into that sorta thing, than maybe look into stuff like Student Council Association or National Honers Society. In those,activities you can help the school and help your community. Maybe you'll find out new things and interests that you had never thought of ever pursuing in. They'll help you in and out of school and keep you focused on good things.

When you start these activities, you'll meet new people. You'll meet people that are also interested in the activities that your interested in. Lets say you play basketball, you'll meet new teammates or if you join a club, you'll meet others in that club. I love playing basketball so I am on a team. I also love helping my school and others so I also joined the NJHS "National Juniors Honers Society". Since I joined these activities, I met so many people that I never would have if I didn't take the step to start something new. So if you want to meet new people, starting a new activity is a great way in doing so.

Doing all these things make you more active like when you start a sport, you'll be more physically active or when you join a club, you'll be more socially active.

Doing any of these things is making you more active which is good for you and your personality. Being more active will make you feel good physically and about yourself as a person. Being more active is good so you don't just stay at home all day wasting your time playing video games or doing nothing. The energy you give off to people will be different and different in a good way. If you give off good energy, people will also start giving out better energy and everyone will feel better.

So all these things can happen just from joining an extracurricular activity. Just by you making a small change can trigger an effect that makes you and everyone around you feel better. You'll make new friends and you'll find new interests. You'll be more active in and out of school and wont have to worry about being bored when you get home. You can always start something new and exciting and that is whats great about this idea. I think that the principles decision for everyone to start an extracurricular activity is a great idea and I think we should all support it.
