In "The Challenge of Exploring venus,"the author suggests that studing venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present"because venus was probably covered largely with oceans and cloud have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

The National Aeronautics and space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms , a velicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.

Therefore striving to meet the challlenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
