Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is a great help to our society and not enough people do it. Some people think that community service takes up to much time in the day so they might not be able to do more fun things such as play sports or associate with friends. Although this may be true, community service is an ecstatic deed that everyone can do to serve our community. All in all, our school should be required to have our students do community service, and here's why.

Community service includes things such as helping the elderly, tutoring children, and even picking up litter. These may sound like tedious deeds, but where would the world be without people doing these things? We would all be rolling around in our own filth and our education would suffer from lack of mentors. Although they may be a pain to do, our school needs to try our hardest to get it done for our community.

Studies show that only 24% of people who know what community service is have actually performed an act of it. That leaves 76% of people who have not. Eventually, those numbers will come back to haunt us unless we do something about it. What we need to do is make our students perform community service. It doesn't have to be a lot, but something as simple as picking up trash around the campus or even helping a younger child get an A on a test. Whatever the deed may be, it will be helpful.

Another reason our school should make it mandatory to perform community service is that not enough students exercise. This may sound very cliche, but community service can also be a part of a physical education class, that way they are helping their community and they are benefiting from exercise. If we are to do this, it should not be a semester long thing, but maybe a week long unit of all the students chipping in to help better their community. And maybe our school could also start a club or group for the children who want to continue to better their community. Not only that, but it would also count as an extracurricular activity, which would help students in college and beyond.

If our school were to form a club or group for this, then many students would probably be associated with that club and that would spark others to join thereby creating a chain reaction of community service. If we can do that, then these children might continue it into the next generations and continue the chain of community service and help make the world a better place.

All in all, our school should defiantly consider making community service a necessary thing for our students. If we do this then it will help to make our community a better place, which is what we want for it. We can add community service into our physical education classes or maybe any other class, but in some way, shape, or form, we need to have community service in our school. So if you can please consider my thoughts and also consider adding community service then it would be much obliged. Thank you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
