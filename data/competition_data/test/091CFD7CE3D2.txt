The advantages of not using a car are less polution, less laziness, and less gasoline usage. The less gasoline usage would help our society pay less for when we use our cars, the less lazy we get, we can have a smaller overweight citizen count in the U.S.A, and the less polution we have, we can make the world look better.

The first advantage I spoke about was less polution. the less polution we have les more wildlife we could be getting. Also think about all the wildlife we are killing with the polution from our cars. If we can all take one day in our community to leave our cars at home, Im sure the wildlife will be able to live another day without suffocating on poisoness fumes from gasoline or oil.

The second advantage would be people getting less lazy. If we all didnt use our cars for just one day we could all be a little bit of a less fat country. If every American took one day to NOT ride a car we could be in a little better shape.

Finally, We would use a lot less gasoline if we stoped using cars for a day. We could save a butt-load of money if we didnt use cars for a day. Think about how much money you spend, just to drive somewhere you are just going to spend more money! OR you could walk. Save gas, money, and get a workout at the same time. Also think about the tourists. What if we didnt buy gas so much, the price went down to 90 cents a gallon. Then the tourists would get to save money and still get through to where they need to go.

In Conclusion, Less polution, Less Laziness, and Less Gasoline usage are all the advantages of not driving for a day or two. What would your advantages be?
