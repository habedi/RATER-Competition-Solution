I don't think all students should perform community service unless they want to or got in trouble and got a detention I.S.S or any of that stuff. Because if they were bad after those days of suspension they should help the janitors out clean up the cafeteria go around the school and pick up the trash. Now if they had detention they could just do it during the time they had detention. But if they volunteered they shouldn't have to do all the really bad stuff and they should be able to leave and go back to class when ever they would feel like. So yeah i don't think students should have to perform community service unless it is by choice or they got in trouble. Now isn't that reasonable i think it is, so if your going to do community service think about what i said thanks. But if you don't think about what I said or barely look at it then you made a mistake because i think this is a good idea if your going to bring community service into this school.
