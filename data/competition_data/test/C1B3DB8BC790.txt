Being a seacowboy is amazing! I have been on nine trips and, it is the experience of a lifetime! We go around the world in ships taking care of the animals that are being shiped to other countries.

You will be given all the things you need, you just have to feed the animals and give them water, also sometimes clean the pens. The administaration you will be working for is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration but, we usualy call it the UNRRA for short.

At this point you might be thinking why should I even join, it sounds like you do not have any fun? You do not just work all of the time you get to go sight seeing too. I saw things like the Acropolis in Greece, and took a gondala ride in Venice Italy where the streets are made of water! I toured an excavated castle and the Panama Canal also!

After the animals are off the ship and you are returning you get to have fun then too! We did things like baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been kept. We also had table tennis tournaments! Sometimes we did fencing, boxing, and other games to pass the time. If you want to just relax we did things like reading and whittling.

I joined the sea cowboys and I loved it. I think you will too! This opportunity will not come again! So join now.
