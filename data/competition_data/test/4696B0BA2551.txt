Being a Seagoing Cowboy is good in may ways. It is an opportunity of a lifetime. I was able to exprince new things, play games, and help out families.

I was able to exprince things that I could never see. When we were on our way to China, they stopped to let us excavated caslte in Crete. Also, on our way they let us stop to ride in a Venice in Italy. I could have never image that. The people on the ship did something very special for us. They let me see Acropolis in Greece. Not only did I see new things, I got to go to Italy, Greece, Crete, and Chine. Four countries in two weeks.

When we made it to China we were able to relax. I was able to play Volleybal, fencing, baseball, and boxing. Before we left we had a Table Tennis tournament. When I was done play, I sat down and had a silent moment of reading. This things help the time pass bye.

Through all of this I was able to help out familes. I help out the familes by taking care of the animals. So that they don't have to worry about it. It makes me feel good that I am helpping people out.

In conclusion, I would no trade this job for nothing. Even though I broke one of my ribs. It is all worth it in the long run. I have made new friends. It is an opportunity that I wouldn't take for grandted.
