If your principal decided you had to participate in one after school activity would you agree to it? I would not agree to that because there are many reasons why kids can't do that or they may just not want to. Some reasons for this is they may have little siblings to watch after school, they may have social anxiety, or they may have a job to help support their family.

Many children that go to school have to go home after school to watch their little sibling. As a result of this they may not be able to participate in any after school activities. Many children have to go home and watch their sibling while their parents are not there because they may not have been able to get a babysitter or afford it. Many parents probably rely on their children to come home and watch the kids but if the principal made them participate in an after school activity they wouldn't be able to go home and babysit.

Another reason a child wouldn't want to go is because they might have social anxiety. Social anxiety may keep them from wanting to talk to new people, or be in large, crowded areas. They already have to come to school for seven hours a day, after school they most likely would want to come home and get away from so many people. However it may be good for them to get out of their comfort zone. But it may also make things worse if you make someone talk to people when they are uncomfortable.

On the other hand many kids parents might not have a lot of money and they may need to help their parents with money. These kids might need to get an after school job. Although they might not be able to do so if they are required to participate in an after schoolÂ activity. After going to school all day most children have something they have to do when they get home. This does not allow them to participate in an after school activity.

Although there are many reasons why many kids can't participate in after school activities many children can. There are also many reasons why they would be able to participate. However this should not be a requirement because many children can't participate or they simply do not want to. What do you think they should do?
