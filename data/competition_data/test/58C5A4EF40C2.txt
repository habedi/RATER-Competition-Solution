In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggest that Venus is worhty of being studied despite the dangers that it presents. Us humans have landed on the Moon and sent and leanded rovers on Mars why not try and land a rover on Venus. The author does a good job of supporting his/her claim that we should go to and study Venus more, by talking about how it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, sending blimp-like vehicles to hover above the surface, and testing that NASA has done.

Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the article the author states "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." the author says in paragraph 4 is "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." the authors means that since Venus has all of these terrains that are similar to Earth that it may have had liquid water on the surface and the right temperatures to support life.

In the next paragrphs the author talks about imagining sending a blimp-like vehicle to venus to hover around 30 miles above the surface like how our jet planes fly at a higher altitude to avoid flying in storms. towards the end of paragraph 5 it states that the "temperautres would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth." This shows that if we use the right materials we could fly the blimp-like aircraft and study how the air pressure is and the exact degrees the atmosphere would be.

Lastly, the author explains on how the testing that NASA has done. In the text the author says "NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus... some simplified electronicsmade of silicon carbide have been tested.. simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." this shows that the author is getting information from a reliable source (NASA). The author also dives deeper and talks about how another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and that they can resist physical conditions better than modern computers.

In conlusion, the author did a great job saying that Venus is worthy of studying even though the dangers that it presents to us.

he/her supported their idea well with reasons like, how Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system saying that earlier in Venus's lifetime that it was probably covered in water and supported various lifeforms. Another reason was to imagine sending a blimp-like spacecraft to hover 30 miles above the surface o Venus, and , Lastly the test that NASA has been doing to spacecrafts to withstand Venus's surface for at least three weeks. This are good reasons to back up the claim that the author has made.
