Dear principal,

I think it is a wonderful idea to have all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to have to do community service. There are a lot of things we could do to help our community out. We could go around the city and city parks to pick up trash that nasty and lazy people didn't put in the trash can. We could have a babysitting service for single parents who cannot afford to pay for daycare or a babysitter. We could have a club were we go around to old homes and take the old people to places like the zoo or the movies.

You can also use community service as something you have to have an amount of hours to past middle school. Instead of just high school. I believe that if we all take a part of community service we would have less drama on the streets. We could have teams were kids that need help(special ed) could come and have fun without having mean people make fun of them. Every once in a while we could have a game were the money we raise goes to a type of sickness that they are trying to find a cure for.

If we all come together we could come up with a lot of ways to improve the community that involves with helping the community. Some people don't know that if you help the community out every once in a while you fell good inside. If some of these people fell good inside there wouldn't be as much killing as there is. that would be an awesome thing. So I really think that community service should be required.
