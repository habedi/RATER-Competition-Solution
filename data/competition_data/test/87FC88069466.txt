I believe that the use of driverless cars is a decent idea, although it does have it's downsides. The idea of drivers and passengers not having to drive themselves would provide a luxury feel to most participants in the driverless car "movement." This could also help with very common safety issues: texting while driving, intoxicated while driving, or just flat out not paying attention.

In paragraph 10, we see that not only is the driverless car and idea, it's happening. If these manufacturers are still running on track, then we should start to see the sprout of driverless cars this year. This implys that people need to start thinking and making decisions on whether they want to sit back and let a computer do the work or not. While I can see the problem of boredom, stated in paragraph 8, I think that this would empower the driver more. He/she would be able to kick and and enjoy the ride without paying 100 percent of their undivided attention to the road. Long trips and vacations would be made much easier with this, or even for truck drivers who drive late at night.

The United States has been exposed to a large amount of deaths from texting while driving, this could be the end of that. While they would still need to pay slight attention to the warning signals given that they need to grab the wheel, if the driver picked up his/her phone while a computer drove them around, it wouldn't be too bad. Another issue imposed on drivers is being intoxicated and driving. This would also be solved with a driverless car. The driver wouldn't pose a danger to themselves or the passengers in the vehicle if being almost chauffered around. This however could still be an issue if the car needed the driver to take control.

I believe that a driverless car would most definitely benefit drivers everywhere. It could solve many issues that stand due to full attention driving and would cut the death rate from car accidents by a large chunk.
