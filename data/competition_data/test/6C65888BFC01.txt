"The Challenge of exploring venus" it talks about space administration and the national aeronautics (NASA) they talk about tecnical use and the things that go on in space. the authors is studying about things that are good and bad up there he seaches and sees what goes on up there in pharagraph 3 he talks about how atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus is more challangeing are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere.

the planet surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet . venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system even erupting volcanone, powerful earth quakes and frequent lighting strikes. temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenhket. solar power would be plenttiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels. not easy conditions.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus, some simplfied electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus surface and lasted for last weeks in such conditions venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth these differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars our other times to venus. venus is someties right around the corner a thick atmosphere of almot 97 percent carbon dixoide blankets venus temtures. these conitions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth.
