Most students enjoy participating in extracurricular activities, whether they are joining a club, joining a sports team, or helping out around the school, because these students are doing what they like to do on a daily basis. Even though most students are taking part in these activities and enjoying them, there are some students that are locked up tight and don't want to do anything because they are shy and nervous. Extracurricular activities are beneficial to students, because they can make new friends, expand their hobby interests and follow them, or improve socialization skills.

First, joining a club or sport team is a good way to find new friend groups, or a single friend. Even though most students already have more than enough friends, some students are trying very hard to make some more friends. Joining a club or sport team can help these students achieve their goal. If students join an activity with different student that they don't know, then some of those students could have some of the same interests, and have a lot in common. Discovering that they have a lot in common, and having similar hobbies, will lead to new friendships that go together like animals and food, you can't have one without the other.

Also, a new club is a good way to expand students' hobby interests. All students must enjoy doing something, whether it is reading a nice book in a chair that is soft as air, or helping a teacher with work in their classroom. If a student is interested in one single activity, that doesn't make them very enjoyable to be around, because all they want to do is the same thing. But, if they join an extracurricular activity, that student can get references to a new club or sport that they also might enjoy if they try it. It is good to have more than one activity that someone likes to participate in.

Finally, socialization skills are a key part of any student's day, so joining a club is a good way to work with those skills. If the club that the student joins requires community service, then a student would need to have the essential skills of being in public in order to take part in the activity. Some schools also include an event at the end of the school year that involves talking to a high level employee of a profession, like a mock interview. If a student has a goal set for their future employment and profession, then they would learn from the mock interviews the skills that are required to achieve that goal.

In conclusion, it is good for students to make the choice to participate in an extracurricular activity. When these students are deciding which activity to participate in, they should think about what kind of friends they could possibly make in that club or sport, what could branch off of that one activity to interest them more, and how it would improve their skill of socializing and being in public. Extracurricular activities are good for any student, whether they are shy and nervous, or social and looking for more friends.
