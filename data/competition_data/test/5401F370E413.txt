The author really does support the idea of studying Venus that way they will find new things they didn't knew about Venus. Also, he supports that idea because they have being searching things about Venus and making the NASA to make them study about it. It can be the time to know everything and making changes. The reason why I think he supports the idea of studying is because he mention things that he was learining but doesn't know the answer to it. He said that they always go in differents speeds it means we get close to Mars and sometimes they one who is closer is

Venus. For example in the text it says

"Venus is the second planet from he our sun". It mean it can be a change people live there because in venus their is 97% of carbon dioxide it also can mean they can send people to visit or live their. The second reason is that " Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planerary visit". It means he does support this because he just says positves things that they have in learining information and that they also want to buy humans to go to venus and see how it be to be leaving their or how is it . They are really serious about studying that planet.

In conclution I think he does support studying Venus because he want to know about Venus or maybe it can be a planet like Earth because is close the the sun. Also, they had said that NASA

was working on so they can let them study Venus and know things they didn't know about Venus .
