I think you should join Seagoing Cowboys. I joined when I was almost eighteen, and it was a great experience for me. I am sure it would be for you, too. There are several reasons you should join.

First, it helps many countries, such as China and Greece. This program was formed in 1945, right after WWll. This means that many countries are in need of food, animals, and supplies. We just take care of the animals on the way to Europe. Then, we give them to different countries so they have a source of food and animals.

Secondly, it lets you see many countries. It helps you to experience things you otherwise wouldn't. You can see new things, try new foods, and meet new people. You can also tour and see new places. I saw the Acropolis in Greece, rode a gondola through the canals of Venice, toured a castle in Crete, and saw the Panama Canal. This was a great opportunity for me to broaden my horizons, and it could be for you, too.

Finally, it helps you learn new skills. This job teaches you responsibility, because you have to feed and take care of so many animals. On my first trip, there were more than 300 horses! You have to feed and water each one several times daily. Plus, you have to clean thier stalls and groom them. And that is just the horses! There would also be cattle, livestock, and other animals. You also have to learn how to communicate with people properly. If you are on a boat for two weeks to a month, you can't mess around or fight.

All in all, joining Seagoing Cowboys is a great idea. It is a great opportunity to help other countries, see new things, and learn new skills. I urge you to consider joining this program and having a great experience.
