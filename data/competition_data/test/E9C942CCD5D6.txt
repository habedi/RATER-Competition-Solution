studing venus can be very dangerous with how hot it is and how its the hottes planed even though murcury is the closest to the sun and the amountn of carbon dixide is really high. it is worth exploring because what if soething happens and we all need a place to go we cave a plane that is close enogh that we can go and it wouldnt be that hard. it could also not benefit us with the way the air pressure is if we get there and the air pressure is to high then it could kill us instently and there could be no point and going but if they figure out a way to get past the air pressure and make it safer then there are many reason to go and explore it and send a team of astronots to venus and let them set things up and do testing how the climat is and if there is a way to do the tsts that they need to to see if there is a way to live there and eventually build a whold nother home on that planet as "back up" planet. we need a back up planet that is closer than anyother planer and is we get on venus then it will be eaiser to look at other planets and explore and study them.
