Dear Principal,

I think that all students should not help in community service, because everyone doesn't want to do it. I think that only the students who want to do this activity should. Just think about it, some of the students wouldn't do it anyway, and some would do it just to go and hang out with their friends. But don't get me wrong some students would want to go not just to hang out with their friends or play around, some would go to try make the world a better place, and to try to help those younger children to get smarter.

But I think you should look at both sides of the story. I can say that because I'm a student and I know what my friends do and they ain't just going to go to do that, some will but not the others. Now me, some times I'll go to hang out and have fun, but mostly I'll do it to help people and to help the world. Sometimes it depends on what type of day I'm having. But since your the principal its your choose, I'm just trying to help you out a little, I'm not trying to get out of doing it, because I wouldn't mind, I need something to do anyway.

But really I think you should make everyone do it, and those who can't can pay the consequences. Say for example, if someone is acting up and can not behave their issues, then you can kick them out or write them up. Or you can just put them in a super boring class with none of their friends, where they just stare at the wall of something. But i ask you to please think about what i said before about that think about everybody and what they think not just a group of people or the facility, I'm not trying to be disrespectful, I'm just saying.

Sincerely.
