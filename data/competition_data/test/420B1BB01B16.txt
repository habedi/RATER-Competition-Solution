Students who want to succeed in their lives but aren't able to go to school for any reason; should be able to somehow complete their goals .

There is a several number of students out there in the world that aren't able to continue attending to school for whatever reason it could be but some of them want to keep their academic life, so they decide to take advantage of the help that some schools offer to students that is, distance learning. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

For example, let's talk about teenagers that become parents at the age of 17-18. Most of them are in high school, maybe they are 11-12 graders that aren't able to attend to school anymore because of their pregnancy or parenthood. They will need to somehow be parents and students at the same time,so there is where Distance Learning comes in, to help them by attending classes from home. Another example could be, Seniors that don't have too many classes but they have full time jobs, some of them want to focus on their jobs and decide to take classes online. I think that is a great idea, because they are able to go to work, generate money, be able to attend classes from home and with the same result as any other student. They are going to graduate from high school, be able to go to college and to keep their jobs.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home by having time to do some extracurricular activities such as babysitting their brothers/sisters, being able to do some sports or maybe doing something they like. A lot of students like to do extracurricular activities but most of them can't because of school.

Teenagers that become parents earlier in their lives tend to be frustrated of not being able to attend to school, problems at home begin and the idea of not finishing high school can be sometimes problematic. The fact that these teenagers are able to attend classes from home is such a wonderful help that schools could have gave them.

Same thing happens with seniors, a lot of 12 graders tend to choose not to take classes in school but online , they usually come to school for 2 classes and then they leave for work or any other activity they have to do, and the fact that these students can finish their classes and be able to go to work and do some other stuffs at the same time, brings them a lot flexibility on their daily life.

Most of the students love the fact of being at home and to do something they like instead of going to school, that's why some of them choose to take classes online from home, so they can have time to do something they like such as joining a club to do sports, maybe find a job or maybe just stay home and play video games.

In conclusion, The fact that students can attend to classes from home can save a lot of student's future, because they will be able to do a lot of things outside of the school ,maybe if there are problems at home, they can be there to solve them with their families, if there are economic problems, they are going to be able to get a job, generate money and to continue their academic life at the same time. But the most important fact is that they are going to be able to succeed in life, thanks to the help that some schools offer to them such as distance learning.
