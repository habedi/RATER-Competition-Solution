going on sea with animals is not what i call fun. it could be to them but not to me. I think it would be way more fun to go to a football game. im not really an animal guy im into sports .i dont think it would be a once in a life time thing i mean could do it more then 1 time.

ands if hes a cowboy i dont think he would be the best. for a cowboy. but if thats what he likes to do then great .I just could never see my self doing that. but i could see myself going to a football game with some friends. i would do it one time MAYBE

it just dont seem that fun. Night seems like a bad job like thats the job no one wants to get i would not want that job ethire one month on a bout to china i could not do thaqt way to nhard i would get sea sick like every day of me bing on that bout if i was him i would chang my sport to football or backetball and not bout and animal riding
