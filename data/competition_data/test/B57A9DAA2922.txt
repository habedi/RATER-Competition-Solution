Electric cars are a good thing for the future. It will be a while before they are perfected. However, I think they will have a positive impact on the road.

My first reason for thinking electric cars are good is the sensors. In paragraph 4 It talks about all the sensors in a Toyota Prius. This helps driver out with a lot of things.

Second is the Elictric car's ability to detect things in certain situations. So this will help out with places that are hard to see. This feature Will prevent a lot of wrecks from happening.

In paragraph 9 it says laws are against these cars. Paragraph 6 talks about how they are very limited right now. However, this is what time is for. They are not perfect right now,but there will be a lot more of them in 5 to 10 years when the improve even more.

They will be good for the road in a few years. The sensors will help out a whole lot. Lasst the ability to detect certain things will decrease the amount of wrecks. Therefore Electric cars will have a positive impact on the road.
