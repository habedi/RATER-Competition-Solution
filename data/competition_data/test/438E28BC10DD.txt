Should schools require students to practice their learning during summer break? and be prepared for the upcoming school year?

Although Some say schools should assign students work during the summer actually they shouldnt They should allow students to enjoy there summer break and do other activities for them to learn outside of school. Students can always have the option to learn but should also have their time on there own to learn social skills and have time with friends and family.

Those who say students should be assigned work over there summer break have heir reasons. Students can have a good start to the upcoming school year and not forget and have a tough time remembering certain learning skills. Students would not forget and would make it easier to start the school year and continue learning towards graduation.

Those who say Students should not recieve work over the summer also have their reasons as well. They want to let there students enjoy the break to allow them to take part in other activities outside of school and learn social skills. Some students can have a choice if they like to keep learning but should also have the time on their own to focus on other activities.

In conclusion Students shuld have the option to choose if they like to keep learning over their summer break to remember stuff for the upcoming school year but should also have the option to choose to take a break and enjoy their summer and engage in other activites outside of school and pick up more social skills as they move foward.
