Dear principal;

Community service should not be required by all students; community service should be optional for those students who want extra credit. it should be something students want to not something they are forced to do.

Community service should be optional because not everyone has the time to participate in it. Many students have full schedules weather in school or out; most of the time spent is on there school work. They should let it be an option because students need the resting time.

Community service should be optional because the students may not want to do it. If a student does not want to do it ; they shouldn't be forced to do so because if they are forced its not service its labor. Community service should be something students want to do not something they have to do. .

Community service should be optional because most of the students don't do it. if a student doesn't want to do community service and choose not to do so; should the student be penalized for not doing something they did not want to do? It wouldn't be very fair.

Therefore i think community service should be optional because its not fair and not many students enjoy doing it.

sincerely,
