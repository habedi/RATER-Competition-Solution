In this draft I will talk about reasons why you should join the program, give details from the artical to support Luke's claims, and I will sum it all with a conclusion.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you would be to help countries recover from war, recover their food supplies, animals, and more. The UNRRA which is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were being shipped over sea. This is what you would be doing if you joined the Seagoing Cowboys.

While Luke was in the program called Seagoing Cowboys he experienced many amazing sights. He experienced many sights, has been to places,and done many things like go to

Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, and took a gondola ride in Vience, Italy. He also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

In conclusion, as a Seagoing Cowboy you would do the things said in the paragraphs. I talked about the reasons to join the program.
