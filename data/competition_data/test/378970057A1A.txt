Little Generic_Name was assigned a summer project, he had to: attend a club over the summer, take pictures with the kids there, then write about what he liked the most about it. The project was teacher-designed and was due the first day of school. A few months went by and school was the very next day, little Generic_Name forgot all about the project and didn't do his assigned work so, he failed the project. Some people think summer work should be teacher-designed. I think summer work should be student-designed because, It's on your time, you can write about what you want, and you'll still have time to have fun during the summer.

First of all, having a student-designed project is better because it's on your time you don't have to worry about not knowing if the project makes sense or even worry that you don't finish on time because your to busy at home. For example, Generic_Name was assigned summer work but always seemed to be busy doing chores and helping his mom around the house. Everytime Generic_Name went to do his work, his mom would call him to do his chores or help with his brother, he felt he was never going to get his work done. Having a student-designed project can prevent you from forgetting about the assigned work from your teacher because some teachers want you to actually go out your way and expect it to be typed up, emailed, and done in mid summer. When you can just write about something you once expierenced before and be done with it on your time.

Secondly, having a student-designed project you can write about anything you want, anything you expierenced or ever done. You can take your time on it and not feel rushed by anyone. It's better having a sudent-designed project because if it was towards the end of summer you can make up something or think of a memory that happened during mid summer or towards the begining of summer. For example, Generic_Name didn't start her summer project that was due when she came back to school, she had a few days before school started. She rememered taking pictures on a special night with her friends and family while sitting at a bonfire and decided to write about that, her pictures were already ready. She realized it was easier having work assigned for herself and not from a teacher or assistant.

Last, while having student-designed work you can do your project and still have fun during the summer. You can do it right when you get home from the last day of school and have the full summer ahead of you or even wait right before school starts and do your project. Having summer work that was assigned from your teacher can be hard because they want you to do certain stuff like: visit the museum and write about it, go to the beach and collect seashells, or even go camping and take pictures of the wild. When you can just write about a special event that happend or even just write about what happend during your day at home or at the pool.

Some people think having teacher-designed work is much easier than having student-designed work. I think having student-designed work is easier and quicker than having to write out something you don't know to much about or doing work that doesn't interest you. Teachers assign work that they want you to do, summer is about fun and it should be up to the student wether what he/she want to write about. That's why I think student-designed work is better than teacher-designed work.

Having student-designed can later affect those in the future because the same thing we do may happen to them later on in life. Some people think teacher-designed work is easier however, they're wrong because teachers or assistants expect you to go out your way to write about something. Some kids dont go outside or some can be allergic to the pollen during the summer and decideds to stay inside. While having student assigned work you can talk about something you've done last summer or somthing that happend during the spring and write about it. You can write about anything that happened to you, you can do it on your own time and still have fun during the summer. Having student-designed work is much more easier than having teacher-designed work.
