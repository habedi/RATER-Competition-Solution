I am all for having this technology to read students emotional expressions. As a student myself, I get bored easily during class. Honestly I am bored right now.... Maybe if the teachers knew that us students get bored during class, maybe then they could find a way to keep students busy. Maybe even make school/school work a little more fun. The text says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Well that right there would help the teachers as well as the student. If this facial recognization can tell that we are also confused then the teacher would know what we need help with. Most students are shy and don't want to say anything when they are confused with their work. This whole thing would just be so much easier, honestly I don't understand why this isn't already a thing. The passage also states," Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." Seriously am I the only person that thinks this is a great idea? The students that have a hard time in a classroom setting could seriously use these. This would probably help home schooled kids! All I am saying is that scientists need to jump on this and get it out here, where us kids that struggle in school can actually enjoy it and graduate. This is a great idea and i will stand by my opinion until this is a thing. The fact that there could be something out there that could not only the older school setting, but also the kids that have ADHD that can't focus. My nephew has the hardest time in school not just because of that, but because most teachers now days are lazy and un considerate about what goes on in the classroom and I have seen this first hand. This facial recognization thing could be an amazing thing for students all of the globe.
