In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the authoor suggests that studying Venus is a bad thing to do and is very dangerous. The author gives a few reasons on why it is dangerous.

First, Venus is a very hot planet. People would sometimes think the hottest planet is Mercury because it is closer to the sun but it isn't the hottest. In paragraph 3 is explains that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degreea, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. For example, diving to the deepest part of the oceans would liquefy many metals.

Second, a long time ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. But today, Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. So maybe a long time ago it would have been nice to visit but now, it isn't. Way to hot and it is covered all in rocks and valleys.

Lastly, in paragraph 5 it explains that "Hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." So even if you wanted to try to go to Venus, you would die of heat. Your vehicle would not make it back.. you wouldn't either.

I think the author did good at supporting his idea with many reasons. The author gave many reasons why you shouldn't try to travel to Venus.
