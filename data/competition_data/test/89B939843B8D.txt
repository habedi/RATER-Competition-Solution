I think that student designed summer projects are more beneficial. It's easier for them to express themselves and their imagination. When making the project the student will find a topic that is interesting to them. By finding an interesting topic, themselves as students, make it a lot easier for them to express their ideas. If the topic and design of the project is chosen by the students, its more understood and well put for them.

When creating the projects the students really use their imagination. The fact of creating something themselves is exciting. Once they have found something interesting that they enjoy presenting about, it is easier for them to find the information needed. When students are interested in their projects, they more than likely do better. Because their imaginations are intrigued by the interesting information, students enjoy working on the projects they have chosen. More effort is put into projects when students fully understand the concept of the topic and design.

If students have a better understanding of what there doing, they are most likely to try harder. If something is not understood by a student they may loose interest in it and eventually give up. By designing their project and choosing their topic, the students will know what there project is on and how they need to present it. Some students feel the need to give up or just not even try, when they do not understand or like what their project is on.

Teachers should not design the students summer projects, because many students can feel pressured and stressed to meet a teachers goals and standards for their project. The students worry that they will not have the right information or even enough. Some students feel that there is just simply too much information that the teacher is asking for. That being said those students who think that would do the project, but would not complete it.

I think that student designed summer projects are better for the learning of students. It gives students room to learn. They are able to use their imagination to the fullest. When designing a project a student can express how they feel or think on a particular topic. Giving students this opportunity to design their own summer projects, is a great idea to help show them their responsibilities and their abilities.Â
