Do you like to do community service? I like to do community service because if helps out thee less fortunate people who can't do stuff for there self because they don't have money or are homeless. I think that making everybody do community service would make the world come together and be a better place and it could keep our environment clean. It could stop some of the bad things from coming because most people don't have anything better to do then get them selves into trouble if they do community service it would give them something to do.

Doing community service to help the less fortunate is good. It could help provide a roof over peoples head who don't have one. It could provide them with clothes and food. Just think about it you could be doing something good for someone else and not just yourself. And i'm pretty sure the people that we are helping out would be just as thankful as we are to help them out.

Doing community service would help the world come together and be a better place. It would bring people to work together and get to know others. And it would get people to clean up the environment and stop throwing stuff around just anywhere. It could get everyone to just work together and clean up and help out the environment.

Doing community service could prevent bad things such as crimes from happening because most of the time people don't really have anything to do but do things that could get them into trouble with the law. It could give them something to do instead of doing bad things such as robbing people or shooting and things like that. It could change a person if they see how hard some people have it out here and maybe make them stop doing things that they have no business doing anyway. It would be something good that they would be doing for them and someone else who needs it.

Overall i think that community service is a good idea. It could help make the world come together and be a better place, it could help out the less fortunate people and help them get what they need done, it could help kids and adults stay out of trouble. So i would think that doing community service is a good idea.
