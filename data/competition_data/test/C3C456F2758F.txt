During the Summer many children don't even go to the extent of keeping up with school and or education by any means, then once school arrives, their knowledge is stale and their memory can take a while to be refreshed and can potentially harm their grades and overall performance for a significant amount of time. This is why Summer projects should be assigned by teachers, to provide children with a task, to help further expand and maintain their knowledge and state of well being.

Giving students a task will be beneficial towards their knowledge.

Throughout the Summer, from experience, there will be days people will just sit around and do absolutely nothing. This can do nothing but harm the them. The brain is required exercise therefore, not challenging or applying the brain to anything could potentially reduce knowledge; with that they'll also lose their work ethic and lack performance come the school year. If students were given the option to "create" the project and the idea, they'll most likely be lazy, and the project will be frail and irrelevant to the main objective of the project in the first place.

Socially , having a school project during the Summer can also, provide people with social interactions they may not go about even in school rather that, their everyday life. Via their job it's a teachers job to ensure the education of their students and to provide them with the essential knowledge they'll need to succeed in life. Therefore, its not as if the teacher is giving a bunch of work for the student to complete with no context; it's meant to keep them occupied and provide them with work that won't only be beneficial to whoms knowledge, but also, it can very well be fun and be one of the highlights of their summer. Giving students this task will ensure they engage in activity to help benefit their knowledge, work ethic, social life, and well being.

During the Summer, people, especially children, aren't always prone to everyday activity; this can be a very large set back to their well being on many different standpoints, their knowledge can be reduced as well as their overall motivation and work ethic. Giving students a task will allow them to expand their mindset and even their goal exploratory with their overall life. Laying around doing nothing, and or not complying to any form of education, will be a major set back to a student's well being; with a lack of interest or occupation of any means, they'll achieve high levels of boredom, which could potentially lead to behavioral changes; such as, depression, and bad behavior... as in pursuing bad actions and or illegal actions. This is why giving students a task over the Summer, via their teacher, will ensure the safety of their well being and the maintenance of their knowledge.

In conclusion, over the Summer projects assigned by a teacher are beyond advantageous and a great way maintain knowledge, further expand knowledge, and protect whoms well being. Given the circumstances of today's society, people, especially minors, are more than likely to engage in negative conduct if they lack an interest in something or an occupation. This is why giving a task, especially a school oriented project, will keep them on the right track and derive only good conduct and benefactors.
