Kids these days spend so much time on social media and electronics and they interact with real life and people as little as possible, so how do we change this? Here is a perfect solution, It should be mandatory for students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. It might sound crazy, but this concept will not only keep the students off of their electronics, but it will also help them meet people and make friends face to face and they can develop important skills that will help them throughout their life. More schools should really consider this idea.

Taking part in extracurricular activities prevents students from using their electronics as much as they would. Students that are in extracurricular activities are occupied with whatever they are doing and don't have as much time to stay on social media and electronics. It is very healthy to take a break from focusing on electronics whether you are using social media or working on a project. Extracurriculars allow students to take their mind off of social media and school work by letting them have fun or challenge them in other ways. Social media and school can be stressful and this is a healthy way to take your mind off of the stress.

Students are able to make real life friends instead of online friends. These activities allow students to get to know each other and bond over their similar interests. It provides time for students to hangout together and have fun. This helps students develop strong friendships and students can also meet outside of the extracurricular activities and grow their friendships. It is really important for students to have healthy relationships with other kids their age.

Participating in activities outside of school helps develop important life skills such as; communication, collaboration, creative thinking, and problem solving. Students develop these skills by having conversations with other students about the activity they are participating in or any other topic. Students can express their creativity in something other than school, and they are able to share their talents with others and work together to create something amazing. There are many more skills they can develop, but these are some of the most important ones and they help when students go out into the real world.

Extracurricular activities are very important for students and help them in many different ways. Students are busy and don't think about electronics, they develop relationships with people in real life. They also get a head start on the skills they will be needing for the rest of their lives. Extracurricular activities basically help students change to be better people. Extracurricular activities are very healthy and necessary for students.
