Dear principal,

I believe that choice number one would be the best decision because students would bring there phones any way despite the rules.

If you allow students to use there phones during lunch and other free times that would decrease there need to text during classes. Also students would not have to try to hide the phones during there free times. I personally agree with this option because how I see it is if you are not doing anything in class and the teachers allow you to have free time i don't understand why you couldn't its just like talking accept that it is texting and your on a phone, also in decreases the noise level since they would be texting. Also i think it is a good idea to let students have their cell phones because of after school activities, they don't always end on time and instead of using the schools energy they would be using their own.

I do believe that letting students have their cell phones would be a good thing for the school and the students. So with this I hope you consider option number one for the schools phone dilemma.

Sincerely

Former student
