Introduction:

Many Students that takes class at home is not a benefit for them, Because home and school have a big different, on school you can learn better than home, because teacher tech you how you can do your work more easily and at home you can do your yes you can do your work, but is not the same thing cause nobody in in there to help us. Student can say, yes take classes online at home can be cool, but what happened when they have to take a SOL? They do not what they have to do because they don't practice with a teacher no one tech them to pass their classes and SOL. If we have schools is because students have to be there on schools. Take classes at home is not a better idea to me because we have to wake up, come to school take all our classes, learn new things at school because is there where that teachers are to be ours heroes and helps us to be someone someday on the life. Not everybody like that idea because they thinks like me, how a English online class can help us? if sometimes we don't know what we are doing on school can be more hard at home with a computer that can talk with you face to face only give you instructions and that's it.

Body paragraph:

Take classes online at home which can be the benefit for us? nothing because is not the same thing, last year I'll take English 11 online and that not help me because I can't understand because everything was different in there nobody told me how I can do my work, or no one show me examples, nobody talked to me face to face and then I failed my English 11 class because I never understand that because was difficult and very different to school. I prefer wake up early Monday to Friday at 6:00 A.M. and come to school because is better cause I know I can learn something new and interesting and teacher can teach me and show me how to do my works in class and that's a benefit because your learn easily and you have all your friends close to you, and you know you can be someone someday because now you learn how studies work. it's a little hard sometimes but if you want to be someone important in the life you have to work so hard on the school and be prepared. Take online classes for some students can be easily way to pass their classes and maybe they right, because you don't have to present projects, or resolve problems of math, or sometimes discuss with your teachers because you don't want to do your work that's a easily way to pass our classes, but that not help like a teacher in class because a computer or tablet don't talk to you and explain how you have to do your work and computer just give you instructions and that's it and what happens if you don't understand the instructions? you do not do your work because you don't know how to do it, while a teacher can explain you the whole class if you don't understand cause that's their work help students, so I think online classes is a bad idea because that help students to be more lazy. and they don't want to attend school.

Conclusion:

Many people think If they want to created a program for students to take classes online it can be work, but it can be different too because that things which have low price can be more costly than a high price. I only wants to say is online classes can help students to take other classes which they need and take one at home, but what happens if someday in a university he or she don't understand what the teacher is talking about, because they take that class on a computer and nobody explains to them how to do that work. Attend class on school can be better for your future and be someone someday. because you can remember what the teachers teach you in class.
