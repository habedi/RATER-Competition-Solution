Dear principle.

I strongly think that you should go with policy number two. I have three reasons why we should not have cell phones in school.

first off, cell phones are just a distraction. Kids will bring there phone to class and text when the teacher is not looking. When a student is texting it distracts other student to because there worried about what the other student is doing. And if these two arnt the case then the student isn't paying attention because all there thinking about is lunch when they can use there phone.

My second reason is cheating. Now a days kids have all shorts of things on cell phones that can help them cheat on tests. They have calculators or they could have put the answers in there phone. If kids know that one of there friends had a class before them they could text them for there answers. There are many was that kids can use a cell phone to cheat on a test or homework.

My final reason that kids shouldn't have cell phones in school is that kids wont do there work. If kids are doing work and there's a phone in front of them there going to drop what there doing and chose the phone over home work. Even if there just taking a break from there work and use the phone there going to get so wrapped up in it there going to forget there work. No kid is going to pick home work over a phone in this modern day.

I gave you three reasons why kid shouldn't have phones in school and there are plenty more. I hope you consider my reasons and bane phones from school.
