Mr. Principle

I personally enjoy helping out in the community and I know others do too. However I am also aware that some people think it is a waste of time. Personally though instead of making it mandatory I suggest that you make it option with rewards for doing so because sometimes people are busy and don't have time, some people might be enticed by a reward, and some people won't like it as much if they are forced to do it.

First off some people have free weekend to do what they want with but some people don't. Quite a few people have sports, music classes or other things they do on the weekend so that they don't fall behind on homework. And doing all these things gives the little to relax which helps people perform better later on and also allows them to have their friends over which help with social skills. And thus If you make community service banditry the wouldn't have time for those activities that promote their general health and make the more well rounded individuals and better later in life.

Secondly some people would do the service but if they fell they don't get anything out of it then it fells like a chore and then they will only do it when forced. So enticing them with a reward like a certificate for hours done or turn it into a competition where the class with the most cumulative hours gets a pizza party or something similar for just the class will make students more interested. Other rewards could be like reusable bags with the school mascot, or extra credit points if the teacher allows it for example. And if students star doing it without felling tortured then later on they might learn to enjoy it and continue doing community service later on in life.

Finally historically when people are forced to do something they tend to star wanting to fight it. Therefore if you make service mandatory and students are forced to do the ones who don't like will start looking on it poorly and like a punishment and would want do it ever again. also the will stat doing service quickly and not well so that they can be done and will leave at the minimum required time even if not finished. Also if students come into something felling that they aren't going to like it then it would be harder to change their minds and make them enjoy doing the activity.

so as you can see id community service is made mandatory many students will not enjoy it unless it is optional and can accommodate for busy schedules, feel rewarding for students, and isn't forced on they are more likely to enjoy it
