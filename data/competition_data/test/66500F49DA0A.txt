Your principal has decided that students are required to take at least one extracurricular activity, do you agree with this? I agree with this because you may want to stay interested in any of your schools activities. It is important because students want to stay active with there schools and the best way by doing that is by having something for students to experience. Schools have activities for students to do after school because they want them to stay active. Students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students gain responsibility, helps get students motivated, benefit their college and job application.

First things first, having extracurricular activities can help students gain responsibility because in some cases students will be doing things that take someone with responsibility to do. For example, students that are in sports are responsible for having the appropriate shoes and clothes for their practices. This is one reason why activities, that certain schools have, are important. This will motivate students to do better and they would want to succeed in whatever they are doing. This leads me to my second reason.

Secondly, it could help students get motivated to do better in school. This is important because extracurricular activities require you to have good grades and if you like one of the activities you are doing you will be motivated to do good so that you can stay in it. This can allow tons of students to be successful in school and they will try hard in school. Students might want to do certain activities that require them to have good grades and if they don't then they can't do it. This is why in order to do what you like you need to do good in school and it is very important to do good in school.

Lastly, extracurricular activities will benefit you when you are trying to apply for a job or just trying to get into a college of your choice. The first thing is that it may help you look good when putting whatever you did on your paper. For example, someone can put they did track and then they got an award for winning a competition, that would make their paper look good. Another example is that if you want to get a specific job and you are in a certain club were they teach you about the job could really benefit you. Like stated in the previous paragraph, it could help you take care of your grades and if you do have good grades colleges would want you. This could help you in the long run because it is important to have some experience with what job you want. Extracurricular activities can help you get to know how you feel about this and if you want to do this in the future.

In conclusion many students need to be responsible in order to keep the activity they want. Students will become motivated to do better so that they can stay in that certain activity. Students will have the experience and they will be able to get the job that they want. These reasons prove on why it is important to have extracurricular activities. This is why I agree on how students should be entitled to at least on activity because it helps students gain responsibility, helps students get students motivated, and it helps students on their job application and college application.
