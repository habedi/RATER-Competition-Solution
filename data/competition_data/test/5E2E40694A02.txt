My name is Luke Bomberger and I am a member of the UNRRA or Sea Cowboys. This program is the experience of a lifetime. You should join the Sea Cowboys because you get to see many famous places like Greece, China, and Europe. Another reason you should join is because you can have fun on the ships by playing games with your fellow cowboys.

If you join the Sea Cowboys then you can go to many places like Venice, The Panama Canal, the Acropolis, and castles. This can be good for your reseme, or getting into a college. This also can give you experiance if you host an exchange student.

Another bonus to joining the Sea Cowboys is that it is a lot of fun. On the ships you can play cards, whittle, and reading. On return trips though the holds for the animals are empty so you can have boxing, fencing, table tennis, volleyball, and baseball games.

Some people however may say it is to dangerous at sea but I believe the benifits outway their doubt.

These are reasons I think people should join the Sea Cowboys program. It is fun, and it gives you a chance to visit foreign places. So remember these reasons next time you want to sign up or a long term job.
