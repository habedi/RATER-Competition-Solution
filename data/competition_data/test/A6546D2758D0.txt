Do you know that many schools would not attend classes from home. The schools say that attend classes at the school a lot batter than attend from home. Many students would like to attend from home so they can sleep more, but It will not help them to be success in education, even it will make them more lazy, and they will not have that support to study. Attend classes at home by way of online or video conferencing is not good idea and ti's not helpful for all the students. Thay will not be success in thair education and they will have very hared time studing.

When taking an online classes Many of the students will not be success in the studing. If you had a good graed in classroom and change to online class your graed will go dwon. When you take online class you will not have that much explaination on waht the teacher talking about. For example, when you study with your friends all the time and on time you studing by yourself you will feel your missing something and you will have a hared time studing by yourself.

Attending classes online will make some of the students so lazy. They will be lazy to wake up on time to attend the classes, they will not work hared and payattention. For example, my friend took an online class last year and he failed the calss I asked him why you failed the class he said "man I was sleeping all the time and I didn't attend the class every day that's way I failed". that is what happend to him he was so lazy and in the end he failed.

Attend classes online will be not good for students who don't understand clearly. In the classroom will be easily to get the idea because you need someone in fron of you to teaching you and to explaining to you clearly to understand good. When you take an online calss you will not be as in the classroom, in the class is differant, you will have a teacher who will help you when you need and explain to you clearly. Also, if you didn't understand you can also ask the teacher explain again.

All the schools shoud not offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes form home. That will be not helpful for the students. The students sould go to school and study in the calssrooms with the theachers in front of them. Also, all the students should be supporting that and traing to be away form online clasess.
