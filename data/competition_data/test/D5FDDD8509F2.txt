Different students have many different ways of learning that help them understand and comprehend information. Being able to do your work from home could benefit some students. However, I don't think that would be the best learning experience for most kids.

I don't think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. My reasoning is that I do believe many students learn best when they are in a healthy learning environment. Personally I grasp the lesson more when I have a teacher upfront of the class explaining everything rather learning from a computer screen. Not only do I grasp the information more but there are some students that learn best with hands on activities such as labs, building projects, and other hands on activities. There are also a lot of distractions at home that could take your attention away from the lesson like your phone, other family members, pets, etc. There are also greater ways to cheat on tests, quizzes, and classwork while you are at home. You could easily pull out your phone, or look up the answers to a test on another computer.

Attending classes from home could also introvert kids. Many kids' social life is at school where you talk to your friends and make new friends, if you attend classes from home you will most likely lose many of those friendships or never make those friendships while at home. Another reason why I believe attending school would benefit kids is because many of your jobs will be in person and you will have to work with a lot of different people and different personalities. Therefore, school would give a little bit of that experience. Also what I was saying before, there are healthy and unhealthy learning environments. For example, say if there is constantly something going on at home such as, your parents always yelling or your siblings are always loud. That is very distracting and could take away from you learning.

With that being said, many people could argue that students would benefit from attending classes from home. Plenty of college classes are online where do your work from home. Therefore many could say that prepares you for college life. Not only are there online college classes, but there are also stay at home jobs that could benefit from attending school from home. Also just like there are students that learn best in a classroom, there are students that learn best from home. Those are some reasons why attending classes from home could benefit learning.

There are many different kinds of students that learn many different kinds of ways. However, I believe that learning at school is more beneficiary for most students because it provides a healthy learning environment, there are many hands on activities, it prepares you for many jobs and dealing with people, there is a greater chance that you will have a better social life, and there are less distractions at school. I would recommend you to find the best way that helps you learn, so you can get your best learning experience.
