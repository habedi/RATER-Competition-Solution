How would it make you feel if you were forced to do something against your will?

Well unfortunately that is what is happening to the students of this school today. Through my eyes students should not be forced and required to do at least one extracurricular activity. In this paper I will explain my reasoning behind my argument and why it is unjust to make students do extracurricular activities.

To start the argument my first claim is that the principle does not decide whether a student is to do an extracurricular activity.

In my perspective extracurricular activities are decided in the best interest of the student and is decided within the family. Not to mention the sports require a tryout. So if you don't make a sports team then the student may have to do something that does not appeal to their interests. I do not see the problem that is trying too be solved by making all the students do extracurricular activities.

There are many reasons why kids and students should not be forced to do extracurricular activities but to keep it short and sweet I chose my top two.

My second reason is that the interests of students are not all the same. Some students interest range from the sports and all the things that are provided at school to stuff such as fitness courses, the martial arts, and much more than just the regular things at school. Plus if they already started doing something outside of school then the extracurricular activities for them get very mixed up and quite frankly messes with their schedules.

This one does not take to much thought but would you rather be doing something you love or something you were forced to do. Me from personal experience would much rather do something I love because whenever I am forced to do something I am least likely to do it or be very upset and . When I speak for kids around my age I think we all can agree on that.

I realize that some people may say a good side to this topic is that it looks good on a resume or application and that it allows the kids to be more social. For the first part of the statement that was made, yes it would look nice on a resume for your kids but the thing is it is not your resume, it is theirs.

I do not think if what is on their resume they did not like or were forced to do they are not going to enthusiastically talk about the accomplishment. In my opinion you are correct about being social. But kids can be social in many other ways throughout the day. Some examples are already in the school day and in this day and age kids have so much more ways to be social.

Now that I have stated some evidence out of many I hope you see that us kids need to make choices for our selfÂ to practice for the real world. We need to decide what we are interested in and not what the principle is interested in for us. Our interests are usually what we pursue in life because we enjoy them. If we are doing something we don't enjoy then we are least likely to enjoy doing something related to whatever we did not enjoy because it was against our will.
