Dear Principal,

You asked for student's opinions on the subject of the new school rule that concerns whether students should be able to participate in after-school activities or sports if they have a C or lower average. I do think this is a good idea. This new rule can be a motivation for students who slack off in school, and now they can have a reason to work harder.

A grade of a C is a passing grade, so students think it's all right to not work any harder because they're already passing. However, a C is not what students should strive for. Taking away privileges, such as after-school activities or sports, is an excellent way to make students work harder to get a B. However, I do think you should either allow them to go to study sessions or start study groups to help them achieve and maintain a B or an A.

In addition, this would help our whole school learn things faster, because students will have to work to receive maintain a B or an A, unlike when they had a C. Although this might cause the sports teams or school clubs to lose members, I think it is worth it. I believe that students should be more concerned about their grades than their clubs or sports. I also think that parents would be more proud of their children for trying harder in school because of the motivation.

Also, teachers would be happier with the students because they are working harder. If the students pay more attention in class and do their homework, and stay after for extra help, the teachers will be happier and more encouraging because the students are trying hard. Furthermore, the students with a C average will learn that they have to work hard to achieve a goal, and that maintaining a B or an A average takes work and determination.

I believe this new school policy of "Having a B average will allow you to participate in after-school activities and sports" is a great one. I think it will help students work harder, teachers being more encouraging, and overall help our school. I'm all for it!
