Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore ? Well no I can't really imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore . I can't imagine that because theres always gonna be a time where you need to go somewhere & your gonna need transportation to get you there . If there were no cars in the future so many lives would be so miserable because who would wanna walk everywhere they need to go? I know I would get tired of walking . There's so many places where people need to be on time but only with some kind kind of transpotation . Life wouldn't be so great without cars because just even walking the house or even to go down the street for something important would really get annoying & tired .

When reading paragraph 7 it talks about how BMW announced the development of ''Traffic Jam Assistant in 2013. Well just because there were alot of "Trafic Jams'' in 2013 doesn't mean just think about the future without any cars . We need transpotation everywhere we go. I know that there's many of ways for transportation but walking , I don't think that's really a great idea knowing that we walk 24/7 365 days out of the whole year . Having a car & knowing that you can drive it around anytime you would like to is actually good , because even though the gas that you put in your car goes up a dollar or 2 every week doesn't just give up or think about not having cars in the future. There are teenagers all over the world that are looking foward to getting them a car when they get older & even teens and adults now that are wishing that they could get them a car.

My position on driveless cars is that what is a driveless car if you still need a driver to drive the car ? You will always need someone to drive the car even if it is a driveless car. There are car crashes everywhere you go , but you can always fix that problem by sharing the road with the other drives . Watching out for other drivers and the people that are walking is a big step of getting behind the wheel . Making sure that there aren't other people in the way so that you will not hit them & even following the rules of the road , like making sure that you stop at STOP signs & even waiting for your turn to turn while driving. There's no need to imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore.
