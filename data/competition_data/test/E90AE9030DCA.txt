They really should ban cars in big cities. The only thing they shouldn't ban is, buses and taxies .

This willstop alot of air pollution and stress. (

Carlos Arturo Plaza)

Well lets get it started. The car usage should be limited only in big cities. The reason I said this because, most Vaubans streets are "car-free". Big cities limited there cars to be on the streets. There really no places to park unless you pay for a spaces with you house in that's 40,000 dollars itself or you have to go to a huge gargage. Most vaubans familys do not own cars. They sold there cars to move there. The way you have to get around is by foot or bicycles. Well I think that cars should be limited in big cities. I said this because less money coming out your pocket in less wrecks happing if you ban cars from the street.

Something else I said why cars should be limited from the streets is because, there are stree and air pollution. They way this is happing is by gas leaks, oil , and more. The reason I said this is because, banning cras from the streets will have less stress and air pollution. The way this is happing because gas leaks , oil, and others. All the leaks, bad drivers are getting into people head. If you know it or not less car usage will clear up everything. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. This means that the population wasnt bad and the stress and air pollution was not high.

The more car usage on the streets will have you stress out and the air pollution will be bad. If all this was taken away you reallywouldn't have to worry about anything unless there cars on the streets.
