Dear Principal,

You should consider a vote from all staff and students to help you decide on weather or not cellular devices should be allowed period. Some friends and I have talked about your decisions, and have decided that policy number one would be perfectly fine with out questioning. That being said here is something to convince you that the first policy is the best choice.

If students were allowed to use cellular devices during their lunch and free hours only, they could use the cellular device to help with school work, and contact teachers and friends. To help understand I have come up with an example to help you see why this policy make sense. You have a student who has trouble doing homework at home because of the environment at his/ her home. so they decide to complete their homework during their lunch/ free hours. While doing a math problem they get stuck and can't figure out the answer to the equation and a calculator is no where near... If they were allowed to use there phone they could possibly use the calculator that has been pre- programmed into it. It's happened to students before and it will definitely happen again.

That wasn't the best example but it sounded very convincing to myself, so if you could please just think this over and definitely consider a vote from the school. It would be worth the time.

thanks, your fellow student,
