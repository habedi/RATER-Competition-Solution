Dear Principal,

I think Policy 1 is the best ideal. I think we should be able to have are cell phones in school but during class time they should be turned off. If the teacher lets them have their cell phones out during their class then i think its a great ideal. If students start not getting their homework done then they shouldn't be able to use their cell phones for a whole week in school. I don't think they should be used at lunch because they don't talk to any of their friends they just text. I think we could use them in study hall. I you don't have any homework to do and you don't feel like reading you could text or play games.

If you have your cell phone out i think that they should be on vibrate so then you don't bother the other students while they are working on homework or something else. I think Policy 1 is the best ideal. Thank you for listening to me and my opinions!!!
