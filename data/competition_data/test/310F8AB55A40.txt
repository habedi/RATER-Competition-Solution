Dear Principal,

Imagine a world where school was struggle for you, no matter how much you work or try you never seem to get that A or B you're seeking. When school is done you're finally relieved because you get to play basketball with all your friends. Now hearing that you have to have a B average is going to crush you. Even though you've been working so hard. Therefore Students should be allowed to play sports or other activities even with a C average.

Good and hard working kids sometimes end up with a C average. They always try there best and do their homework. When those tests come around they just don't seem to get it, like all their hard work has gone to waste. These kids shouldn't have to quit their favorite activity if their grades are just average. Just because they got C shouldn't make them less capable to do the sports they find so enjoyable. Some of these C students might even work as hard as the students who are getting straight A' s.

Learning comes different to every person, for one it may be very easy and the topic isn't a struggle at all. For another the topic may not make any sense at all and they have to work so hard to try and understand but they never fully do. That student makes a C but the other gets an A even though they C student may have worked twice as hard.

Therefore students should be allowed to play sport or other activities even with a C average. Coaches and supervisors don't want to loose a fantastic players just because of a grade. The grade almost says nothing about that child and they shouldn't be judged by it. Keeping that kid in the sport or activity may keep their grades where they are and have a more positive attitude. Keep the standards for grades at C average and make they students happier.

sincerely,
