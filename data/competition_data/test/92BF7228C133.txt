To the Principal,

I'm writing this letter to tell you how I feel about you considering to make all your students perform community service. I think you shouldn't make all your students help. Only the ones who want to. I know it would help a lot, but you shouldn't make kids do anything if they don't want to.

First off even if you make the student help, they might not even try hard because your forcing them to help. If they chose themselves then they wanted to help and will try to do a good job. Also kids should be able to pick what they want to do. They shouldn't have people picking everything for them. It could also cause a lot of problems with the students parents. The parents could get very upset that your making them help when they might now want to.

Another problem with that is other things going on in there life. The students could have another things to do like sports, Clubs, Homework groups, Etcetera. They might not have a lot of time to help with community service. Also most kids are having trouble in school and should spend there time studying not helping the community.

Sometimes you have to think about if you were the students. You would like to be forced to do something that you don't really want to do? I bet if you had another stuff to do, you wouldn't want to miss it to help with the community. Even though there kids that doesn't mean they aren't busy with everyday stuff, There is homework, Sports, and maybe some fun stuff too like spending time with friends or family.

Some ideas that wouldn't force them, and kind a make them want to help is to give an reward out for everyone who is helping. Give them a pizza party, Cash, anything kids like. So if won't be forcing them. Or maybe you could just ask kindly to help out a little bit. I think those ideas are better then forcing them to help.

Thanks for reading my letter! I Hope you don't force them and maybe listen to some of my ideas.

Thanks Again,

Student
