Dear Principle,

We definitely should not go through with this horrific idea. Your team sports will quickly lose many athletes and will probably not have enough players to even start. Many kids do have a C average that are excellent football, basketball, soccer, tennis, or softball players. Some kids can't help their learning skills as well as others. It definitely wouldn't be fare to the kids.

If I had to guess your schools athletic programs would not be very successful, do to the loss of players to the team. you will see your teams record, stat's, and even fan base decrease because of the loss of talent and depth in your depth chart. You will soon regret this very drastic decision if this change is made.

I don't think that I am the only one who feels this way about this decision. I myself have a C average in school, and I try very hard to maintain that so I can play football and basketball. Please Sir, just think about your decision. I and the whole Student Body ask of you to not change the average.

Thank You,
