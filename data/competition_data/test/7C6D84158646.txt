There was a phone that was able to be carried anywhere, but it was large, thick, and heavy. Later technologists invented the new phone small, less heavy and just the right size for one's hand which is easy to carry everywhere and fit in a pocket. Before this new design, there was not a lot of phone use in cars and not so many accidents. Years later, the most popular phone is the iPhone by Apple. Many people buy phones because they use social media, Bluetooth, the internet, and other apps. Several people become distracted when they receive messages or notifications while driving because they pick up the phone to answer it. Using cell phones while driving should be banned to help decrease accidents, deaths, and legal consequences. Opponents of banning cell phone use while driving believes it is not the only distraction to drivers. What we should do is produce new technologies that make the practice safer for everyone.

I agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that happen on a daily bases. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like the flu. Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many people with them. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc.

The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. Driving requires a great amount of concentration, judgment, and precision when you are using a cell phone your concentration is greatly shifted from the road to the cell phone. When texting or calling a call they are not looking at the road they are looking at their cell phone within that split second you are putting your life and somebody else's life in danger. Many car accidents in the U.S are caused by texting while driving. If they ban cell phone usage while driving, they could save millions of lives, they will be more graduations rather than funerals.
