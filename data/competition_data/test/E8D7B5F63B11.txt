My principle has made a decision that requires all students to participate in extracurricular activities. Such as sports, yearbook, or student council. Most students would disagree with his decision, however, I agree with his decision. By having students participate in extra curricular activities, students can find something that benefits them. There is an activity for every student to benefit from by participating.

One activity a student can participate is sports. My school offers, spring,fall, and winter sports every student is given the chance to try out. It is a great opportunity for students who like being active or want to become more active to have fun and become part of a team where they can form strong bonds with their teammates. Who may share the same interest as them. Which is why joining a sport as an extracurricular activity is a good option to take part in.

Another activity that students can take participate in is student council. Student council offered to those who want to be more active in there school. Student council members are typically in charge of supporting students views in what should be done in our school. By students joining the council the school would have more student views in what should be done to help. Improve or have fun school activities throughout the school year. If students would like to become more active in strongly believe this is a good activity for them.

My final activity I believe is a great activity option for students to participate in is Yearbook club. Yearbook is a club that makes or designs the yearbook. For students who enjoy creating, marketing, and photography, Yearbook is a great option for them. The club consist of four teams, Design, writing, marketing, and Photography. Students can choose to take part which ever one they choose. Writing team goes around interviewing students and staff, marketing team creates flier and how much the yearbook will cost. Photography takes pictures of the schools' events, teachers and staff, and clubs. Finally we have design team, they put everything together to create the yearbook. If students are interested they are given the chance to join, just like with every club and activity my school offers.

As I stated before our school offers plenty of extracurricular activities for students. Each one benefits each student, the activities I have described were just a few that I strongly believeÂ are great options to take part in. Sports help you stay active and fit, student council helps students become more active in pushing students views,and a yearbook allows students to take part in the delevopemet of the yearbook using skills they have. Taking part in extracurricular activities are beneficial to every student. They just have to find on they enjoy doing, Which is why I strongly agree with my principles decision, students should take extracurricular activities.
