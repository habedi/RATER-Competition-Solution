Dear principle,

I think that you shouldn't make it to where only students with a B or higher could go into sports or after school activities because some of these students depend on sports or other activities. First some students want to do sports to get their mind off of big tests or other projects they need to do, some students want to get more active to loose weight and finally some students just need time away from their family. Most of these students have C' s but they want to go into sports but cant if you make it only to where there grades can only be A' s and B' s.

First off, why I think it should stay the same is because some students want to do sports to get their mind off of tests or big projects coming up. When you join a sport then all you think about is the game that you are going to attend. You will have your mind set on what place you are going to come in and you aren't thinking about all of those big tests or projects that are coming up or that are due. It is said that if you go to sports then you will have a higher metabolism to loose more weight quicker.

Secondly, I think that you shouldn't change it because some kids want to loose weight. Most kids cant get out of the house and exercise so they turn to sports. They want to loose weight to be more thin so they have fun with their friends in a sport that they are mostly interested in. People like to do things with their friends so they can ask their friend if they want to join the same sport/ activity with them. Parents will really love the program and encourage their child to join so we have a bigger team.

Finally, why I think that it should stay the same is because kids don't want to be stuck at home all the time playing video games and getting more over weight so they go off and they join a sport. The kids now a days love to be more active weather it out side playing with their animal, or its running down the block or maybe even riding their bike to a friends house they go and get active. There is lots of kids who stay home. Those kids don't know the outside world and they should but some have low grades. Some student don't have lots of friends either and s

I really want you to take into consideration why I believe you should keep the grades the same. First off some kids do after school activities to get their minds off of big projects or tests, secondly some kids do sports to loose weight and finally some kids do sports to get away from family. For all of these reasons this is why you should keep it a C or higher grade.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
