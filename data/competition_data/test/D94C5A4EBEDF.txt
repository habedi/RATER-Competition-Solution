Should teachers pick students summer projects, or should the students pick their own? School systems are beginning to give students projects over the summer. This idea will constantly keep the students involved and learning. The summer projects should be teacher-designed because it prepares the students for the upcoming year, it prepares the students for the workforce, and it gives constant interactions with the material for the upcoming year.

First, the reason why the summer projects should be teacher-designed is because the students would be ready for the upcoming year. If the teachers design the projects the students will be used to him/her giving them instructions. For example, if Generic_Name was not assigned his own project, and he picked his own it might pick a easy project which he would not put all his effort into. However, if Generic_Name was assigned a project by his teacher he would not have any other choice, so he would be more efficient with his time and work. One can easily see that if the teachers pick the summer projects it would be more effective.

Second, another reason why the summer projects should be assigned by teachers is because it would prepare the students for the workforce. If students had the choice of what summer project to do it would not prepare them for the workforce. For example, if Generic_Name has a job at the local Burger King, and his boss says "clean the grill"

he has to do it or he will lose his job. If the summer projects are teacher-assigned Generic_Name would be used to being assigned a responsibility. It is obvious that the summer projects should be a teachers decision instead of allowing the students to decide their own summer project.

Lastly, the last reason why teachers should assign the summer projects is because it will give the student constant interactions with the material for the upcoming school year. If the students have the choice on their own summer projects it would not help them with the upcoming semester. With the teacher-assigned summer projects the students would know what to prepare for in the upcoming year, and have an idea of what they're learning. For example, if Generic_Name choose her own project should would not have any idea what she would be learning that upcoming semester. However, if her teachers assigned her project she would have an idea of what she would be learning. One can easily see that allowing the teachers to assign the students projects that it would be more beneficial.

Others would argue that the students should chose their own projects because they could pick something they enjoy,it builds responsibility, and it teaches the students how to make their own decisions. However, the teacher-assigned summer projects are more effective. The students summer projects should be assigned by the teachers because it prepares them for the upcoming year, prepares them for the workforce, and it has the students in constant interactions with the material for the upcoming semester. If students pick their own summer projects they will struggle during their next school year, so call your local school board, and sign the petition for the teacher-assigned summer projects.
