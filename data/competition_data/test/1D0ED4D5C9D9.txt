Dear principal ,

Students should be able to brig their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I understand that you may conceder the opposite idea , but you should be able to trust your students. As they get older and older even if phones were to be prohibited, it wouldn't work anyways. Our school is a democracy.

Your students and my classmates should have the choice of weather they desire to carry and use there property on their own time. You should have enough trust in them to believe that during the time that they are luring to become successful they will not use there cell phones in class. If they would decide to go against this policy, the teacher should just be able to take the students phone away either until the end of the day or until the end of class. If you school is such a democracy then the students should have a word on what you decide.

Also , if propitiation hasn't worked in your experience, then it probably won't work in the future either. When the people that make up your school are all deceiving a rule it is usually because they will take the risk to get what they want. There are too many students that are using there phones during free time anyways to have it become a rule to not use them. Not allowing students to use their phones on their own time would be overly dramatic and would not make much of a change.

Lastly, students also need to be able to have some type of communication with their friends and family. If they wouldn't have this, many of them would probably be in a bad mood or just think about other situations while they are supposed to be learning in class. Having their cell phone during free hours is a way for them to have a brake and just free their mind for the remaining time until class starts again. If phones were not aloud in this school then teenagers would have more anger bottled up and they would feel like they were having much longer and stressfully days then usual.

I understand why you would consider starting a new policy, but our students are trust worthy enough to have there phones during the day. If the policy of not being able to have there phones during school would be passed, then there would be much of a difference enyways. Students would still use there phones secretly. Lastly, students need to be able to have a brake between classes considering all the work they are doing to become successful. Prohibiting phones would be unusual and unfair to the students of our school.

Thank You.
