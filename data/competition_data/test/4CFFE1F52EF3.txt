hello the face on mars is just a nautral land mark. Personally I don't belive in aliens , I don't think that aleins made that face on Mars. Do you guys see in pargraph 7 thousands of people were waiting for that alein moment and what did they get nothing . In the last parogrph of the story it said that it shows that the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa , that is a common landform in the american west . he says that it reminds him of the middle Bette in the Snake River plain of idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars that what Garvin says .

Here is more resons why I think why that it is just a nautral landform. Mars has now water all the water the is there is all traped in the ice so how are the aliens actually geting a drink plus what about the temputers they must be freezing so would you want to live there. If there was any civilition then way havn't we seen any aleins there there is no phisical eveidence that there is any there. so you can believe on anything you want but i hope you make the right choice and agree with me.
