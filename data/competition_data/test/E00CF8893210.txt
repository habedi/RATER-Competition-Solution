Dear Principal,

I understand that in today's society, it is very important for students to perform community service. Community service teaches students to care for their community and encourages them to contribute to society. However, I do not believe that community service should be required, for many students just don't have the time to perform these services. Furthermore, if community service is made a requirement, many students may complete a sloppy community service, for they don't want to do it and have forced to. Although compulsory community service is a wonderful idea, it may not be convenient or satisfying for students.

For many students, time is of essence. From sports and clubs to other extracurricular activities, students just don't have the time to perform community service. Harvard statistics have shown that over 80 percent of students have less than an hour of free time a day. If community service is made a requirement, not only would students have to crunch their time to do it, but they will be sacrificing other activities for it. Is it fair to take away student's extracurricular activities just to do community service? Furthermore, community service would just be an onerous task to complete for students who don't have any free time at all. Community service would then take away the little time they have to relax with their friends or spend time with their family. As you can see, many students just don't have the time to perform community service, which is just one reason why students shouldn't be required to perform community service.

Whenever people really don't want to do something, they oftentimes don't put their time and effort into doing it. That is what would happen if community service is required. Students forced into performing community service would not only perform it sloppily, but will also not learn anything from it. The whole idea of community service is to encourage people to contribute to society and help others. With compulsory community service, students will not learn any of these important, life-long lessons. If student's don't get anything out of performing the service, then why even do it? Furthermore, a Yale statistic has shown that by leaving community service optional, 50 percent more students actually put the time and effort into doing it. By leaving community service optional, students will be encouraged to perform the service with their full effort and learn important, life-long lessons.

Community service is a wonderful experience that teaches students to care for others and contribute to society. However, if community service is required for students, the students will not only perform the service sloppily, but will also not get anything out of it. What is the point of performing community service if you don't enjoy it and learn something from it? Furthermore, many students just don't have the time to perform community service. As you can see, compulsory community service isn't a good idea, in the interest of teaching students life-long lessons and caring for others. I know you will make the right choice and not make service a requirement for students.

Sincerely,
