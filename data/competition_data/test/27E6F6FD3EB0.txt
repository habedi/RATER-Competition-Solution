Dear Principal,

After school or during school activities like basketball, soccer, volleyball, track, wrestling and others, are basically what kids want. Taking that privilege away can hurt them not only emotionally, but physically as well. Kids are very active, hyper and full of energy. Running it off will cool them down, and make them feel good about themselves as a person.

A B average is a lot to ask for in a student. Especially the one who can hardly get a C average, which is passing. If C is a passing grade, why higher the expectation? You can even graduate from high school with straight D's. If you can graduate with D's, what's so wrong with a C? They're not the greatest grade you can get, but it's most definetly passing.

Some kids might even only want to go to school for sports. Because you can do something you love, and maybe even get a scholarship for it. If you practice hard enough and get good at it, you can achieve it. Taking this away from students won't help at all, it can actually possible make things worse for not just one student, but multiple. Some parents might even count on their kids to get a scholarship for a sport, because they struggle academically. Or maybe, just because their parents played sports.

Canceling sports for people who may "academically struggle" [not getting a B average], is pointless. If you as a child loved something, let's say a sport. If school was the only place you could play that sport, then it was all of a sudden canceled. How would you feel? Wouldn't you feel kind of bummed? I think so. That's how everyone who plays sports feel. Maybe it's for the better, maybe not. Maybe it will encourage the students to give extra effort to their grades, maybe it won't.

With whatever you do, think of how many students do get a B average. Good for them, they'll get to be able to stay in that activity, no worries for them. But then, think of all the students who don't. Good luck with your choice, hope it works out for the best.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
