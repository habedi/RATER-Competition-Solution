"UGH," groaned Generic_Name. "What happened?" asked Generic_Name "I have nothing to do after school,"

said Generic_Name. "Don't you have any clubs or sports after school," said Generic_Name. "Nope," said Generic_Name. "Well do you have any homework?" asked Generic_Name. "Maybe..." said Generic_Name. "So you have homework," said Generic_Name. "Fine! I have a lot of homework, but I don't want to do any of it," said Generic_Name. "You know, you could always join the homework club,"said Generic_Name. "Whats that?" asked Generic_Name. "Its an after school club where you finish your homework, missing assignments and more," said Generic_Name. "That seems like it could help me a lot. I guess I'll try it out," said Generic_Name. The benefits of joining the homework club are being more cooperative in class, finishing any homework, and helping other students.

Firstly, Students would be more cooperative in class. They would be more cooperative because they are finishing their work in the homework club. They would more likely understand whats going on in class, because they got help on what they were confused on. For Example, My best friend Generic_Name just started going to the homework club. Ever since she started going, Shes been more focused/cooperative in class. The club helped her become more engaged in class. For Instance, My cousin never focused well in class, so he went to homework club. Now he is more cooperative in class because he understands the things he was confused about. The club helped him understand better, and when he understood better, he become more focused in class.

Next, Students would finish their homework. Sometimes students might have a lot of homework or missing assignments, so they procrastinate and don't finish their work. By not finishing their work, their grades start to decrease. For Example, I procrastinate a lot because of the amount of homework or assignments I get. I started homework club a month ago, and I have been finishing all of my homework and assignments. I started to procrastinate less. Another Example, My friend Generic_Name never did her homework. Her grades are were really bad, so she joined the club and now she is carefree. She is carefree because she finishes her work in the homework club and she doesn't have to worry about it.

Finally, Students can help other students. They can help because they might have already learned the same thing as the other student and might help them understand it better. For Example, When I was at homework club, a girl two years younger than me needed help with her math homework. She didn't understand her homework, so I helped her because I understood the homework. Helping people with the things they are confused in makes you a leader. It makes you a leader, because you are the person guiding them through. For Instance, My friend Generic_Name didn't know what to do in her project, so her classmate that went to homework club with her, helped her with the project. He knew how to do the project, so he helped her. Helping other people could also help you with your social skills because you are communicating with other students. You are communicating with the other person and helping them, which plays a role in your social skills, especially in the future when you have a job.

"OMG!" exclaimed Generic_Name, "I can't believe it!". "What Happened?" asked Generic_Name. "I have an A+ in all my classes!" said Generic_Name. "Congratulations!" said Generic_Name. "Thank you! It took a lot of hard work and patience," said Generic_Name. "Really, what did you do?" asked Generic_Name. "Well I joined the homework club like you said," said Generic_Name. "Thats wonderful," said Generic_Name. "I finished my homework, missing assignments, and I understand the things I was confused in," said Generic_Name. "Thats cool," said Generic_Name. "I met a lot of new people there, and I helped them to," said Generic_Name. "I also stopped procrastinating like I used to. I learned this cool trick on how to stop procrastinating," said Generic_Name proudly. "I'm so happy for you!" said Generic_Name. Being more cooperative in class,finishing any missing assignments, and helping other students are all benefits of joining the homework club.
