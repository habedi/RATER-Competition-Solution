Driverless cars would be expensive with all of those sensors? Also not every one is going to have a diverless car so if a accident happens will the person with the car that has a driver have the fault for it? Driverless cars are maybe coming but will every one allow it to happen.

I think how cars right now are fine they make it easier for us while on the road with safty and other things. Sensors are expensive period but a lot of sensors on one car, Cars now are expensive enough already. How much will they cost while being driverless.

Also cars are fast and slow, what kind of cares will be driverless. Will there be driverless racecars and semi trucks with heavy loads be next on the list?

Now talking about people with and without driverless cars. Let's say two cars are on the same road heading toards each other on a sharp turn. One care has a driver and one has no driver. The driverless car hits the car with the driver. So will the driver of the non driverless car be at fault for the accident. And gets all the bills. Or will the person or manufacture of the driverless car get the fault as the article says. If the manufacture is at fault the company would have to recall all of models of that car after a certin amount of accidents with those models of vehicles.

When driverless cars come we have to be prepared for it, everyone will. The Drivers, Manufacturers, Law makers, and other drivers without the driverless cars. So do you think driverless cars should come in to play?
