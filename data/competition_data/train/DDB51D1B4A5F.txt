I don't think that you should make students do community service. I have some reasons on why you should not make us. Those hours of community service could be spent doing homework or studying. 
1. They can be taught, yes, but if you are trying to do something nice, it should be a kind act on your own. 
3. If you graciously take time out of your own day on purpose to help others, then you are doing a very kind act. If you are doing it because someone told you to, it has no meaning. It is just a chore. Actions without meaning do nothing. 
2. Someone who does sports barely has enough time to get their stuff done as it is. Let alone adding some more hours to that of being away from your homework. Some people might have other things in their life that takes up plenty of time. Someone with broken bones needs physical therapy. Some people might have parents who are split up, and they only get to spend time with one of the parents for a little each week. Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard that you were deciding on whether we should or shouldn't do community service as a requirement. People who don't do community service will find it hard because they have never done it before.
