You may not even have enough people for a team ! More students would feel stressed out because they would always try to do better so they could play a sport . by making people not follow there dream or passion would really hurt them. Just let everyone play . It would be a better school . Plus you wouldn't have depressed kids wishing they were on the team . You should come up with a better policy that all students would like . Or at least most of them would like .

And don't make it about sports cause that would be a bad idea. I think that the policy is stupid. Many students love sports and some could have learning disabilities . By you saying that you wont let them play a sport is horrible. To some kids sports is everything to them . It is what they love. If you take that away from them then you are taking away there dream or passion for that sport. You make not think it is a big deal for students but it is HUGE deal . A lot of kids don't get a grade B average. It would be great but they don't . Many have a C average and that's good enough. 
By you . Plus the only way they can get away from it is from sports Being smart or doing good in school is a good thing but being healthy is even better for you saying that you wont let anyone but B average kids is wrong .

.

Not that many people have a B average so not that many people would be able to play sports nd Many students hate there life at home kids need to do physical activity to stay healthy Did you ever think that maybe some students have a hard time at home ? Yeah i don't think so cause then otherwise you wouldn't be needing this policy ome on don't u want a great school full of happy kids and not having kids hate you ?

I'm pretty sure you do .

Hopefully after reading this you will understand that having the B average was a bad idea .
