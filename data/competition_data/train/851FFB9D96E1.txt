you can play in sports your whole life but smartness waits for no one and also if the students really think about it when they graduate from high school with a C average they will realize that they barely past the twelfth grade but if they come out with a B or an A average they would know that they can do anything they put their mines to and also know who was on their tails that made them get those good grades and they would be accepted to any college they wanted to go to. And plus I believe if you made this decision final they would work harder instead of just settling because I believe we are all smart enough to make at least a B average because to me a C average is close to failing and that tells me that I am not applying myself like I should and if that means not playing any sports tell I get my grades up than I think that's a great idea because academics come first before anything and I do believe if you make this decision final students will start applying themselves and doing better. and students don't apply themselves as often as they should and the reason why is because I agree with your decision Dear Principle,

with a C average you wouldn't be able to get into a great college
