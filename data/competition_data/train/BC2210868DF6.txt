. So If people that had to leave because something bad happened to them or a family member that would not be fair to them o i think they should still be able to participate in sports or other activity's still unless once again if it's a D or below. I think it is unacceptable to have a below C average because i think that just means there not there for education there just at school for friends and other things that are not educated. y opinion is that I think its not fair because some people have a hard time with concentrating in certain classes.

I think it should be a D and below to not be able to play in sports or other activity's. if my principle changed the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activity's unless they have a B average then that would not be right at all.
