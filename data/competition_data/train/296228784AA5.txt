If they spend their whole life not doing anything productive, they won't be very strong and if somebody asks that kid to lift something up, they may not be able to do it. That is why I think that the principal is right and that we should let kids play extracurricular activities. It may help the future generation of kids. Kids that play those type of games may think that all that stuff is normal and become violent. They may start to say bad things or destroy stuff. If we let them play many different activities, they they may develop teamwork skills and make friends. 
Since I already talked about the second reason why kids should takes part in activities, lets take about the last reason. Some movies, videos, and video games are very violent like Call of Duty or GTA. 
The first reason why kids should take part in extracurricular activities is because if they just play video games and watch videos on YouTube, Disney+, Netflix, or Hulu, they could get lazy and depend on somebody else to do things for him. This also ties in to the fact that I said that they wouldn't be fit or strong. maybe become very violent. and we wouldn't be strong If kids just stay inside and play video games or watch videos on YouTube or Disney+, we could grow up to be dependent on other people Students should take part in extracurricular activities. Do your kids only want to stay inside and play video games? I know that I would love to do that, but the principal thinks that us students should partake in a extracurricular activities. I don't like the idea of that, but he is right.
