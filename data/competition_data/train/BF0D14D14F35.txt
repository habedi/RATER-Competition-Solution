mainly because i believe this because most of the students in our school don't have grades as high as a B average. it would be better for the students if want to be on the sports teams, that there average should be at leased a C average. ecause . Also i think that its a bad idea to have a B average instead of a C its good for kids to play sports and keep active, and if they cant reach a B average then they cant play sports then it wouldn't be good for those students Dear, principal

i believe that yes there should be a goal set for students who want to be on sports teams but not as high as a B average. It would be better for the students if they had to reach a C average considering that's what most of the students have. it takes a lot of work for students to reach a B average and they would be paying so much attention toward school work they wont have much time for other activities. I believe that you should have students should have to reach a certain grade if they want to play on sports teams. But i do not think that there averages should be as high as a B average.
