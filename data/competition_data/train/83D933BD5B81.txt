I am writing you this letter regarding your decision on making it mandatory for students to perform community service. I myself think that it is sort of a waste of time, depends on what you are going to be doing. Dear Mr Principal,

Well bottom of the line is that students should be required to do community service, but to cut them some slack u should mandate them to a whole lot of community service so they wont end up furious I don't think that would really bother then that much, but lets say you were to over exaggerate and make then do tons of community service than i would know there reason to be furious. If it is something fun then I'll agree on making it mandatory if i have the time, if not then it is a waste of time. 
If u were to make it mandatory then maybe students might agree if you were too make then do a couple of hours Maybe other students don't think it is but i do because i have many things to do when I get home from school or when i am on break.
