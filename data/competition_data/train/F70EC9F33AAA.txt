Another reason we should not have cell phones is because of texting Texting yes we could text on our free time but what if I have friend who is in Math class while i have free time and suppose that my friend is taking a test today and she asked me if I could text her the answers would it be another form of cheating and cheating on a test is big it would not be right to allow us to bring cell phones when we are going to use them to cheat on our tests. There are many reasons why we should not bring such as a teacher even though we could only use our phones during our free time we could be texting someone in a class room who is learning and trying to focus on the lesson but they can not because some one is texting them. One of the reasons we should not have our cell phones is because we could be distracting someone no one really knows who we could be texting or what we are texting. and These are just some of the reasons why we should not allow cell phone to school even if it is during our free time. There are consequents when we bring our cell phones to school these phones are useful but out side of school but at school what we need them for nothing but distract student from there work. Cell phones we all have them and everyone knows we do. We take to school when we know we should not The school policy I believe we should have is policy 2. our cell phones the distract students
