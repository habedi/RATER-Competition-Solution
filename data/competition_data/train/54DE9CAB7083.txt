I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us a certainty of an outcome and also it avoids run off elections. Hopefully this has convinced you to keep the Electoral College. This is my final reason why I think that we should keep the Electoral College.

But knowing the vote isnt going to effect anything, such as Republicans in Texas or Democrats in California they have less incentive to pay attention to a campaign then to care if there president were to be picked. As stated in Source three paragraph twenty three "this is why voters in Presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote can decide an election.
