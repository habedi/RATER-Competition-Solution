While people still release theories hoping for more evidence of alien life NASA is still investigasting other mysterious evidence that could eventually lead to a real science-fiction dream, maybe an alien apocalypse or an abduction? Theorists can only hope. The NASA experts deny all claims with their factual evidence, which easily combats any Conspiracies on the subject. While the scientists do address the fact that the landform appears as a face, it is only the shadows of an extra-terrestrial mesa. NASA first released the photo of the newly-found 'Face' in 1976. These photos spread very quick, and theorists everywhere published books, movies, and more science fiction entertainment about 'The Face.' NASA new from the start the unusual photo was only of arock fromation similar to buttes and mesas, common landforms in the West Americas Conspiracy Theorists have battled these NASA claims since the image was first released. Very little NASA scientists believe in these Theoretical claims. While it resembled a face, the chances of 'The Face' being an alien artifact is highly unlikely. The NASA discovered face was a mystery to the public.
