I also hope you do not force community service hours on the students. I hope you liked this letter. You could ask the local community if there is anything that they need help with and then they could work on picking up litter or something. 
they should not be forced to do them for whatever reason. 
If the kids already have to much like they have a musical instrument, are doing a sport, or are studying for so many tests We should not be required to do community service hours. 
You could have us sign up to do the hours, but if we don't want to then we don't have to. 
You could also have some kind of reward for doing service hours like an ice cream party, or pizza party.

You could have them go on a field trip somewhere if they do the hours. You could also have the kids decide on a relatively low budget idea. If kids do not want to do them then that is okay, but if they want to or need them for something else you should provide them the opportunity. Dear Principal,
