By having the policy change into having a B average in every class will help the students to feel the pressure into having good grades. it well be good for the student body to know that making good grades will pay off eventually. to become more responsible in life 
In addition changing the policy will make the student body more responsible in life. as well as I think that it is a very good idea to change the policy for athletes to have at least a B average in every subject. Dear Ms. principal

In addition to this By pushing them to have higher grades will give them opportunity to get scholarships to go to college to play their sport and to have a backup plan if they do not become famous athletes in their life. 
Also this will tell they students that everything is important not just the sport or sports that him/or her may play. It will teach to have responsibility to have their assignments done on time. Turn in homework when its due. Thirdly to finish class work in class. All this is very important in school. I think this so because it will give the students more pressure to do well in school If they have the pressure they will pay attention in class, do homework and , improve the schools as well as the students test scores. Making the students smarter and more confident.
