Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I hope that you consider some of things I have mentioned I do believe that education matters and that it is disrespectful when certain people interrupt other students will to learn with distracting actions and behaviors, we are here to learn and I want to learn, but I also believe that we as students should have a few privileges and using cell phones at an appropriate time is one of them. and if cell phones were prohibited on school grounds, most likely there would be more people breaking the rules by using them during inappropriate times. some people may have cell phones for emergencies My reasons being: After thinking over both of the policies over cell phones at school, I honestly believe that policy one is best for SCHOOL_NAME Using phones through passing periods and lunch breaks would not be distracting to our learning environment
