Even some of the teachers are agreeing on my input, they have all signed my partition on lowering the policy. Most of us here at SCHOOL_NAME really do think that you are taking this to far. because we will lose amazing players that make C+ average. It is possible that We will lose a lot of students on our campus as well. I have also taken study on other school websites and most of their sport requirements are high C' s. I think that we should at least discuss this issue with the students who participate with school sports I don't think this new policy is fair This is STUDENT_NAME saying that i think it is ridiculous to change the sports policy to a C average. I have gotten support by this idea from many students who play sports for the school. I have done some studying on most of the student grades and most students at our school are making low C' s - high B' s. Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,
