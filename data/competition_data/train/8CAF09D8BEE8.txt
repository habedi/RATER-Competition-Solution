Some kids make playing sports there plan a an b but not for me. some kids depend on sports or extra curricular activities to much. nd by me saying that just basically says also think that but i think its not .This policy may can change a kid or may break one. I think it make's the youth that attends this school with me more determined but they might not see it but I do . Considering changing school's policy so that students may NOT participate in other sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. But some kids just cant live up to that challenge Dear, TEACHER_NAME

really wanted to touch on the new upcoming policy that you might make finale about sports and other activities. Some may think that this policy is a burdened I want to be a lawyer and because of a goal that high I have to do good in school.

I also play on the girls basket ball team and we do have to be eligible to play in the games so I highly agree with this new policy .
