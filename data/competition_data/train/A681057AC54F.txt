My last reason is becasue with the 3D high-resolution images from NASA's MGS it shows that it was just a mesa. Those were all my reasons why I think it was a natural landform not an alien One of my other reasons why is becasue we thought it was just a Martian mesa, witch are very common in Cydonia. Secondly, on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of Cydonia for the first time all they saw was just a natural landform I will be giving you at least 4 reasons why that's my conclusion. After you have listened to my reasons hopefully you will then think the same.

I think that the Face they saw in 1976 was just a natural landform My first reason why I think it was just a natural landform is becasue first of all I am a scientist and I'm not suppose to think aliens and that kind of stuff exist
