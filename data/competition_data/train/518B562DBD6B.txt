It's better for the country that we don't change The Electoral College So far The Electoral College has kept this country great with its voting way for President and Vice President. Changing The Electoral College will break its original way of the Constitutional compromise between the election of President and Congress. The original way is what made this country the way it is today. If we change The Electoral College , we could be changing the coountry. Sure people argued over The Electoral College in 2000 , but that was 15 years ago I would want you to keep The Electoral College the same for its been up to Congress and popular votes from the citizens to elect the President and Vice President all this time. If we change The Electoral College , we might end up having to change a few more things. Dear State Senator
