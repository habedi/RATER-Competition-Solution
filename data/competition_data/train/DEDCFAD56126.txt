This is why i believe Community service should be required. It also shows skills that they didn't think they were capable to do. Dear Principal,

Some people think that community service is a waste of time but they don't know how fulfilled you feel after you help. 
Many people think its a waste of time With friends that you trust on your side you can conquer anything. This also can help you conquer fears. You can work at a soup kitchen at lunch or set up fund raisers for people with special needs. All people are entitled to an opinion You don't always have to give your life up to community service. You can meet people that are interested in the same things you are. Community service also builds life long friendships It can look good on college and job applications. If you wanted to be a teacher, you could go to a local elementary school to read or tutor children of all ages. It tells people that your dedicated to your job. Little things like this can do wonders. 
but they don't know how it can change your outlook on life. My opinion is that community service should be required. It also shows many people that their lucky not to be living in homeless shelter or begging for food on the streets. It makes them think twice before taking everything for themselves.
