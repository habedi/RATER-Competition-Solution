Thank you for your time, a student at your school who hopes for 'Policy 1' Scenario 2:

Now do this. You're at lunch, when you remember you forgot your math homework , and you can't have three missing assignments. But you also know the teacher won't let you call your guardian. Now a guardian needs to call a kid to tell them to ride the bus, not wait to be picked up. Now it reflects poorly on the school, because now the student has a bad grade. Something that I believe could have been avoided, but only if we accept 'Policy 1'. But if not, those scenario's, and ones like it will continue to happen. And to take it's effect on our school. Something no one wants to happen! See how the detention, and the humiliation could have been avoided Then, the unthinkable! He say's "No." Now you're in of class, teacher asks to see your homework. You reply. "I left it at home." and you get slapped with a detention! So if we had 'Policy 2', you'd run up to the teacher at the podium; and ask to call your guardian. you're happy because the teachers THRILLED you don't have three missing assignments! So if we had 'Policy 1' the you would take out your cell phone, call your guardian, and get your homework! Scenario 1:

During lunch, you remember you forgot your math homework, and you can't have three missing assignments. But you also know the teacher won't let you call your guardian. Continue reading to learn why.

I also believe it would be an advantage to guardians as well. That is why I believe that 'Policy 1' would be the best for students I believe that the cell phone policy should be changed for the better. Dear TEACHER_NAME

They could call the office, but I work at the office, and I know how something's get messed up in translation! So the parent calls the student at lunch time.

Student's happy, guardian's happy, school's happy! Now why wouldn't we want the guardian, AND the kid, AND the school to be happy?
