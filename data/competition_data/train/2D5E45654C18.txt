You have the best food out there too You guys do should go to camps like these there very fun. . I went to a program kinda like this before and rode big horses and fished and rode boats. I got to playin the mud and it was funny and felt really weird. I went in swamps and saw some gators but nun in bad. I even got to see my uncle PROPER_NAME deer is cow out of the farm. Haha it was so funny You will have lots of fun and get to do rodeo on some cows yeha. You can ride those big horses and go really fast. you can have a lot of fun. because These people travel for long time at time sol you'll be there for awhile.  There al;so pools and ponds and stuff that you can have fun in. I really think you will want to go to that camp with the Cowboys. It will be really great and you get to ride horses and eat amazing food and sleep in a cabin. If you love to camp and go crazy then this is where you need to come. The Seagoing Cowboys. I gerinte you will have fun Don't worry though because it be extra warm in there. I enjoyed the last time I slept in a cabin. I slept a few nights and then one night I heard monster creeping on me and I peed down my leg. Fish, crab, spaghetti , gators, rabbits, squarles, and shrimp. That food is the best food in the world. You can eat anywhere you like. Bring your friends family anyone and enjoy that great food. Oh almost forgot you can bring your sleeping bags, tint, pillows, blanking, or whatever, you gone be sleepin in cabin. ecause I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program,
