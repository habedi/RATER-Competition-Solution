When your taking a test its about what your thinking not how your feeling. Your not going to have a smile on your face if your thinking about the year J.F.K was shot are you? and when you are reading an article in class its rare that its funny or sad.

Usaly there about politics or a historical person. You are not going to show to much emotion when reading those. That is why I think that this would be pointless to use in a classroom. This is pointless because we dont do things that provoke emotion. We read article, take test, and wright. taking test,
