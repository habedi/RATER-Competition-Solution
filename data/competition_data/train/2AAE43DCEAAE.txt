they have that information that others brought up, so the next time they are buying something similar they can think back to that. Compared to others who ask for others help on a decision so they dont regret it. when people ask for help they get more than one point of view on their decision to make. Also Another reason is in the future when you are saving for another thing . You can use your prior knowledge to help sway your decision. On whether to buy the thing you want or not. I personally used this on my trip in new York when I was buying a gift for my brother. So using prior knowledge form others can help you get to a decision. 
I had this old bike where my knees touched the handle bars and the seat would move around on. When I was saving for a new bike I wanted a nice one I saved for a year and a half. I had all that time to ask my parents as well as my friends if a new bike would be a good idea. They convinced me that a new bike would be a good option and i'm happy with it. In other words listening to others may help you get to a decision you were unsure with. You ever buy something you want as soon as you see it and you regretÂ it later. While to many people impulse buying is fun. while buying things from a rubber ducky to a bike can is fun its always good to check what others think so you dont regret it later.
