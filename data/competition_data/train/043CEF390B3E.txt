Students would benefit from being able to attend to classes from home, with the online classes. and Being in bed while students do they work is great; You can do online classes from anywhere. Online classes are more beneficial than home classes; Home classes are with a teacher or a parent, home classes you have to do the work right then and there.

They can wake up at any time and not a school scheduled time to do their work. Instead of the moving, getting dressed, to do they work at school; They can just do it when they wake up.

Turning in your work whenever you want is amazing. Students can do their work while they're on a road trip or something.
