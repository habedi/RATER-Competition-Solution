The only benefit of this policy is that it would motivate people with lower grades than a B average to do better in school This policy is going to create some problems similar to that problem. I am against this policy because some people want to participate in sports or activities but they wouldn't be able to with a C average. Some sports need a large number of people, for example wrestling needs a large amount of teammates I think this policy is going to affect how much people are going to be in sports and other activities Dear Principle,

They might oppose it for the same reasons why I oppose this policy. People that don't play sports or do other activities wouldn't be affected by this policy. I think most students would oppose this policy also. Especially students with a grade lower than a B average. People that want to play sports would either have to keep a B average or do better in school. It would be another thing students have to do, these are the reasons why I am against this policy.
