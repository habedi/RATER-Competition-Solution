I know that this is just my opinion though. You all have the rights to your opinons as well. I think that the "Face on Mars" is just a naturual landform. I think that it is unlogical to say that Aliens created that face Okay so, if the "Face on Mars" was really created by aliens, why would there be absolutley no evidence of the aliens creating it? How come it has only appeared in books and magazines? Im just curious. I do believe that the "Face on Mars" has always been there and is a naturual landform. I'm going to give you a few reasons as to why I think that. What do you say?
