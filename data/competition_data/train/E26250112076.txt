When students are doing community service, they could build houses for homeless people to live in. The students should want to help the community. Such as do things for the elderly people, shoveling snow, or mowing peoples lawns. If the students do community service, then I believe it will keep them from doing bad or dangerous things. If a student is always busy doing stuff that will help others they do not have time to go smoke, drink, or anything else that is bad.

Although if they were out running around doing stuff they think would be alright, there is more of a chance of them doing something bad. Another reason, if students do community service, their will be more of a job opportunity if they add community service in their interview with the boss. I believe that students should be able to do community service for several reasons. If there is community service going on then we will have an overall better community to be living in. Dear Principal,
