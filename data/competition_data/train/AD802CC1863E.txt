Some people may say, students won't benefit from being able to attend class at home. The kids can get distracted and won't get any work done, because they ether on their phone or sleep. Some people may say online classes are better for them and their kids The kids would fight outside of school instead of at school Third, there will be less fights at public schools. at school you have friends trying to talk to you and it get you off track and the classroom maybe loud and you can't focus. Me personally I an't focusÂ when the class is loud and I have friends in the class. Second, it's a less of a distraction Because at school teachers have to attend to other students. When i'm at school and i need extra help the teacher can't stay and just help me because she have to attend to other kids in the classroom. 
There for, iI think students would benefit from being able to attend class at home. First, some kids learn better when they are one on one with the teacher. I think students would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes at home.
