My opinion on this thought of your's is a brilliant idea I really want to help out. I have spoken to a few of the students telling them that it would be great for our environment and community it can make a big difference. disapprove because they all think its a waste of time and they have better things to do. They Dear, SCHOOL_NAME Principle

I am writing this letter to you to inform you that some of the students at school are not liking you' r idea of community service.
