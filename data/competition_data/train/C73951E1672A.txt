ersonally, Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some people agree, while others don't. Those were just a few things I could think of when t came down to the thought of this new rule. I bet people not wanting to, people having jobs, and people that are busy, are the top 3 reasons people couldn't do these extra curricular activities. The principal shouldn't force anyone to do something. In conclusion, students should NOT have to do any extra curricular activities. Things like chores are a problem when it comes down to this. Some people have 5 - 10 chores to do every day! Well, some people live on like a farm and have to do them every day with no excuses. Personally, this isn't a problem towards me, because I haven't gotten any chores for over a YEAR now! they could have jobs after school or Maybe some students don't want to Some students don't want to do extra curricular activities just because they don't want to do it. I disagree with this statement. Maybe they have friends that have home-school and need someone to hang out with. Some students don't want to do extra curricular activities because they just want to go home. Those students do not want to do these activities and just go home. That is my personal reason why I disagree with the principal. People can get stressed out from things like school and just want to go home. 
Few, but some students have after school jobs they do to earn money. Some students could be working so they could get a paycheck to maybe pay someone back, or to use it as their lunch money. I work with my Dad sometimes after school, and when I do, I get paid very well. Now if you earned money by, say playing Football, thats a completely different story. 
Not a lot, but some people are always busy, and don't have time in their life to devote to an extra curricular activity or two. are always busy.
