There will be more stuff we can put in the recycling bin instead of throwing it away we can renew it save on killing in trees that we killing in rainforest. animals in water will not die if we don't throw things in sewers. I think this because it help out our country. We will have less trash all over the streets. I think that all students should do community. Dear Principal;

We should help some adults The senior citizens might would like to talk to some young kids every once in a while. We can go to the elderly hospital and help the workers with their jobs. If we tutor little elementary kids that will help them improve their grades better in their classroom. If we watch parents kids for them that will save time them.
