Then there will have to be parents involved too. Well that's all my opinion on this matter. If I gave you some ideas then perfect. But if not then i guess i gave it my best shot. Well, whatever you do is up to you How about you hold a vote? Then you can see some willing participants. You could also send home a question form for the parents to find out their point of view. Either way you may end up with a few people that will agree with you. You would need their permission for their kids to do community service. Dear principle,

I disagree with your idea to require students to participate in community services. In my opinion we should have a choice in those sorts of things. Not only that but, what about homework, family, and other school or home related activities? There are some up sides to that idea and i understand that it would help the environment and make the neighborhood look a lot better. But, what about what the children want? it would be best to allow the students themselves choose what they want to do. I'm positive that there are some students that may want to do that and that is great. Let those individuals choose what they would like to do. For example, someone might need some extra credit and they could do the community service to earn that. Another idea is to make that an extra activity like sports or band. When would the students have time for the community service? Would it be during or after school? In my point of view either way would be interfering with either grades or home. 
I'm sure that a majority of the student body will agree with me on these matters. I'm just saying
