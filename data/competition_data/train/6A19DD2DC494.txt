Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Cell phone use while driving statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. According to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk. PHONES & DRIVING


Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel compelled to answer a parent's call if received while driving.                     Parents should also avoid calling their teen when he or she is driving. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving.
