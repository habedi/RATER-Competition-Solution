"Hi, I'm Luke I am a Seagoing Cowboy!!!!"said Luke to the other towns people.

The people begin to walk away from the crowd with people yelling and shouting to Luke how boring he is and quiet. Luke felt bad because of this so he started to talk again.

"People listen up, I am here to make a statement. That would be why I called everyone here today."

Someone shouts from the crowd. "Get on with it little boy this taking up some of our presious time!!!!"
