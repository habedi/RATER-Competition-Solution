if the student is allowed to choose what he or she wants to do for their project, then they will be more motivated to do it and enjoy Summer. In conclusion, students want to enjoy summer and do something they love, not be assigned a project that the teacher decides is "a good match" for the student. So if students have to do a project over Summer, then they should at least be able to choose what that project is about and how to go about it. Summer is supposed to be fun! Having a teacher assign you a project to do over the summer is the last thing that any student wants. 
If a student chooses to do something their interested in for their project, then they will be more likely to do it. Therefore, Summer is supposed to be fun, not full of busy work It could be something super exiting and new! However, if a teacher were to assignÂ the project, then the student will feel more like he or she is stuck with a boring assignment for all summer. 
nd lastly, Teachers cannot create a project for everyone,someone is going to be, inevitably, left with a boring, soul sucking project. It makes the student interested in what their objective. Lastly, irst off, This also lowers the chance that they will actually do it and get it done, not only on time, but with quality work. 
This makes them feel like all they have to do is busy work and cannot go out and enjoy their childhood. If the student at least gets to choose to do something that he or she likes, then it is way more likely that the student will actually choose to do that project. They will not feel like it's busy work, but an excuse to go do something that they love to do and share it at school next year. 
econdly, Teachers have to appeal to the majority of students, so odds are that there will be a handful of students that will be stuck with a life draining project that they hate. Summer projects should be designed by students for many reasons.
