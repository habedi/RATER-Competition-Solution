if you make the students do community service I am sure many people will be unhappy. Students should not be required to do community service because it will be a conflict with their extracurricular and sports activities. It is not justified to make them do community service because you think they should and you are the principle. People will be unhappy with your decision if you go through with this. Requiring students to do community service also goes against human rights, nobody is able to make them do community service. some families may even move out of the school district because of this. The students would be unhappy with this decision and maybe some parents would too. This would cause the school to have unpleasant school days, knowing they will have to do community service when they get home. Students should not have to do community service because it is the students time and it should be up to them on how they should use it. Dear principle,

Athletes will have to cut practices short because they have to do community service, thus for not allowing them to become better at their sport. Students should not be required to perform community service.
