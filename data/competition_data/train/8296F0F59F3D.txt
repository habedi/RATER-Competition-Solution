I believe that you should leave our school policy how it is. 
Lastly, Dear Principle,

Any student who has less than a grade B average will feel left out. Also, over half of our school would get less exercise and will not go outside at all. Plus, these students will not be able to hang out with their smarter friends because they will be at practice or at games all the time. And, finally, there would be hardly any team mates for our sports There are many good reasons to do so. First the students will then want to go to a different school. All of the school athletes will have too low of a grade to participate. This will cause our teams to be horrible. Then, in games, the teams will not be able to play because there will be hardly any players. 
To start off with, the teams will have close to no players most kids don't have a grade B average. most of the students have a Grade C average Next, the students will want to go to other schools 
Second, Most other schools may not have this policy. Slowly our school will get smaller and smaller. We will not be able to afford team sports, clubs, or any other extra-curricular activities. Not to speak of buses or renaissance rallies.
