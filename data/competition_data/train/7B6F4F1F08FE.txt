I think people consult more than one person for advice.Â  and that is why, these are the reasons why people seek multiple options is, others can have more experience, they could come from different backgrounds, and they could have different view points 
To conclude, With experience comes wisdom, and most people don't have the opportunity to get that experience or wisdom, so they need to get it from people who can have the opportunity to get it. When people have the opportunity to get experience, then they can do that particular thing almost without effort. 
Last of all, if you get advice from people with different experiences, they can tell you different things from the places they have been. Furthermore, people with different backgrounds can give different advice about places or things that come form were they have originated from. If you only consult with one person they could become bias for something, but the same could being against something because they to could also become bias. Having view points that differ from other people, could lead to disagreement, but that could also good because then the person asking for advice can see the different side of the "story". 


To begin with, when people get advice from different view points, they can see all of the pros, as well as the cons. they can have more experience and Having different backgrounds can give the person asking for advice different perspectives about the topic. they can have a different background People sometimes seek multiple opinions because, other people can have different view points Why do people sometimes ask more than one person for advice.
