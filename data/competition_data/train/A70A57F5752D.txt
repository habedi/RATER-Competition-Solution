The way we can give back is in the form of community service. Friends working together makes time go fast and before you know it your doing community service for fun. Dear Principal,

Some may feel that community service like tutoring young children or picking up garbage on the side of the road is taking away from what they need to do like play video games. But our earth needs it. She gave so much to us we need to give some back. Community service could even be fun it's a good way to meet new people and help out. I think for at least one hour a day students should be required to work it does not even have to be hard work it may be fun work to. helping people gives you a nice feeling inside and I think everyone should feel it. Friends can work together as well, if you really don't like it you don't have to do it but it would be good to.
