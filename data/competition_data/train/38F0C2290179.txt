Dear Senate,

because the winner-take-all system makes it so candidates don't spend time in the states they know their not gonna win. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and you need at least 270 votes to elect the President. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and so many more people think that we should abolish the Electoral College. I think we should change the election by popular vote because with the electoral college not everyone is getting to vote like they should be doing. Im not the only one that thinks this way The Electoral College selects the electors, so the canadates are gonna choose the electors that have things in common with them so they win the election. Voters vote for a slate of electors, they dont get to vote for President. The Electoral College process is so much more complicated and long than popular vote, so why do we still use the Electoral College? We shouldn't. The Electoral College is unfair
