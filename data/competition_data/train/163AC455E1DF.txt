I think attending school would be better. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because theyll charge you for it either way. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are home schooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing thats going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then thats fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. Its the law for every student to go to school or to do something thats related to school. ecause, Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. Youll be able to hear the teacher while shes explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isnt going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment Teachers teach you better and help you out when you dont understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You dont need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well Being home schooled is pretty challenging So in that case In my opinion i think online schooling wont benefit any student i think going to school is better then online class and video conferencing.  you dont have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do.
