Although I support your decision, there is something that is bothering me a little. I think that for those students with a C average is not fair to not be able to enroll in any school activity. In my opinion a C average is not bad. 
My suggestion is the following: Students with an A or B average will definitely be allowed to participate in any kind of school activity.

Students with a C average will be allowed to perform certain activities but not all. If they show improvement then they will be free to enjoy any activity they like. Dear principal

First able i would like to know how you're doing, i hope you're doing well. I consider this idea to be reasonable. I am pleased that you would actually consider this. I am in total favor of this new policy. I have been informed about a new policy in our school. This new policy will require for all student to have at least a grade B average to be able to participate in any sports or other school activities. This may be the start of a perfect end to bad grades and behavior.

Students will start taking school more seriously knowing that there is a reward for them if they do so.
