It might have been important but who knows if your telling the truth. You could listen to music an play games, but that would be all. You shouldn't have your phone in the halls or other free time; just lunch. If you need to make a phone call, you ask the teacher or go to the office. But other than that, no cell phones allowed. If you do have your cell phone out during lunch, you are the only one who could use your cell phone; Your friends may not. If they do not have a phone, well to bad for them. If they start texting in their free time they are going to want to continue their conversation( or whatever they are texting) during class or un-free time. I could agree with both sides, but i strongly agree with policy 2.

Yeah i want my phone out during school, but I don't want to get distracted. But, I'm going to side with policy two. I also believe that if students were allowed to use their cell phones before class, that they might be talking to someone on the phone and be late to class because the conversation was "important." but I just think it would be to much of a distraction. Yeah, it would be nice to use our cell phones, Then they are not paying attention on what is happening in class that day, and will have no clue what to do on their work. If the student is on, or using the cell phone before class, what if they get in an argument with someone and are distracted the whole class period. Why? I think that kids should not have their phones out during school. Policy One- Using your phone during lunch is ok, but you couldn't text, or talk on the phone.
