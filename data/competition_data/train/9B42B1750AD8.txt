People like me can probably do it on weekends just to help others because im always busy during the week. I don't think the principal should make the students clean up litter or do community service In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service or maybe jr high students can help too if there not to busy maybe some of the students that don't play any sports can probably help too. Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary and they probably have time to pick up litter because they might have other thinks to do with their family's. The principals should make the people who act bad during the week and during the weekend that will probably help them change a lot they gonna get tired of picking up litter and doing community service.
