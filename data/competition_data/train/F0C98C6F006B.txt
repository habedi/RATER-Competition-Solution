As you see I think that if you approve that policy it'll really help the school and the students. Many students will do better in class because they'll pay more attention instead of trying to text and pay attention at the same time. I hope you approve this policy, thank you. Students will not be walking and messing with people in the hallways. I think they will go to class and be ready to learn and then they'll get their free time to text or something. and it'll stop students from texting in class Since students know that they've had their time to text I think that they will start acting better They will also stop texting during class because all they want to do is text for like ten minutes and that's it. You won't have to have a lot of phones in the office any more. 
By letting us text students will be much more entertained by their phones and the trouble is gone. Trouble. trouble, trouble. Many students will stop getting in so much trouble. During lunch time a lot of students throw food and mess around with other students. They might talk to friends in school but they also want to text. I think that if you let us text during free time it'll keep us from getting in trouble. We don't have nothing else to do during lunch time except eat and if we text during lunch is not going to affect our learning and there is nothing wrong with that. Students really need a time to socialize and talk to friends. and students will start acting better. Students need a time to text Almost everyone in school has some type of phone. I've seen many students trying to text in class. They are always trying to hide their phones from teachers. By letting us use our cell phones during lunch period and other free times it'll really help. I think that the first policy is better. I really enjoy having my cell phone with me all the time Dear Principal,
