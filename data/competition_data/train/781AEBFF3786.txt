Just because other people do it doesn't mean you have to also. Its fun as some other outdoor activities If you like to hang out with your friends 24/7, this job may not be right for you. If you don't like community service, that's fine, don't do it. Community service should be encouraged, not forced. Not everyone has to like it, but it helps out everyone, even you. You can like or hate community service. So I do not think you should make community service should be required to do. You could probably have something better to do. Maybe you think that just because there is no reward, you don't have to participate. Why you shouldn't have community service: Maybe you think its boring. Just because it isn't fun doesn't mean you cant do it. Even though there is no reward for what is done you feel like you did a great thing for you, your city, and your country. If you like to hang out with friends who are willing to do community service also, this is right for you. It helps out the stray animals out there so they can have a home and be healthy instead of living in a trashy area. Helping the environment is a great thing to do.

If you don't want to do it its fine. Why to have community service: Because you help out the environment. ut these are some examples of why and why not to have community service.
