When the camera took the picture, the shadow of either the camera, or something else, made the Face look like a face. The shadow make the rock look like it has eyes, nose, and a mouth. 
Aliens are not real ans the Face is just a natural landform. The Face just changes overtime. Maybe the Face looks like a face now. If aliens were real, then people would think aliens made everything in space and will come to earth to attack and kill us. Aliens are just a myth. People just belive evrything, and/or watch too much TV shows about aliens. Some people think aliens are not real and some people think aliens are real. The Face on Mars changed after different amount of years. We don't know how it changed and we probably will never know. But every famous attractions change. So the rock could be a natural landform. We don't know why it changes. It's a mystery. No one knows how the face changes, maybe it's aliens, maybe it's natrual to change, maybe it's getting older.
