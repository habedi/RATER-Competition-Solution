Policy two is a better choice they will be to busy to pay attention to a flight of stairs two steps away. because have a cell phone can be extremely distracting to students and maybe even teachers. School is a department of education to learn new things and life long skills. students at school and adults at work can get distracted bye a cell phone. Policy one states, students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and only use them during lunch and passing period but phones have to be turned off during class time. Policy two states, students are not allowed to have cell phones at all which does not just alarm the owner but also the rest of the class. All though you can use them for urgent cares Many kids all over the country talk on cell phones. We use them to communicate with one another. We also use cell phones for emergencies. For example if are out with your friends and you need to talk with one of your parents what do u do? You call them or text them. By picking policy two you have eliminated the disruption for students and have made it easer for students to learn as much as possible. If you decide policy one you might have complaints about cell phones ringing during the middle of class Students also might get hurt texting on a phone Dear Principal,
