hy? maybe there might be someone that they dont like or they dont want to start a fight with person they dont like or They may like an another activity and they may be good at it if the principal would put them in the activity that they do not like they would not do any work. I know if my principalÂ would put me in the activity that i dont like i would ask to see if i could switch to the activity that i do like. nd maybe they are not good at it nd one of their friend's are in volleyball and the other friend is in the yearbook club and what if the friend that is in volleyball may not like volleyball they may like the yearbook club and that other friend that is in the yearbook club that friend may like volleyball I think its an bad idea for the principal to do this and they shouldn't do this I strongly disagree with this idea What if they have a friend that is in a different activity and they want to see them and what if they dont see each that much and hangout that much because other students may not like the activity
