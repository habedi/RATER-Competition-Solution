I agree because all students should do something fun and move around 
In conclusion, They will be appreciated in what they are doing for others and the rest of the students will be happy. thats why I agree, so students can be active during school hours. Some students would rather sit and work with the yearbook. Some just want to help other people in the school. All academics should be for one half of school time and activity the second half. The activities would help students refresh their brains and forget the things they are going through. Most students that play in a team could play the sports that they like. You can start feeling healthy after a game of any sport, and students can enjoy the nature when there outside. I agree because students move around when playing sports Lots of students like art work from the front cover and will want a yearbook Most students would rather sit than play sports, so they can still do something active with the yearbook. All students should at lest do one activity rather than academics. This decision should be allowed if a student wants to do a activity or not. Would you want to participate in a extracurricular activity? Students can serve on students council which helps other students with disorders. Students can help out with yearbooks, as a result they can design the front cover of the year book
