This system has worked for years and it still works to this day. When the people vote they are voting for a slate of electors, and those electors are trusted people. If you don't like the system than you don't have to vote, but you want to vote top help your electors when.

Changing the election by popular vote for the presendent won't change anything. People will find mistakes in that and want a different way to elect people. It's best to leave the system alone before everything goes havoc.Â  The Electoral College is a way for people to vote for who they wan't without others knowing Keeping the Electoral College may make some people mad, but it's something we are all used to. It would take years for us to perfect everythimg for a new voting system. 
but That's why I think we should Keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College was founded by our founding fathers, and it's in the Constitution. There maybe people that think the Electoral College should be taken out and be replaced I strongly disagree. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College. Dear state senator,

It's a part of history and has worked for many years
