Mostly the main reasons on helping the community is to make the people around you feel very helped. You would also feel very appreciated knowing there's people who will also help you back. Which is why; I would rather be helping the community than laying down do nothing when there's something needed to be changed.

Making a charity for the homeless people 
Ex. 3: They could have a better grade if someone offered to tutor to.

Teaching the people who are younger and less knowledgeable will let them know what's going on, or what to do for future use.
