Now the kids that don't have after school activities are the kids that should be doing the community service because it will keep them out of trouble. 
So we leave this decision up to you to decide but An even better idea is to make it mandatory for the kids that do noting after school because those are the kids that end up getting in trouble a lot.

Our school does not have a lot of trouble makers but if you don't start making things mandatory for the kids that do nothing after school besides hangout at the bike shop they will all become trouble makers.

Also the kids that you know that are always getting in trouble on the weekends with the cops they should have the community service if anyone.

If a kid is getting in trouble a lot and then another kid is inisint and has done nothing at all he shouldn't be the one doing community service. Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I play baseball and basketball and i wouldn't want community service interfering with my sports. As much as it will keep kids out of trouble I believe this because it should be whoever wants to do it not you have to do it. 


i strongly believe we all shouldn't have to do community service. but will also take away kids after school activities. I strongly believe that we all shouldn't have to do community service
