Second it looks like it is attached to the ground Yes, we have found flowing water but we have not found any type of living orgamisim. Third, there have been no sign of life on mars First of all th face looks like it was sculpted. It has no body that can be seen Second of all It looks attached to the ground. Unless it is a decatetated head. The land scape couldv'e played an trick on us. I think it's just a landscape trick. It happens all the time. Like the potatoe with a face on it. there has been no sign of life on mars. nd, third f it were a readl head the end outline wouldnt be smoothed in to the ground. It would be laying on top and have a shadow showing the back side the the skull. Do you think the Face on Mars is a legit person or just a landscape? Is it just mother nature pulling tricks on us? So here is why I think that the landscape is playing illousions on us. First, The face looks scultped. Second, It lookes attached to the ground and third, there is no sign of life on mars.
