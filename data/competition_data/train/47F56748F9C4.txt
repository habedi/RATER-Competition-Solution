I don't want to keep the Electoral College I want to have Election by popular vote for the next president. It's my personal oppinion because if one citizen have three or four votes there are so much votes and if all the Electoral College votes for the same candidat. He has got more chances be elected maybe. 
Because if you have a vote who comptabled to more vote than another vote of citizens it's not fair... If you give more votes to a citizenÂ  I think you can have a problem I think it's as better idea because the election are more fairy and the president can look how many people vote for him after, why a citizens cannot have plus votes than a Electoral College why? If you give one vote for one citizens and one vote for all people who leave in United States that's more fairy for the candidat for the Presidential Electoral and for the citizens, 
Dear Senator,

I text you because I want changement for now
