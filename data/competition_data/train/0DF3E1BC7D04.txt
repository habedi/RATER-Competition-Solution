Great effects are it could be fun, healthy, and you could receive extra credit. As kids we should be outside more, be active, and have fun. Sports could also prepare us for future jobs or side activities like hobbies.  It helps you get into certain schools that are tough to be accepted in to. High school specialty programs are tough to be accepted in to but playing sports can help. Also, playing sports looks great on any college resame. Teachers could also have an interest in the sports you play. They might be impressed and agree to have you as a student in their class. It could also be pleasing knowing that sports help you sleep better to be better focused on classwork.

Practicing is exercise by planning and getting ready for everything for the next game you play a game. Games require the most energy of all, for you are doing everything planned but ten times harder.
