dI have heard that you have been wanting to change the school policy about cell phones so i just wanted to give you some ideas. hank you for reading my letter, i hope you take my recommendation of policy number 3. 
But the bad side of policy number 2 is that they would not be able to call there parents after school to pick them up. That way they will not be calling/texting any one during class, and if they are caught with the phone on, they should get it taken away until the end of the day . Then after school they will be able to call someone. So i recommend a policy number 3, which is: students should not be aloud to have phones out during school hours, they should be turned off, but they may take it out after school if they need to call someone. In my opinion, i think policy 1 is not a good idea. Policy number 2 has a good side and a bad side to it. The good side to policy number 2 is that they will not be able to communicate to other students during class time. If students can use phones during lunch periods and other free times they have, they might be taking out there phones in class and calling/texting there friend during class time. A student could be helping another student out during a test through texting ,so i wouldn't recommend policy number 1.
