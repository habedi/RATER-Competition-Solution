. An Of coruse you have some chores and have to clean up after them but it's not really a big deal especially if your a animal lover . n yes I'm a animal lover so that would be amazing . An I love to travel I would love to travel like that . Do you know why You get to see animals and take care of them for a long while . You get on a boat and sail and you get to see serval places , like China , Greece , and Eroupe . Those three are just a few places you get to see and they are absoultly amazing . It gives you a great chance to see the sea To be in the militalry , you have to be very courages and very brave . If you think about it it's really worth it because you are saving lives and thats why most people do it , to help people and to save lives . I think personally that it's worth it I would love to save someones life and do a very courages deed like that , it takes guts . you should join the Seagoing Cowboys it is very dangreous inda because you are in the military but wouldn't you risk it to save others . To be brave , and save a life . I don't know about you but that is a very mobil act . The cons of being a part of Seagoing Cowboys Program is you have to work very hard , you have to do your part . Anthother thing if you get seasick it would be extra challenging , because your on a boat for serval mothes and weeks at a time like luke you could very easly slip and fall and break you ribs . I mean he could of died . It's very dangoues espeically if it rains , because that doesn't help , an the water is very cold so hope you don't fall in . lso
