Luke also wanted to go seasgoing to show his friend how manly he is. Because his friend thought that hhe was scared to do something that is not normal in his life.

So Luke wen't over sea to show his friend he is not afraid. But when Luke is over seas something bad happens. Luke is feeding the animals, and he trips over something and just about fell over board to his death.

Luckly a peace of medal was sticking out the side of the ship and caught Luke before he almost died. Aways be carful when you on a ship traviling. Something bad aways happens. But anways Luke had a friend come along so they could hang out like most friends do.

Luke and his friend was on the ship, and they stopped at a place where the horses and the animals had to get off. Then the boys had to find something to do so where the horses and the animals stayed is where the two kids started to play games like Baseball, Volleyball, Table-Tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling.

So when the two boys were done doing their stuff like playing games they wen't back to their homes, to see their families. But when their time was up off seeing their families they both wen't back to the ship, and said bye to their families for a long time then it was time to go.
