Secondly you can help more kids if this caters to there learning style and personality. On the other hand kid might take advantage of this and skip school put the lessons on then go out and do stuff. They may also just get lazy and relay on the lessons to do work. For an example people who have anxiety in large classrooms they would only see the teacher. If a kid is very disruptive the teacher could make them leave the room and hop on to the stream and watch from a different classroom. there is a lot less pressure to go to school from your parents. This could also help disease control because the sick kid can't infect the others. Those are two key reasons why i'm in favor of long distance learning.

This can also help people with different learning styles and disabilities. If you are sick or late you can listen in to the lessons and keep up Anther use is when a kid is running late and can listen to the lesson on his way to school and know what going on when he gets there. i'm a huge supporter of long distances learning. Thats why Those are the main reasons why i think long distance learning should be an opinion at school all across the states. In summery this can help sick, late and disable students. help teachers with disruptive students and meany more situations, but the only way to see what really happens is to implement it into he school systems.   Have you ever been laying in bed with a fever of 103 and known you where going to fall behind in school over something you had no choice of. First reason I like long distances learning is that when a kid is sick those are small disadvantages for the huge advantages.
