Students wont have the time they have now as students any more if you let them do it and they have do community service when its the weekend when have a day without no one after you about some thing than you get a phone call its for community were you have see kids work when its your day off. You don't wont that to happen do you so you should let the students have to community thing go cause not a lot of people are going to anyway no students is going to give up there weekend for community service You should let the students do it on free well that well make things much east for you are principle you have a lot of things you do. So don't put to much stuff on yourself I think you should let students do community Because if all the students do community service they wont have a lot of time to stay for test that are coming up Dear Principle,
