I don't think students of any school should have to do community service if they don't want to. But I don't think we should have to pick up after other students they should pick up after themselves. I know it is great to help your to but I really don't should have to do communit I understand that if a student have to have some kind of punishment and have to community service What time does all of this starts? Because some students have to be at home at a certain time. And if we had to do it after we got home from playing sports it would be too dark to see how to do anything. I know it is great to help out the community, but we should be able to do it when we want to. Dear principal, What if the students other things to do at home.

Most students at our school play sports after school, and if they are playing spots how are they going to do community service? Community service takes a lot out of the day.
