Education is very important, but the lack of exercising and just eating is what leads to the kids in this world to diabetes, and to unhealthiness. i have to slightly disagree with this decision but strongly disagree with it at the same time. I completely understand your decision Before you make this totally official, i believe that it's in mine and everybody's interest that you pull some kids aside and talk with them about their opinions about this decision. Another thing is that school should be an environment where kids like me can have a fun, safe, learning environment. Dear TEACHER_NAME,


So like i said in the beginning of this letter, It is nothing against your authority, but in my opinion, some people learn slower than others. So for all you know, that students best work could just possibly be "C" work. I must say that i will have to slightly disagree with your decision on the whole sports thing. Now I am not saying that physical education is more important than getting the things that will help us succeed in life. But if the kids that are not doing "C" average work, instead of "B" average work, you are basically telling them that they have no time for exercise, or no time for playing, then the child will just think that he needs to do nothing but school work and not exercise. This will eventually lead to the child being obese. One of the reasons that i protest to this idea of yours, is because kids need to get exercise just as much as we need education.
