secondly we dont even get the chance to vote for a president we get to vote for a slate of electors. In this essay im going to give you my opinion about the electoral college. My first reason is i dont think a few 100 people should pickk the president, i think the entire nation should pick the president. ur votes might not count. Those are my reasons.

and the electoral college says oh well they voted for him so lets pick him, no we vote for slate of electors who vote for whoever the they feel like and sometimes there random people.

Thirdly you votes dont count With only a few hundred electors a rich person could bribe them into choosing who they wanted and it could be someone who got no votes. It is unfair this country has 100s of millions of people and to leave it up to 370 people is proposterus. I dont think a few 100 random citizens should pick the president, i think the people should beccause what if the entire nation votes for one person but, the few 100 people vote for someone else. So overall Bob dole was right abolish the electoral college!       Â  lets just say u live in texas and wanted to vote for for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the state wide election,they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Secondly we dont get to vote for the president
