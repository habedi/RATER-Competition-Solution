It's a wonderful time to help out, volunteer time, and donate. Dear TEACHER_NAME and TEACHER_NAME,

Instead of making community service a requirement, you should create a club with rewards and fun projects that have to do with helping out. I think it would really be worth the time and effort. Why, you might even find your community becoming a better place! Now don't get me wrong, I think community service is a great idea. In my opinion, you shouldn't. I know that you are debating whether students should be required to perform community service. Students enjoy having time on weekends to see friends, go shopping, and visit with family. Most schools have Honor Clubs with students with exceptional grades and characteristics. These students volunteer their time and as a reward they get to go on field trips to amusement parks and other fun places. These are the students who should be helping out in our community. They get to volunteer if they want to and if they don't, it's their loss. I am one of these people and I think helping out in my community is really fun and fulfilling. Their grades would probably drop Although, I don't think many students would be too happy if they were forced to do this. Also, if students had to do community service after school they would have limited time to do homework and study. If you required them to do community service they wouldn't be allowed to do these things
