Dear principal,

I do understand some reasoning for why you want students to have a B average to play sports. Many children, kids, and teens stress at home because of a death in the family, a divorce between parents, or may be their parents are just plain jerks. I feel I am lucky to say none of these go on in my home. why a student may have a C average is because of stress at home. Another reason Personally, I'm not very good with science. The past few years I've been getting C's, and I would have been devastated if i couldn't play the sport I wanted. 
Some students try to depend on sports for getting them jobs or into colleges, so they decide to slack off in subjects. I don't think it's fair that you can't participate in a sport unless you have a B average. ne reason why Although I still believe a B average is too high. A C seems to be much more in the middle of grading a student may have a C average is because it's in a subject they struggle with. A's and B's are the spectacular grades, and D's and F's are the not so spectacular grades, and a C is just in the center.
