And they should do that until each group has done 3 months of community service. I think that if we take time to help the kids they can also learn. 
Some kids should have a month of community service then they should switch off with the kids that were not doing anything. But we should also be able to have fun and hang out with our friends. For all the hard work we did and be able to relax. we should also have fun because were are also still minors. We should all take time out of what we are doing to enjoy ourselves. The kids should also have fun too. So that kids will get good grades in school and so that they can learn how to do it on there own. But kids should also have fun doing it because there not doing it just because there doing it to help other kids out. Dear principal, I think all kids should have specific time doing community service. I think that if we take time and set an good example some day they will grow up and do the same.
