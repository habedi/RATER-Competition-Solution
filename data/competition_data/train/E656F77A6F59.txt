I am confused with the requirement of all students to perform community service. If they don't, they don't have to because we are free to do what we want in this country. Mr. Principal:

There are laws to be followed, but you can't force kids to do community service in school. The kids who don't want to community service will probably not do as much or as good of a job as the kids who actually do want to help out the community. Kids should be able to do what they want to do. If they want to help out the community, great! If community service stays as volunteer-work, then maybe people won't feel as much pressure and will volunteer more than if they are forced to do it! They should choose what they want to do. Who knows, maybe the kids who don't want to help out may change their minds and actually want to do community service some day! Maybe there could be a program for the students who want to do community service. 
Other kids may want to help out a little but not be in the program. 
There could be specific days when they all come together to do something for the community. Others may want to do nothing at all because they think that it is a waste of time.

All of that is fine.

They can do what they want to do. When they are not forced to do something, they won't feel as much pressure to perform the task.

They can just volunteer and not have the pressure.
