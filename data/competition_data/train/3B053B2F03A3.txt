All I'm asking is for us not to do community service hours as much. Maybe two or three a month. Maybe more, but I have a life outside of school as any other person does, and I don't feel like spending that extra time, on the highway picking up trash. That's one of those things that makes me happy, I just wish that I could take a break once in a while. Seeing new people every day, with smiles on their faces, makes a smile on mine. I already have to do chores. Picking up litter or tutoring children, is a plus, and I do it for free. Of course I love helping others 
The stress of sports, studying, homework, and chores get to my head, then I think about how I have to do more hours of work on my free days. Maybe you could cut back the hours some. I'm not asking for a lot, just enough for me to have an off day where I can just sleep, relax, or hang out with my friends.

but I'm also a teen age girl. I like to do stuff with my friends, go to the movies, or mall. Some times I just like to chill at home and not think about the hours I have to do. I enjoy tutoring kids, and picking up trash house, or neighborhood Dear TEACHER_NAME,

The community service that is required for me to do is taking away my free time. If I didn't have to do community service, I could be doing stuff as in work around the I barley get eight hours of sleep anymore. My friends and I have been talking, and we think that the hours are too much With all the sports and homework I do, I barley get to see my friends anymore. I spend my weekdays doing homework and sports, and my weekends doing community service. I was just thinking about how much time I used to have with my friends, and now, I only see them at school.
