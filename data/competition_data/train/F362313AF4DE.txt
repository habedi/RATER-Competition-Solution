To change the school policy, i' m positive we would not exactly have a full team , 75 or above rule helps us all out. It gives our students the time to make up the grade.

. In my opinion I think, what the coaches are doing is fine. 
If we do not meet the requirements we must not play in a game or also have some type of punishment, meaning running extra etc. . Being an athlete is very difficult I have to say that ,I myself an 8th grader disagree, on your new school policy. I've been "A" , "B" honor roll, since kinder. Unlike most parents, my parents care about my education and at the same time they want me to have fun. so ,I became an athlete. TEACHER_NAME, if you must change the policy I promise you, your parents and staff won't be pleased due to this change. My parents have always, told me in order to not be punished to bring home at least a 75 or up. 
If you must change the policy let it be the 75 average or above policy, to Join athletics.

You would still have a great team and successful students. Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Sports have influenced me the most, throughout the school year to keep my grades up. Our coaches here at SCHOOL_NAME, have kept the athletes informed, of some important information. Meaning in order to be an athlete , your grades have to be 75 or above. For the fact that , having a "C" average is better than an "F" average?
