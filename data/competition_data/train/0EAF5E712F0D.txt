Everyones president. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happend in 2000. If you keep the Electoral college you get certainty of out come So your getting back some of what you put in, it is a win win situation I think we should keep the Electoral College Sorry but i dont want a comenest to vote for our president. 
You cant just go back and erase it off the Constitution For one reason is its in our Constitution The electoral college requries a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal The Electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportonmentÂ  of the senate decreed in the constitution No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The other thing is you have to be an qualified citizen. This is my reasons why i would keep the Electoral college you can also avoid run off elections. The Electoral college avoids the oroblems of and election The electoral college can be argued that its method of selecting the president my turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carring there state. Like when Nixion and Clinton both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority in Electoral college.
