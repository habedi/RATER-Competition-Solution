Finaly, but for a class of 30 people it would have to find individual people and measure their mussel movement independently from everyone else. So, this program would not be useful because people would get uncomfortable, the space, cost and proccessing power need to run the program, and individual detection is needed before it can be used for a class room. the actical siad home computers cant handle the complex algorithms, and school computers are old and not as good as most computers at home this would need its own computer to run,
