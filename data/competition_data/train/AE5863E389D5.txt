America is known as the most obeise country in the world and I agree 100%.People would start to buy a bike or start walking which is an exercise for people who are overweight. It would make America loss a lot of weight! There is no reason why the world should keep cars. All it does is create problems , causes many deaths from accidents , causes pollution , causes laziness. I don't want any kids in the future to think life is easy. Cause it honestly isn't. By keeping cars it makes things easier. Which is sending the wrong message to young ones. They are less dangerous , cars are metal which would make the impact a lot harder Buying a car is very expensive espicially. It does cut down a lot on pollution which is better for the environment. A lot of people can't afford any type of car or insurance for cars Life without cars would be a world that would be much healthier. America would also be a lot healthier. Cars are what help people get from point A to point B.But they do help kill Earth slowly. I honestly think that it is a good idea forÂ  Germany going life without cars Which is gonna create less traffic which is a big plus for everyone that drives. Every argument for someone that wants cars, there is a counter argument. There is no reason people should argue about keeping cars, at least in my opinion. If I was living in Germany or Paris or Bogota I would definetly be happy with that descison. Bikes are a lot safer espicially. People are also always judging people for what type of car they have or the year it was made or how much it costs, taking out cars would definetly keep those type of people from ranking your belongings. Cause not everyone is as well off as you are. They might not make the same amount of money as you do, or have to pay more bills than you do.
