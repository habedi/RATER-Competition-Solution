Dear Principal,

Maybe if we had more interesting subjects we would be less worried our phones or less tempted to use them. Its not fair even though we came to school to learn we also have the rights to socialize. I think that's one of the most important things you can learn now. Social skills is very important in , job interviews , college interviews, and in meeting new people . But at other times its not because i always see teachers using their phones. So why can't we? I feel that the rule , "we can't use cell phones during school hours" is sometimes reasonable . We should all work together as one . The school system should work with the students and the students should work with the school system . Lets start by allowing cell phones and having funnier subjects . And return we "the students" will pay more attention in class and become more involved . As i student i feel that, we the students should be able to use our cell phones during our free time. I know that's a big part of why i use my phone during school hours, because our subjects aren't fun enough . Even though we're becoming young adults i still bealive that we should stay young as long as possible . And what better way to that then having fun in school because that's like our second home. I bealive in this because , its not harming anything or anyone , most kids have them and use them during school hours anyway , and its modern day so there should be rules that are considering our wants. I also feel that if we got to use our cell phones during free time, cell phones would be less of a distraction in class . Simply because we've already got to use them at some point of the day.
