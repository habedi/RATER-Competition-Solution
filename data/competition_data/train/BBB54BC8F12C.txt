It keeps them occupied it can benefit the teachers too it's fun for students Other than class work, I'm sure all students wish they could be doing something better in school. Such as playing soccer, or taking pictures for the schools yearbook. and 
Lastly, extracurricular activitiesÂ can give a helping hand to teachers and administrators. 

Doing an activity can take up any unused time in a students break after school. All extracurricular activities keep students occupied. Instead of sitting around on your phone after school, you could be playing outside doing sports with your peers. 
All students should do at least 1 extracurricular activity Another reason students should do extracurricular activities is because it's fun! 
To conclude this, Any type of volunteering could help out different people in your school. Working on the yearbook would be a big help to whoever's in charge of editing it and taking all the photos. And if there's time taken off of class for clubs then some teachers have extra time to get their own work done, so everyone wins. I hope reading this made you believe that all students should participate in at least 1 extracurricular activity in school or after school. It keeps them occupied, it can be fun for the students, and it gives the teachers a helping hand. You get to choose any activity that'd fit your likings and hobbies. Maybe sports aren't your thing, so you could take a photography club or become a part of the student council. You could also become a part of a club that just plays board games all day. There's something out there for everyone.
