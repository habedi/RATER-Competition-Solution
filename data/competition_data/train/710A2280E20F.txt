Many pictures that people show of their "encounter" just for attention. Others are just hoaxes. They probably would have no idea (if they existed, that is). In the passage it says that The Face resembles an Egyptian pharoh. I don't think that aliens could understand what that was and leave an imprint on Mars that resembles a pharoh. It is logically impossible for aliens to create what we call The Face. Technology/weapons that advanced don't exist yet, so it could not happen. What kind of technology would they be using? A large laser? Strong winds could have eroded the surface of Mars and carried its contents to another location miles away from where they originally were.

Some lighter winds could have made indents on the flat part, giving it "facial features." Even though no one knows how The Face was made, there are some more possible explanations. Although we do not know if such life forms exist, it still could not happen. It would take hundreds, or even thousands of lightyears to travel to the Milkyway galaxy. Extra-terrestrials would most likely have the same life-span as us, or slighty shorter/longer. So they probably couldn't survive the whole trip to our galaxy. How would aliens even know what a human face looks like? Yet the lack of evidence says that they don't exist. We have no evidence that truly proves that aliens are real. On the other hand, we were not there with those people to know that it wasn't true.
