Still I support your plan to insure an academically responsible team for all activities This not only affects sports , it also affects band , choir , and reading groups. Yet , there is one flaw . children who are passing at a C average and stay at a C average will not get a chance to be a part of their favorite activities . I agree with your plan to change the plan so that only B average students can participate in the school sports or other activities . To principal:

I have found about your plan to change school policy . That it is changed so that only students with at least a B average can participtate

This will motivate children , who want to participate in the schools teams , to work hard . This is a great plan because it insures that the students are academically responsible . It might give other students a chance to form part of the schools sports team and other activities .
