The students receiving high grades deserve privileges. Being able to play sports and other activities after school can be a privilege. This will also prove and show the other students what rewards they may receive by working hard. 
The second reason I highly suggest to enforce this policy is to reward the students that are already working hard. Students may be getting a C or D or maybe even be failing more than a few classes. But these students still want to do sports. Because the are getting low grades, they cannot participate unless they work harder to get higher grades. 
Therefore, I believe you should change the school policy and raise the expectant grade level to a B average for students that would like to participate in sports and other activities. the students that do work hard can participate as a reward for working hard. Second, I believe this will be a motivation for the C average students. 
The first reason I agree is because the students that are getting lower grades that still want to do sports can look at this new policy as a motivation. irst, I agree with your plan for this policy. Dear principal,
