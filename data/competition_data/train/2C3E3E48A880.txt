our student have excellent attitude grades That an other good reason .

In conclusion I think that that you should let us have at least a very super high C Dear Principal ,

They aren't getting in trouble much and ,they are very respectful to the teachers What if there is a school trip and most the kids have a high C or a very low B cant go Maybe even possibly over more then half the school wont be going because of their grade that's why i think that the students with C's should be aloud to participate in sport activity's and school trips. And they cant play because of their grade . Then our our school team wont be as good as the other schools .Neither will they be better because our good players wont play . What about our basketball player there good too ,but most of them have C's . Or maybe they will even transfer school . But if they don't have Bs or higher grades what sense is there of having good sports players .Then our school will be known as the loosers in every sport because our good players aren't playing .That's why you should even drop the average to C's so that our good players could have a chance of being successful . Most of our schools students are very good at playing sports The students will be less active then what they are suppose to be What if there are very good football player in our school. 
An other reason ,
