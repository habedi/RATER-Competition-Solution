doing community service helps kids stay out of trouble such as gangs, violence, and drugs. it helps kids to be more disciplined, more respectful, more caring for our planet, more careful, more safe, and more mature For example helps out the community to be more cleaner. Sometimes people think that doing community service is just a waste of time because they don't want to do it or they think that it is just boring. But community service can show you new things. Such as taking care for the elderly, taking care of the planet, respecting others, and helping others. One last thing about community service is that it makes our community look more better than others, and it helps our community to be better for the people that live in our community. Also Those are my reasons on why our school should do community service. One Example is that kids who do community service are more organize. students are require to take community service It also Dear Mr principal,

I think helps them get organized ecause it Community service is helpful to kids that get bored at home.
