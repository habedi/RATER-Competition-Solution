Plus if you go with policy 2, you will more than likely have a bunch of angry teens who are ready to rebel. Thank you for taking my points into consideration. 
Therefore if students are not turning off their phones, disrupting class, and being a class distraction, I believe that it's your duty to take away that cell phone privilege. Only returning to policy 1 when you believe that they can handle it. Although I do firmly believe that cell phones should be treated as a privilege and not a toy. You are giving them the responsibility to turn off their phones. Also by choosing policy 1 you are telling your students that you trust them. The reason I am saying this is because I am not saying that you won't have people sneaking them around still, They sneak their phones around and pretend to be listening but really they might just be texting. many other schools have tried to enforce the "no phone" policy (or policy 2) but that doesn't seem to be working. I believe that you should use policy 1. I am writing this letter to express my views on the new cell phone policy's you are taking into consideration. Dear Principal,

but just by letting them know that there is a time for cell phones might help them think twice.
