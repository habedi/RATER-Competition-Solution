I also think that students should be allowed to use phone in lunch periods and free time because its another way of being social and kids need to be social. These are the good and bad things about policy one.

This is why I have chosen policy one. Policy two could stop some rumors.

It would not stop all the rumors because rumors can be started outside of school where students would have access to their phones. 
If the school went with policy two most students would still bring their phones. Another reason I think students should be allowed to bring phones to school is if something happens to the school and the school is not able to contact the students parents the students themselves could contact their parents. What if they need a for or something important they could call their parents and ask their parents to bring it to school. Although I agree with policy one there are some risks to bringing your phone to school. 
Another reason policy two could be better is because most rumors start of as a text or something someone posts on like facebook. 
Your phone could get stolen.

You could get it confiscated.

If phones get stolen there will be accusations and there will be some students who would fight because of those accusations.

There could be more fights and stolen properties and parents would get upset and they could press charges to the school or the person who stole the phone. To the principle,

The school should go with policy 1. I think this because some students need to contact their parents right after school.
