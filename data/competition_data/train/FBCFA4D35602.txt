COMMUNITY_SERVICE

Also I'm sure you would not want to go through the schools files and see a whole bunch of bad grades, when you could tutor the ones younger than you that need help.! I mean it's not that hard. The principal, board of education, or even the police ,should all help us to keep OUR environment clean as well. THINK ABOUT IT.! (you do not want people to come in GORDO, or any other town and see a whole bunch of garbage thrown on the ground.) Also i feel that we all help put the trash down, so why not help pick a little up every now an then. Just think about it, if every student in the schools did this, we would never have to worry about tutors, baby sitters, or even trash pickers, and many other helpful things I think that the principal should make all students in the high and elementary schools do community service. That is about all I can say about the community service, because when it all comes down my final answer is Yes, he should.! I feel this need because it takes up time and it also helps our community. YES.! I feel that all kids should do community service.
