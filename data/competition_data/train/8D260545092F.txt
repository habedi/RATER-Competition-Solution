help them learn what it is like to work for a living it will teach them responsibility 
First, I strongly support students to be required to do community service because it will teach them responsibility. In a nation wide poll, 60% of parents think their child is not responsible with their time and money. With community service requirements, this rate could go down with more students completing community service. I think this would make many parents very happy, because they have more responsible children. and the students who participate will become more mature. It has come to my attention that some students have been performing community service, but others think it takes too much time away from what they need and want to do. Also, you are trying to decide whether to require students to perform community service for a grade. So, I am writing you this letter to express my position on whether students should be required to do community service or not. I strongly support students to be required to do community service 
Secondly, community service would help teens learn what it is like to work for a living. I strongly support students to be required to do community service because the students who participate in the community will become more mature, the work would help teens learn what it is like to work for a living, and it will teach them responsibility. In many cases, students don't know what it is like to work because their parents are always buying everything they need to survive and grow up. They might take advantage of their parents because of getting everything they want. So, community service would help them understand their parents perspective a little bit more.
