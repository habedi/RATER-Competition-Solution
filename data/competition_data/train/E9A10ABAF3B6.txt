Making extracurricular activities mandatory for all students would not be a good choice. causing them to be unsuccessful in their futures because they would not have education to get a degree in college, causing it to be difficult to get a good, well paying job. 

Making extracurricular activities mandatory is not a good choice. Children currently have 7 hours of school and they would not enjoy school being extended so it takes away their free time. Students would become uneducated as a result of mandatory activites. They would not continue attending school because of they would not find the activites enjoyable or entertaining, and the activities do not help students achieve academically. Students already have 7 hours of school and they would not enjoy more of it. They should have their own free time because the activities would not be enjoyable for them because they are forced to participate in the activites. 
The students would not want to attend school because of the mandatory extracurricular activities and if they do not attend school they would become uneducated, if they were forced to do activities that they did not want to participate in. None of the activities involve working on school work or school assignments. The children would have less time to work on their school work The students would become uninterested in school because they would not enjoy participating in activities that they are forced to do Children deserve their own free time.
