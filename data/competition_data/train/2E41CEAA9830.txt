ideas: ask who and who can help out, who can stay after school, or maybe write a letter to their parents and ask them? maybe make them sign an agreement? and it helps to make a better living. dear TEACHER_NAME.

helping the community is very important to the environment, but most us "the students"

cannot be able to do this type of work after school. unless is during school time? i believe you make the right choices to our campus. for example: i have to go work after school, do chores in my house, take care of my brother, and maybe just do my homework. i can help you think with some ideas? you can predict them to help us increase a better environment!?
