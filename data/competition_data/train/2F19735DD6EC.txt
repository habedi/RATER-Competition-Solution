the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. 
Then i gave him my response he said why you don't think it's aliens i told him i don't belive and aliens. He said thats not a good enough reason because i did not state facts so i told him he said the picture look like alien heads. So he got mad at me i said state your reason why you think a alien put it there. He responed that he dont know i said you have to know something but then he saw an picture and he said that a alien put it there i said impossible. 
The agrument started because we were talking talking about it an Do you want to hear a story? so i was at work cause im a scientist an me in my friend had an agrument about what happen to mars about the facemark. Last, we came together an said we dont know he argument kept going on because he said i dont know what a alien look like so you dont.
