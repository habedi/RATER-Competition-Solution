Many students are not worrying about having good grades in school. i believe that our school policy should change and make their grade requirement be at least a B.   One advantage is that the variety of colleges or high schools you can choose from is much larger. If your GPA is low in high school or middle school, some schools and colleges will not accept your application. You could be stuck going to a community college. Instead, they are worrying about their social life and their sports teams. 
I personally play on 3 different sports teams and can easily maintain a B average. Many of my friends that are on my sports team do not care as long as they have a passing grade in school. They say that they should be focusing on sports instead of their school work. Really, it should be the other way around. School should always come before social life. 
These are all reasons for why I believe that your idea is correct. The reason for this is because grades are why we are in school, is to get educated. Are parents care enough about us to put us in school and give us a chance to go to college and get a career. Some students go to college to get recognized in sports. That, to me, is perfectly fine as long as they are doing good in school. I believe that grades should be the main focus while you are in school There are many advantages to having good grades in school Dear Principal,
