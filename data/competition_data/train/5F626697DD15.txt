another great reason electoral college has , is that a big problem ,like "Big States" In the past years our country has been run by a "electoral college" voting system. Has always been the soultion to our (america's) equation. Its been in bussines since 2012 now and so far has seen no problems. Our country has a strong base an voting system for our country period . Dear Senator,

Every one has part in the election during Electoral College , no one is left out like popular voting ways. From "source 3: in defense of the electoral college :five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president" by richard A. Posner. by far this is the best efficent ,wide variety of choices an accecible to all in the U.S. It has been updated and fitted toward our government.    The way we are voting now has no problems so far , so even if the state has a huge populationÂ  than other states . they equal out the vote of thepopulations so that every one could have an equal chance. Even though" elctoral college may some times be unfair out dated , and irrational."(from "source 2: the indefensible elctoral college: why even the best -laid defenses of the system are wrong"). Like how every thing is settled majoritry rule , but in this case "everybodys president".
