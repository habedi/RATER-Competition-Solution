If we did not have community service some of the kids in our community would not get tutored and our parks would be a mess. it helps many kids keep there life's on track and helps them to stay out of trouble it is a proven fact that most kids who stay off the streets and do some activity such as basketball, community service, soccer, art etc.

stay out of trouble With out our volunteers we would not have a lot of thing like the boys and girls club the fresh produce garden right around the corner and our very own Christmas tree farm. but I believe that community work is very important the question asked is very hard for me because I have some friends who love community service and some who would never help me carry groceries from my car to my door step To whom ever this may concern The community has been good to us so I believe we should be good to it, and yes I believe making the school perform community work would be a great idea it will show the importance of our community even if it is just pick up trash at our local park. Community service also helps our community in many other ways.
