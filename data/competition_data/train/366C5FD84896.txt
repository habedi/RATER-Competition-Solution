According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the election over 60% of the voters would abolish the electoral college and put in a direct election. The system is set up to where you may recieve the most votes yet lose the election so much for a "democracy". which always avoid all the bad the electoral college does and only focus on the so called "good". Some of the ludicrous claimes made by supporters of the electral college are that you avoid run off elections, the so called "certainty of outcome", and many other outlandish claims At its core the electroal college is unfair to the people it is a rigged winner-take-all system in each state since most candidates dont even take the time in the states they know they are going to win forsure or have no chance on winning. Not only that but also the fact that the electoral college has the possibility for a tie (at that point the senate would elect the vice president) (state delegation would elect the president) this would completely abolish and not reflect the will of the voters. When one votes you are voting not for a president but for a slate of electors who then elect the president. These electors are not forced to vote for the cantidate you picked and in the past have not. The electoral college is viewed by the populace as a greedy snake who is suffocating the voters freedom and placing it in a slate of electors. It is a fact the people prefer a direct vote, the electoral college is unfair, outdated and is holding us back from expressing our full right to vote. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didnt see the cantidates at all. Yet some people still argue that the electoral college isnt flawed and fairly represents everyone.
