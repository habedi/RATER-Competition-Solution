If you have an imagaination its like the earth has its functions and feelings. Like the weather and natural things like landforms that form This landform just happened to be a poppin thing for us on Earth 
We have landforms all the time on Earth so what makes this time special?

How would they survive and humans can not. In paragraph nine it discribes how hard it was to even get a picture of this face. If its very hard to get a good glimpse of this image. Its going to be struggle to live and be active on Mars as well. This has to be a natural landform that happens to looks like a face. If someone really did this, they would want credit and all the fame for all their hard work and i think we would have spotted them all ready. It is not created by aliens because there is no proof of humanans let alone aliens found on Mars This face is not created by aliens.
