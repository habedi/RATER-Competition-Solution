ut I think that Popular vote would be better than the Electoral College because then the votes would be fair. The Electoral College is not fair for some states. lot of people say that one vote cannot do the job. I agree because they should let the people decide what president they want to have. Some people may disagree on that. Maybe other people want just states to vote, and get it over with. It would be an easier way to choose the president, i think popular vote would be a lot more fair than Electoral College. t is said that Many people say that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and or irrational The popular vote allows people to vote on what president they want to vote for, They should really try to make the Electoral College the best method that there can be. Popular vote is already a challenge, but they should also try to improve the popular vote method.    Even a person, that goes by the name of Bob Dole, said to Abolish the electoral college. Others may have different opinions, maybe they like the Electoral College better than the popular vote. he popular vote would be the best way to go. The Electoral College in the other hand, allows votes from states to be made. It is an easier method to get the states to vote for the president, and it takes less time. but it would get the job done in no time. it would be kind of difficult to count all those votes, this method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. It also requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes cast. I would choose the Popular vote over the Electoral College.
