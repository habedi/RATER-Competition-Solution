Don't expect everything to run smooth at first, things may always be changed. Try out letting students use the phones during free time, it's just something new. It may lead to a happier environment, and maybe even better grades for students. Young people love freedom and being allowed to do what they want, giving them this freedom could have a tremendous outcome. There is always a punishment for not following the rules, some will have to be thought of, of course, if the new policy that you choose is not followed. What is the student is having a bad day and can't call a parents for a little help? That could affect how the learn in school, not being able to have outside connections. It would be like the student was in a cage for an entire school day, how would you feel to be locked up in a cage? The student's should be allowed their freedom. Policy two however, I am against. The idea of no phones what so ever seems harsh and strict. There is really no downside to policy number one. It will make most students very pleased as well. I am sure that you have many other things to think about, so, with that I give you, thank you and goodbye. 
During free time, students aren't putting their time into anything anyway. Letting them use their phones will have no affect what so ever or anything important, such as school work. Not allowing the phones during class time is respectable as well, that way the learning isn't affected. The idea of allowing students to use cell phones during free time makes absolute sense Out of the two possible policies you are considering I would have to say that i favor the second Dear Principal,
