The finally reason it is good for the school in many ways here are some ways. One of the extracurricular activity is sports like basketball. One thing it can teach you to be a leader and a good team player. The other extracurricular are the yearbook and the serve on the student council. The extracurricular activity can help your education. By helping you learn how to count money and take photo and put data on the computer. At the end extracurricular activity can help your mind set grow even after school. Your mind is grow every single day this just makes it grow faster.

For ex it can give yourself confident to show who you really are. As well it will let you meet other people or possibly make a new friend. Also help you see what kind skill you might have for your future. That is the first reason why communicate is helpful in the extracurricular activity. and it is good for the school in many ways.
