Dear Mr/Mrs. Principle,

I would be happy with school if this happened, and all the other kids would be too. 
Say perhaps a student was sick and wanted a parent or other family to pick him/her up from school. Wouldn't you think that it would be fun to have phones allowed at school? Don't teachers have to communicate also? Ask yourself these questions, wouldn't it make you feel good that your students are happy with school? This would make lives at school easier for students to communicate If a phone did go off in class, it should be taken away and given back after class. Otherwise, this idea is fantastic. Normally phones must be off during class to not distract another students learning I am a kid who loves my phone. Students rely on their phones for many different reasons. An example would be texting and calling, this is important for a good social life at school. It would be a great idea to let students use phones during lunch and other free times. If a student lets say, forgot his lunch, he should be able to call his parents to bring him/her one.
