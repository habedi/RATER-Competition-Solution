you have no way of knowing what is and isn't done in terms of who's actually servicing the community. It's an awful fact but now a days the honor code doesn't mean nearly as much as it used to. 
most of these activities are not related to the school in any way 
Because of the fact that meaning you're asking all of the students in your school to take their time and devote it these certain activities. On top of homework, that's an awful lot to be doing after school. a majority of these services take place outside of the school, 
Not to mention the fact that Making it a requirement would simply be unfair. Dear Ms. Principal,

Community Service is exactly how it sounds, it's a service. A service is done by someone who is good at that particular thing. Not to put a bad name to a good face but there's definitely not 100 percent of our student body that are good at going and talking to elderly retirement home patients, or helping various animals at the SPCA.
