the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. 
In conclusion, the driverless cars will change our future. It will help people get around easily. The cars will provide greay safety features. Its will also help the environment. I hope i would be able to see these driverless car around someday. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.

The driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel. 
First of all, My argument for the development of the driverless cars is that we should have them. These cars will change the way our future will look like. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use They can also provide really good safety features. they can become really helpful to people the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there. 
Second, 
Last, hese cars should be allowed to be made, The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive. the driverless car can provide really good safety features.
