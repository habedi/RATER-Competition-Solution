If students do this community service it would be better for the community and it would be good for the town. I have one question though would students be doing this inside of school or out side of school. Last year if 7th and 8th graders got honors the whole year they got the opportunity to go to Washington D.C but they had to write an essay and do some sort of community service and pay three hundred and fifty dollars in order to go. I don't think that all kids are going to agree with me. if people go on field trips how come this cant just be like a field trip. i think people don't like community service because they are lazy or just don't feel like it. the students would not have to do it all day everyday I think that community service is a very good thing.

I also think that it would be a nice thing if students participated in community service sometimes. We could clean up in a lot of places. To TEACHER_NAME
