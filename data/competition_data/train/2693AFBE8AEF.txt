It will make our school a better environment Most kids just play around and think that school is a joke when truly its not. The kids that really like to play the sports should want to try and get the good grades to play the sports. I truly think and believe in that. It is just that easy to keep the sport if you just do your best to keep in it. I would love for you to do the best you can to make that change it will be a good way to get the students to want to do better in school. The reason why is because I like your idea a lot and think its great that you want to do that. As you may know not many of us students like the idea of you wanting to change the schools policy were we can not play any sports unless we work harder to have at least a B average. Dear principal,
