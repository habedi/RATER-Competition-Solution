the electoral college requires a presdential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president already. So for a solid region, has no incentive campaign. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised. (To feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, isn't their presdient).

The electoral college restores some of the wieght in the political balance that larges states would lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.
