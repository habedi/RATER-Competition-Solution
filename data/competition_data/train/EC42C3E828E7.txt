A C is a passing grade, Dear Principal,

This change is a bad idea. Students should be able to participate in after school activities with a C average for these reasons. The rule is currently a C so why should we change it? For sports there wont be enough people to make teams, so our teams would have to forfeit. This would give the school a bad sports program, and a bad reputation about it. 
It may not be honoroll worthy, but it will get you through high school. It is one thing for a D not to be able to participate because it is not a passing grade, but a C should because it is a passing grade. 
A C is a passing grade. if you did change it more people wouldn't be able to participate in these activities. nd the rule is fine now so why should we change it?, It is also the way our parents did it, and they turned out just fine. Most of the people who are graduating have turned out fine too. Like that saying " Don't fix it if its not broken". If you make the change then there wont be a lot of people participating because most people have a C average. As you can see there are many reasons not to make the change! Everything is good now so don't change it. Take the students advice and don't change it.
