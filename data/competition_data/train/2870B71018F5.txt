So this is it my final thoughts on the driverless cars. I say the cars aren't safe yet. 
Other reasons why i am againest the driverless cars is because If they keep making driverless cars all the regular cars are no longer going to be in use. That's going to be a lot of money people have wasted on a car that no one is using anymore. Another reason why i am againest the driverless cars is because people might not feel safe to ride in them. Honestly would you want a car to be driving for you on the highway late at night. No the driverless cars aren't safe yet .They can cause a lot of accidents and problems for you and the company that makes them. all the cars the world has made what are they going to do with them. Why because to me We should not make them but use that technology and money on something else. In my opinion So that's all i have to say about driverless cars. Instead of using the driverless cars we can use the money on many more important things that the world needs. Like in the passage it says that only a safe car has a human driver in control at all times. they should not make these cars because they are going to be a waste on money. I think if we use dirverless cars there would be so many accidents. The cars won't know what to do. Even in the article it says the cars that they have devolpoed aren't even completely driverless. It says that the cars can steer,accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. i am againest the driverless cars
