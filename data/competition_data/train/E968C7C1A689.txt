Dear Principal


Please consider this option. It will be a great time for bonding and getting to know new people. Everyone should bring old work clothes and be provided with gloves and a bag lunch. If we really want to clean this town and have it waste free we could ask other schools in town if they would like to help us. However if we accomplish this job the school needs to look into having recycling bens on our campus. We need to do this job two days every week if we want our town to look like it is supposed to look. It is a great solution for pollution and all of the students would love to help out the community I also think that it would increase the population of our town. I think that taking time to do community service is a great idea.
