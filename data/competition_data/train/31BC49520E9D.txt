It can help students learn to be more kind and caring. I think that all students should at least do some community service throughout the year Even though some people may think it is a waste of time, I think that each student should have to have around ten hours of community service a year or three hours a month. Community service should also be counted as part of a subject that they are not doing so well in. Most mature students would want to fix a bad grade and keep their community clean and an overall happy place to be in. I think that if students really care about their community and their grade, then they would want to be involved in community service. Dear Principal,

In the end, it would be better for them to keep their area clean and healthy, so that they will not get sick. Most students will probably not want to do any community service because they are lazy and do not feel like helping out their own community. it makes the world a better place little by little. 
In conclusion, These activities are work made fun. If you are doing community service and doing something you love, such as dealing with animals or babysitting little kids, in no longer becomes something that you have to do. It becomes something you want to do. You do not even have to be rewarded. Doesn't it feel great when you know you helped someone out? Community service is a very good way to build character. Community service will help teach them discipline and obedience. The schools that already require community service hours, are already trying to make the kids of today, leaders of tomorrow. If just a few hours a week is all it takes to make the society a safer place, then it should be required. but the ones who do are not just helping society, they are also helping themselves. Of course, many students will not do any community service, Tutoring elementary kids and helping out at the local animal shelter can become entertainment.
