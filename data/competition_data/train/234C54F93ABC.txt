But You have to know how to manage to keep your grades up and be able to perform in community service. I strongly believe community service should be required for elementary school students and up I think community services would actually be a wonderful success. I believe community service would have good looks on to our schools. The only thing that may be wrong about it is the whole work time. Also it would make our students look like they want to help and change the world Also the students would actually be communicating wit each other Having fun, making new friends would be amazing. Dear principal,

Community service can help the students that are in high school get into colleges. It can help the students be able to choose what college they want to go to not what college they have to go to Actually make it a better place for the children that live in the area. To the older people the younger people may take out the trash for them, mow their lawns, etc. If that would happen this world would be an better place. A place where everyone would get along and peaceful. I would like to put my opinion about students being required to perform community service.
