Should we have an elector college voting systems or switch up to popular voting system. I think we should swicth it up back to the popular votes win. the reasons why we should use this type of voting systems is because we get to choose are president, By using the voting system of majority win can force or pursuade people to start voting and make shore that all u. s people start voting 

Here are some of the disaddvantages when having an electoral voting system

nd Are votes don't even matter when voting for presiden who knows if voting for electors and that electer dose not do as we want for electing the right president having this type of voting system is so much complicated for the process you half to go through when electing a president.        because most people know that there votes wont even matter when electoral voting system is taking place with popular votes even the slitest of just one vote changes who becomes president so i would think people will start being apart of there states votes an become better citezens by voting. "Under the electoral college systems voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who inturn elect the president".
