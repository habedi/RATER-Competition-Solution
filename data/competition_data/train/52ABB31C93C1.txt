Doing a sport, working on the yearbook and being a part of student council are all things you do with a group, I am here to tell you why I agree, and why you should too! The principal has recently announcedÂ that he has decided that every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Such as doing a sport, working on the yearbook, or being on student council. because of this the student might make some new friends, and if a student has a hard time talking to people, this might make it easier. Rather then being bored all day, the student will be doing something that isn't just school work. Speaking of doing something other then school work, the student might find out that they really enjoy a certain activity, and will start wanting to go to school to do said activity. 
In conclusion, I believe that having every student participate in an activity is a great idea,
