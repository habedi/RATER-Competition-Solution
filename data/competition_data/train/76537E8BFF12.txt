If something gets tied then they just throw the vote to the house of represenitives. I think if there is a tie that it should result in a re-election. but it sure beats the college. there are too many variables for the college. too many areas where something can go wrong. Now im not saying that popular vote is perfect either this is presidency here, not what game we should play in Gym! majority vote makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. I mean come on, we are deciding the next LEADER of our country! 
Also, i have to say. the electoral college sounds like a really bad idea! 
but what of the smaller states like Montana, or Maine, or Wyoming even? they deserve as much of a voice as the others. its good for states like Texas, California, and New york. I have recently been learning about the electoral college. i have been learning alot about it, actually, But thats probably just me (personally i think it should be like the hunger games).

Again. everyones wishes should be accounted for. and Well thats really all I have to say. I hope you read this letter and maybe you can send it to your superiors or whoever it is you work for to get my letter read by the President. And see if we can fix this problem here. Dear, Senator PROPER_NAME
