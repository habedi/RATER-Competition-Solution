. That's my arguement on this topic. People just fail to see that because of the electoral college, everything is going great, the judgement is fair, and everything is balanced Another thing they fail to realize is that the way they pick things, everything is balanced. The elections and that stuff, is all balanced No crap about who they like better. They base it off what they think the person will do for the country. What good changes they would make in the future. The great things they could accomplish to help us as citizens ofÂ the United States. Now that's very good judgement. What a lot of people fail to realize is that it's a fair judgement. 

everything is balanced and it's a fair judgement, I on the other hand, am fine with it. What people fail to see is that because of the electoral college , is that everything is going great, In this moment of time people just don't seem to realize that things are fine the way they are. I mean everyone's doing their own thing and living life. Some more than others, but that's the way it has always been. There are some changes here and there but they're minor ones. People just overreact , and make it seem like a big deal when it isn't. That's just the reality of it. It's not going to change Many people don't like the way the president is picked. They are picked by the

Electoral College Everything they decide is based on the majority of who you guys picked also. It's not just based on their decision, it's also based on yours. They are actually part of you guys. So they do it to help you all not themselves. That's just how it is. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
