Finally, Joining the UNRRA

is a great oppurtunity because you can do and learn thing you never knew how to do and learn you never knew about the country you might be inat that moment. You could visit muesems and see acieneit artifacts. You could see famous art pecies painted by really famous painters. If people would give the UNRRA a chance you could probably have a very nuce timeand think about inspiring kids to join when they grow up. ou may learn how to do things you never knew how to do like fishing or you might learn about the different countries you go to and you could share that knowledge with your friends when you get home. You could even visit muesems and see things you never knew existed. The things you see could inspire you to make something compared to that and it might be in a muesem one day. you never know what you might learn over sea. I think people should join the UNRRA(the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Assosiation).

Next, Luke would want people to join because ,but, when your heading back home you can use the empty space that you put the supplies in for fun activities Some peolpe just think their going over sea to help other people and that's boring so it's a win win. L you get to travel world nd your giving supplies to countries so they can rebuild their country ecause being a Seagoing Cowboy is good First, I have to say that from Lukes point of veiw he is saying that uke would want people to join because joining forces with countries to help other countries is something that is helping the less fortunate countries
