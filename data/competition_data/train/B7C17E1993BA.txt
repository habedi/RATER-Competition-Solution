Most people may not like who are next president is gonna be but all just have to deal with it because we all cant go back and pick who we wont to be president. Does the Electoral College work?

The Electoral college is a process in which it happens. The Electoral collge is not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president. The Electors are people who vote for President and Vice President, and how many votes each one has gotten. The priotity in the Electoral College is that it consist of having 538 electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect for the new President. It has to have the same amount of entitled alloment of electors to the same amount in its Congressional.

''Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors''. But are state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are. We as Americans all get a new President every four years and its always held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you are voting for your presidenrt you're voting for your candidate's electors. But most staes just have a ''winner-take-all'' system that awards all electors to the new winning president candidate.

It all depends on how many votes a person gets. Some may get only one vote and others will get millions of vote it all depends on if they think your good enough to rule your your county. It is very hard for you to make a decsion that big.
