I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom isn't valuable. The FACS can be cool at certain part in life, but only If the person that you are using it on would like you to know their mood. In paragraph 3 it says that the Facial Action Coding System has six basic emotions. Those emotions are happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. If I found out that the computer was reading what my emotions were I'd be a little feared, suprised, and the emotion that they dont have .. weird. I say it isn't valuable because like it says in paragraph 5 that the computer tells what kind of mood you're in. That's kind of weird dont you think? I dont know maybe its just me. Paragraph 6 it states that the computer can recognize If a student is becoming confused or bored with the activity that he or she is doing, I think that's popping someones bubble honestly. I'd be weirded out a little when they told me that a computer would be telling me how I feel. I dont know about you guys but I personally like to keep to myself This is why I believe that the Facial Action Coding System is NOT a good idea to have to express how children in a classroom feels.                                         I dont like to be the center of attention or wanting anyone thinking that I need attention. I just believe that people should get the chose to tell you how they feel on their own IF they would like you to know how they feel.
