Other than that I do not see a very good reason to require us to do community work That would be a good idea because some students who would like to do community work could sign up and do it. The only reason That I think would be a good reason to require us to do community service is if we had bad behavior or bad grades. With the time spent doing community work we could be learning things or doing something towards our future career. Students should not be forced to do labor work, they should have some freedom to do what they wish on their free time. What you could do is have voluntary groups and activities that involve doing community work Also we have other things we could be doing in our spare time that are more useful and a better use of our time because that does not have anything to do with school or education You should not require SCHOOL_NAME students to perform community service Dear TEACHER_NAME,

If you had us doing community work there would be more complaints, more I.S.S, and more work/ responsibilities
