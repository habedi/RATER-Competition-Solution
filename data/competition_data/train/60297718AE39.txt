one day you may be driving and your car is driverless but it is an on coming car coming toward you and you don't have control of the car and the car might not sense when another car is coming toward it and it may and can cause a wreck. because but I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars it may be safe to other but it is not safe to me because I wouldn't want to have a wreck driving in a driverless car. I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars Others may agree to have driverless cars
