Surely our band will agree with this, as they have a concert in a few days. I understand your concern for our grades, as standardized testing is coming up, but surely you think that stepping up our game academically will just put more pressure on our players? Dear TEACHER_NAME,

We also have to take into account the mood of the student body. While this is mainly used for tactics in the game, a little adrenaline keeps the mind focused after the game. Considering most kids do their homework and study after everything else is finished, we could improve our homework and test grades using this adrenaline residue. Playing basketball gets adrenaline pumping through the system, clearing the mind and working faster. I'm not saying we don't need this new grading system. Can we put this into effect after play-offs? If the kid doesn't want to do their homework, then they won't do their homework. If there is general carelessness, apathy, and depression among students, then it might be time to get some results out of other extracurricular programs. Maybe we should host a bake sale, everyone loves cookies. Play-offs are popping up, and our team is being worked hard to ensure that they make it to the championship bracket. A big band concert is also coming, and we need everyone on the team and in the band. Many people on our team are putting off their assignments to do unrelated things (like watching TV).
