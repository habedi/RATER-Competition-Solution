However, Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes don't have the best projects just because they can't have other student's opinion. For example, so many different ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a person's ideas. Those who believed not being able to attend classes fom home wouldn't benefit students because they can't work with other students students can be more safe. 
nd they will feel comfortable students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable Although some say students wouldn't benefit attending classes from home because students will not have the opportunity to work in groups with other students, actually students would benefit attending classes from home Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online clases because that makes them feel comfortable just to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated. 
As you can see students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can't stay connect with other students, actually being able to attend classes from home would make students feel comfortable and secure.  Lately, more than hundred school shootings had happened, so it show us being at school can be dangerous. Other big danger can be gangs at school they can be an influence with so many bad things on a child's life.

In my opinion being able to attend classes at home can make parents happy; they don't have to be worried for their child's safety. Also, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can be more safe.
