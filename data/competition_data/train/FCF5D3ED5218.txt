Dear Principal,

I suggest that all students in the school be required to have to do community service. if the students at our school would help those who didn't have as much as they did then they would be more grateful for what they have and maybe think that school is a good thing because of how they could end up without it. Our school would be better if the community liked us more and we can get the community to like us if we help them. To get the students to help with the community then you should make community service more fun. I suggest four ways to get the students to want to help.

I think that our school is not helping enough with the less furniture. First of all, you require that everybody will be graded on how they help their community. Second, you have your students see how bad the community is in some places so that they want to help. Third, you reword them with maybe a dress down day. Fourth you have them do there service to the city during school so that the students don't take up their time to do things that they think are more important.
