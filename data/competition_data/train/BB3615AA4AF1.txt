You cant talk to them if you don't have a phone. So there for we should be able to bring phones to school.

What if there is something you have to talk to your parents about? even at lunch if there is a policy kids will still use them because there are not enough teachers compared to the amount of kids in the cafe at once.

We should be able to have phones in school for lunch and other free periods because Even if someone did have a cell phone out Most of the people that have phones are in at least sixth grade so they should responsible enough to keep the phone away during class. we should be able to use them so we can talk to our friends or our parents about something more important or something you don't want to say out loud. who would take the risk to text them back or call them back? we are responsible enough to be able to use them only in the time given.
