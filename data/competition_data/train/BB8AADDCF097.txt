. If I don't have time for myself I cant hangout with my friends and I'm sure as a teenager you were having fun with your friends. This would keep us from playing the we want to play sports that I want to do like football , baseball and other sports that keep us healthy and self motivated. For us to not be able to do what we want outside of school would be insane . Community service would not allow us to finish important school work needed to pass middle school and high school If we were out working doing community service while we should be doing homework and projects we would never pass the needed courses to get into college. As the principal of SCHOOL_NAME you should know that we need to work hard but not service hours but on education. As a teenage male I have many things that I want to do for nor will it allow us to do important things needed done. TEACHER_NAME,

You should not make us do community service it gives us less time to do things for our selves ,
