For example, it is up to students if they want to complete the project in 1 or 2 months. They can take their own time and go on their own phase. Unlike if its teacher assigned, then this means there is most likely a due date assigned by the teacher. if students design their own projects, then this means that they have more time to complete the project. 
Secondly, For example, if a student is going on vacation for 80 days and summer break is 78 days then this means he wont have that enough time to complete his assigned project. If its an assigned project then this takes time, you have to do researches. But if the project is self designed then the student can possibly finish the project in within 2-4 hours since it is self designed.
