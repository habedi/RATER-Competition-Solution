Dear Principal ,

If only some kids in our school with a B average will only get to play sports , what will happen to the other half that have a C average or below? I think every kid in our school should get to play at least one sport in school ! it is fun and you can learn from sports a lot like football, soft ball , or even kick ball Also , Therefore, if students do not get exercises they will not be able to loose weight and will not be able to learn . On the other hand , Many students will not get any exercise or time to hang out with there friends . I think that every student should be able to play sports with any grade average . In my opinion i think that students will rater not achieve more . I think it will not be fair to everyone that only the smarter kid will be able to get to play sports. We should all be able to play sports ! I think that mostly everyone will not be able to get a B average. Many people get at least a C average you can learn how to kick the ball high or how to throw a ball like pro athletes.
