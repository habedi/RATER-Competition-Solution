If it was me to chosse if I want to take online or just normal school. I'll pick school because it's much easier for me to learn because teachers would make sure your learn by making take test or quizes. You won't be because your taking online classes and you have so much time to get ready. When you have school you have less time to get ready even to have breakfast. Even if your on another state you can still do the online classes. Plus, the online classes only taking like an hour to finish. 
When your on a vaction won't have be worry about miss school work because your taking online classes. I mean I see why people would choose that for an example say if your late to class Although, people would like to be taking there classes online because people would rather sit at home on there computer than actually go to school and sit in class and listen to there teacher. If your feeling sick for the people that take online classes it's much easier for them because that can sit in bed and do there homework. Even if they have a doctor appointment for being sick they can just sit in the wait room in that time being they can just do there work while they wait. If they don't Internet they can just use hotspot.
