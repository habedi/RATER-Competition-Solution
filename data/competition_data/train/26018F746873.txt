First off our community is good but it could be better. and it would give us a chance to see how easy we have it. 
So by going to a soup kitchen or donating your old stuff to a group home. What ever it may be just show these people out there who are less fortune then us that we care and we want to make a change in there lives. My next reason is there are people out there who don't have the things we have they don't have the greatest education, they don't have a nice warm bed to sleep in, or maybe they don't have a home at all. 

help people in need Because it would give us a chance to give back to our community, I think it is a good idea that students have required community service hours. Dear TEACHER_NAME,

We have so many activities and sports events which are not cheap. But we students do enjoy them very much. I propose that we have community service hours so that we can raise money to help pay for these sporting events and buy things like equipment or uniforms, or help us go to far away tournaments. After all it is a privilege to play these sports not a nesety. By having these hours it would help our community be able to afford these things that makes our community so great.
