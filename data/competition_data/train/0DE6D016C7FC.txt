because I think having a c average would be better to have Even thought a b average is a way to bring up kids grades it still may leave kids out of school activities and other things of that sort High grades are hard to earn and for most people , it gives many kids a chance in trying new things other than only kids with a b average. Lets face it not everyone is perfect at there grades even if they really try. I know from my experiences that it ain't easy to always get straight a s or b s. it could affect many students, that strive to try hard but come out a little short of there goals. I really think you should take your time on this because nd I also think it may make some kids feel like there not good enough to take more challenging classes that may lead in more kids taking lower classes. 
I strongly feel that kids should be encouraged to try new things and by changing the standard it could take all that away
