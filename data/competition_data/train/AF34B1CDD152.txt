That's why I think that policy #1 is the best choice. Some students may run the risk of something happening to they're phones like them losing them, or breaking them, or getting them stolen. I think students should have the decision if they want to carry they're phones or not. Policy #2 in my opinion isn't a good idea just because students may need them for emergency situations. All cell phones should be put on vibrate so they don't distract other students. And students should not use them inappropriately. Students should use them for what they were made for I also think students should carry they're cell phones on them at all times just incase of an emergency. But I think students should also be able to have they're phones out during they're free time. Students can decide if they want to do they're work or use they're cell phones. Students get too distracted by they're phones during class so they miss out on learning. Dear Mrs. Principal

I think that your policy #1 is a great idea. Students should be able to have they're phone during they're lunch periods, but not during class.
