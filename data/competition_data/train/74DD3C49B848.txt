In my opinion, it should be by the electorial college. the person who gets the most ammount of votes gets to be the president. Thats as simple as it can get. And in my opinion, it is as fair as it gets. why you wouldnt want to take the process of the electorial college to pick a president? All of the pieces seem to fall into place. So isnt it the obvious choice? Dear Mr. Senator,

See, 'm not saying the elctorial college is the right way but I would really like if you can look into it.

My question to you Mr. senator is look into the elctoral college. It is obviously the right choice. 
So Mr. Senator, all i want you to do is It is also not a democratic method of selecting the next person in office. Around my community, there has been a lot of talk about how the president should be elected into office. Whether it is from the electorial college or by popular vote. This is a very important matter to me because it can change how our country is.
