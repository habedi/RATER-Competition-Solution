Would you like to save a pour animals life? It states that "Bales of hay and bages of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship." It also states that they have to clean the stalls. that would mean that the pour animals need your help because they need more people to help them out with the pour animals with feeding them and also cleanding there stalls. you care about animals on the way back from safty. forty-four nations joined together to form an UNRRA (the united Nations Relief and Rehabitstion Administation.) That needed to be recoverdfrom desasters. I think you should at least try this beacuse in the passage "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."

This is about how and also why wou schould at least think about going the Seagoing Cowboy program. If you belive that you would want to at least find out more you should partisipate it dose not even have to be that long of your searvice. 
I also think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program because it states that in paragraph six that
