I do not think it is right for students to not play any sports, if they do not have at least a B as their grades. Then there would be less players in a team of soccer, basketball, or volleyball. Dear Principal,

Many of us have a C average in this school. It should be about getting a passing grade, because a C is a passing grade. Students that want to play sports should. They should get at least a C. Some of them may have a weakness in a subject. Some may want to maybe get fit in a sport and make sure their health is good. They cant get that, because they have to get a B as their grades. For some people it may be hard to get a B as their grades. Making the students get a B average to be on a sport could get us students a little upset, because we may not agree on the fact that you do not ask for our opinion. Less than half the school will raise their grades up just to be in a sport they may be passionate about.
