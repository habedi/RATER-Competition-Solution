volunteering would be a lot more easier then making student do community service. Community service is really important for our environment and should done but making/forcing students to help is not the answer because some students might actually have something better to do. forcing could make many students upset and not put all there effort into helping out. 
most of my friends would love to do some community service but don't have the time. many of them have to do chores at home or babysit like me for example. i have a big family and my parents always needs my help to take care of little brothers and sister. i believe it should be a choice if a student would like to do some community service community service is very important but most students would rather do something else then pick up litter. if not very many students are volunteering. then maybe you should have some students encourage more to help out and give them good reasons why to do some community service instead of forcing them to and the students that have the time would volunteer to help out our community. because some students might have to do others things that are more important to him or her with a lot more encouragement more students should help out and of that doesn't work then have like some contest on who ever does the most volunteer work could win a prize of some kind. so overall its very important to help out our community but students should have the to volunteer instead of instructed to   dear principal,
