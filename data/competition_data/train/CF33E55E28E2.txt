Just think about what i said and try to make sense of it.

Another good reason on why i feel very negative towards electoral college Over all "electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" Electoral collage is very useless is that "Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people" states source 2. So you are basically voting for someong to vote for who you want to vote for and they  might not even defy your will. The electoral collage is just not fair to voters. "Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in sates they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in  the swing states. How do you feel about the electoral college? Where not even voting for the president "but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." It's really useless if you ask me. why do i say this you may ask. Well like source 2 says and gives you a great example "if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledge to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes." A good question you might be asking yourself is, that who are the electors? Well  they can be anyone not holding public office states source 2. Another problem is that the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. All you can do is just prey for the best.
