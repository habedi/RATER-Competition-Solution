I disagree with my principal's decision and I am going to explain why you should too. The principal at my school has decided that all students must participate in one or more extracurricular activity the activities include sports, student council, and yearbook. Students should not be forced to have to engage in extracurricular activities because some kids might have trouble with time management. Having to do sports or student council and yearbook along with school could put a load of stress on that child which is never good for a kids mental health. that choice should be made by the child or the childs parents only. Some kids can have a illness or disability that is keeping them from doing other things besides school that the principal may not know about. Forcing students to do some type of activity besides school should not be allowed because what if that child does not have a ride home and the school does not provide transportation. I hope that my principal rethinks their decision about forcing kids to participate in extracurricular activities. I also hope that I was able to influence you to also believe that kids should not have to participate in extracurricular activities. Having to do something else other that school could be very difficult for them. Also parents might not want their child to have to participate in other activities other than school because their child could get distracted. 
Another reason of why I disagree with the principals decision is I understand that the principal just wants his or her students to have a healthy life it should not be his or her choice if the child should have to engage in a extracurricular activity In conclusion but the choice of if students should be forced to have to participate in an extracurricular activity should not be made by them.
