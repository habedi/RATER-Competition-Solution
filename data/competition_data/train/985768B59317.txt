Since students wouldn't be able to participate after school they might be out doing bad things they should not be doing. Many students have a C average, and if one must have a B average then there won't be many students involved more at school anymore because of their grades. All we must do is just tell them to try and bring up their grades, motivate them so they can become great people in the future. 
but please have in mind that your students will know that you gave them a chance to try and be involved more in school, have fun, and get to be a part of their school's sports team or volunteering club or whatever it is they'd like to be in. I know you may think having the requirements of have a C will maybe let them think they must not try harder in their work or studies Also, a C is a passing grade so you wouldn't have to worry about them failing. In addition, maybe having them in after school activities or any sports could help them bring up their grade by motivating them to get a higher grade and to not slack in any of their studies because they must maintain a C average or above.

Dear Principal,

I would like to ask of you to please lower your requirements from having a grade B average to a C average. This way more students will be able to participate in after school activities or any sports. If you were to lower the requirements to a grade C average, then we would have more students involved with their school. For example, if there is a grade C average student, and he or she isn't able to participate in an after school activity he or she might be out doing something far more worst. Is that something you would want your students to be doing?
