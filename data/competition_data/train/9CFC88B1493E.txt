They can be dangerous by having the car drive by itself for a long period of time then need the human to take over and they could have fallen asleep. If the human would not take over then the car could crash and hurt the people inside of it. That is one reason cars should not be able to drive itself.

Another reason is they could be very expensive. People could not afford them I think here are many reasons to not have driveless cars. 
In my opinion we should not have driveless cars. I think this because they can be very dangerous. The can be a very dangerous thing. I know it can help with some things, but for the most part we should not have them. some people enjoy driving I think driveless cars is a bad idea. Also I like to drive and if driveless cars take over then people like me won't be able to drive their cars. Also the driveless car could not notice that there is a wreck or construction work ahead and wreck into it. This would just make matters worse. That is my other reason to not have driveless cars.

I mean there are a few things that could be good about a driveless car, but for the most part there is more negative things than positive things on them
