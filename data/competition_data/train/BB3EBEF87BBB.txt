There is another reasonable explanation. Scientist have found that in the western United States there are rock formations that are very similar. They are simailasr to the snake river palin in Idaho. 
The first picture was taken in 1976 so the resolution of the picture wasnt very good. Which caused it to look like there was a nose, eyes and a mouth. But pictures that were taken years after show that it could have been the quality. The first reason to why people think it is alien. Is the quality of the pictures that were taken. The first photo was taken in 1976 by the Viking 1 Spacecraft. The craft was circleing Mars trying to find a spot for its sister ship to land. The Viking 2 Spacecraft. But I am here to explain why it wasn't created by aliens. 
It is simialr to some of the rock formations that we have on Earth. Hi, my name is Decaon. And I work for NASA. I am here to discuss the face on mars. Many people think that it was created by aliens 
But the most compelling reason is. But many still believe that it is alien. Even though this some of the best evidence to peove the face on mars isnt alien but a mistake. After a lengthy expalnation. I hoope i have provided enough facts to prove to you that. During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow. The face on Mars was not created by aliens. but created by an optical illusion. That are found on Earth as well as On Mars.
