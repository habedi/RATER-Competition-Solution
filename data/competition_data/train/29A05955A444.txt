The reason why i think it would be a good idea is because I think more people would rather just have it as a C instead because they would be able to get the C instead of the B because There wouldn't be very much people on the team as if it was a C or higher. if people wanted to do sports and they had a C or lower, they would work on getting their grade up and they would learn more things if they payed more attention and they got their work in. I think it would help the students too students wouldn't want to join a sport anymore if it was a B or higher and the students would start getting lazy and their wouldn't be as much athletic people as before. Another reason why i think it is a bad idea is because if they just kept failing every class they wouldn't have as good education as if they did pay attention and they would have a better life because it would help them in life I think that would be a good idea but at the same time it would be a bad one people would get used to getting as B or higher and they would probably keep it that way. Dear principal

Another thing why i think it's a good idea is because because it would be harder for them to get the B and keep it that way. Why i think it would be a bad idea is because what if people really liked the sport but they couldn't play in it because their grade was around a C and it was hard to get it up and then people couldn't join the team so they didn't get to play
