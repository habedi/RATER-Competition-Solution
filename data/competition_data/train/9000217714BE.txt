and Teachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention. A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like. For others this policy my be a good idea because that way students that love sport's can start doing much better in school and have better grades But also many students have a grade of a (C)

or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students To. Principal,

might fill bad because they love sport's but can't play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home. My opinion about this change is a good idea nd the policy they should really change is having to no wear uniform to school because its such a distraction to me an much others. 
Instead So if i pick my own decision it would be no changing policy and its good as it is This change would not effect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good, we should vote to see if we like this policy or not so we wont have to pass thru all this stuff of the policy changing A fact about students here in SCHOOL_NAME would choose not to accept this new school policy because the old policy is u can't have more than three (F) and i would say the old policy is better than the new one our principal want to change it to
