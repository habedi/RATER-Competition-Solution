even home like say if they need anything brought to the office or brought to class for them. 
Some students need their cell phones, because some students have certain health problems This would also in turn free up phone lines in the schools main office so that the office workers job would be much quicker because no lines would be used up by any students needing to call home or wherever they must call, they could just use their cell phones. 
So take this matter into consideration, and maybe even call a school wide vote on it, and you don't even have to let students use them during free time such as between classes, or at lunch, or break.

You can have a scheduled 15 minutes or so during the day and call it a cell phone break. So please, please allow students at least that much time to use their cell phones.

Please go with policy 2.

Besides, maybe if you allow students at least a little time to use their cell phones maybe, just maybe, they won't break the rules by using them in class anyway, so all I'm asking is just please take this letter into consideration. r Students should be able to use their cell phones in school during any free time they have as long as they are not using them in class; during which time the phones should be turned off. that sometimes could prevent them from making it to the nearest phone nearest way to contact someone for help.

If this were to happen and the student had his/her cell phone on them than they would be able to text or call 911 Dear principle,
