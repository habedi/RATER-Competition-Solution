they are a little part of our life it builds our social life and connects us with friends. that's why a teacher is there for stopping them from using it. Even though we students use them during class in case of an emergency one of the students can call 911 because, I think we should be able to bring cell phones to school if were walking home and its after school and we get hurt Also what I believe that we should only get in trouble when using our cell-phones is when we are using it during class. But besides that we shouldn't be getting in trouble just by using it during lunch. But i agree we should be able to bring our cell-phones and be able to use it during our free time because were not bothering no one or harming them. ecause I feel like we should be able to bring them Also maybe one of the students need to tell there parents they need to stay after school and they cant because they took cell-phones out of school how are we going to get help without our cell-phones
