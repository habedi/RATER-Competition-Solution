The reason is that, because i understand that you feel that if a student has an F then they shouldn't be able to play. Ok , but if they have a 75 or higher they should play . They have a mid class grade. Now 74 and under you know should not be allowed to play because you need to focus more on your schoolwork than any other sports. I understand your concern about students grades and education, but being unfair to students that have a grade C average is unexcitable Kids That Have A' s And B' s have the right to play ,but I think you should let kids with a high C such as 75 and up play as well and if it goes down then no you may not play I believe that if you have a 75 and higher you should be able to play any peculiar sport you want. Dear Principle,

To be honest that's not very fare to the kids that have c' s. Principle, Your grades and education are very important in your life besides your friends an d family. You should be focused on them more than anything else besides your family cause family is important to. Maybe if you brought your grade up sure will let you try out but i think kids should try out if they have a high C cause they deserve to play, but if it goes down than no. Your going to get kicked off the team.
