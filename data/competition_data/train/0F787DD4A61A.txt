Some of the classes we have aren't even all that hard The extra curricular activities are privileges that we have and if we want to keep them we should have to work for them. If I was taken out of band because I was failing I would do everything I could to get my grades up and I know a lot of other students would too. Most students don't have any real motivation to get good grades so it'll give them one. A lot of kids are failing or getting C averages so the new policy will give the students something to work for. so it would be easy to keep grades up so long as we don't procrastinate and get lazy. but I know it will really help us and prepare us for the future. 
Having students earn their extra curricular activities would help them stay on task and if they need it they can always ask their teachers for help. Most students need the extra push to get things done so this new policy will also help them for the future by getting them to try and get better grades. I believe the new policy will be great idea. I know a lot of kids will think it's a bad thing To the principle,
