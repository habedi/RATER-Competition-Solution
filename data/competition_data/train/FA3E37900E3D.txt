causing it to be kinda scary at first but don't worry, you'll thank me later*) And last #3: My mother once told said "

It's good to try new things , but do what's best for you" 
. In my opinion

The way that the new idea occurs may effect how you do things normally, #2: , #1: Try new things but don't go too far with it. ere are some pointers just to let you know the effect of discovering new ideas and how they will come.

In my opinion

50% of people who participates in sporty events is more likely to get out there more and try newer things, competing in sports is more of a fun and energetic way to entertain yourself in what you do. herefore I say, engaging in other opportunities that present themselves is quite an offer to take. Details that support my central idea in this persuasive situation is everyone should try something different once in a while. I believe that students need more to do then just the simple things. 
In my position the fact is that I do agree with the decision of students participating in a extracurricular activity like, sports or working on a specific project or idea. Even working with council members. 
My conclusion in all this is I agree and believe that students should participate in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council because, in my opinion students may try new things based on what they like and how they feel towards it. Be safe and put forth your best effort in what you do and what happens.
