half of the things you do in the curricular s can be done at home you could teach your self to do those things these are my reasons why i dont think the school principal should be enforcing students to do extra curricular they are just unnecessary , So please next time your principals is trying to enforcing everyone to do extra curricular s tell him these reasons im sure it will change his mind.

i dont see that the curricular s are necessary they are just money and time wasting curricular ecause Almost all the extra curricular activities can do can be done during high school you can make the extra curricular activity into an a elective class and can actually make your self even more better at that curricular why does the principal think we need extra curricular s there are some curricular that you have to pay just to participate some parents force their kid to play a sport and half of the time the kid doesnt even like the sport they only do it cause of there parents , the sports can interfere with students learning for an example the student could have so much homework but he has a game that day and there parents are gonna force them to go to practice and or there games and for an other example one of the students can get badly injured and be forced to miss out on school these are just a few of the problems that could happen and it would be better not to take the risk and for the last example the student could love the sport so much he would forget about school or not even care about school , he/she would find school not necessary. One the extra curricular activities could be a special sport but that could be a problem school is a very stressful topic for most students because for some of them they either have a failing grade in there classes or to much home work to do that stack up each and everyday and by adding another extra curricular would make it even worse for those stressful students. 
a lot of students have to much on there plate and are very busy, kids nowadays have to much to worry about I do not agree with the principles statement, he should not force other students to do extracurricular activities nd time waster could get injured forced to miss out on school money waster makes you forget about school
