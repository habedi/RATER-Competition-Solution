Instead, however, i propose this; 
This is my outlook on the current matter of community service, i hope you will look into it and consider my thoughts. I think that if we find a successful way to do this we can truly change the world one school at a time and get people involved of the matters of today. I feel that if people do have the time they should, in fact, try to do something useful for the environment community or so forth. Many people have extra time to do helpful activities such as community service. For example, some have jobs or school that run late and are not able to do activities during the day. With the economy today in its depression many people work as many as three jobs just to support a family although they would like to help out to do their part. Some people have better jobs therefore earn more money and have time to do extracurricular things such as community service. I personally think that you should encourage community service but, not force it upon oneself. Dear Principal,

When you make something law people are not going to want to do it, but if you stress the fact that it is such an important matter most people will want to help out. come up with a group activity that is fun and can help out the community while encouraging people to do good. You could get a class to take a field trip to the beach and help clean up the shores, but at the same time turn it into a picnic and a fun day at the beach.
