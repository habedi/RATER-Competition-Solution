Then three years later

NASA relased another picture of the "face" but captioned "huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth". I think it is a mesa on the red planet. In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of formations on mars. The picture looked like a face so the people of the world thought oh my god. Aliens invaded mars and they will invade us run But i think it is just a mesa formed by astroids. If this keeps happening every time NASA relases a picture i think were in trouble. Well you herd my thoughts what are your thoughts.   Now no one thought anything of the "face" everyone but the consipary theorists said it was a cover story but science won the day. No matter NASA tried to say it was rock formations but no one lisitened. No one lisitened to NASA because the conspirasicy theorisits of the world were feeding the fire way too much. But two decades later (give or take two years) another picture was taken and to more and more people thought it was a face. But NASA kept saying other wise. Imagine if you saw a face on another planet what would you think? NASA saw one and thought it was a mesa others thought otherwise. Unmasking The Face Of Mars
