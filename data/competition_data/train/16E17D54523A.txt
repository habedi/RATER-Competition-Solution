This is the reasons I think that in order to play spots you have to have a B average is the wrong rule to apply to our school. when they get home they just do more overwhelming homework so if they have sports to go to that would get there mind of school and get it refocused then they will be more prepared. 

Secondly school may be overwhelming for some students and and if kids are over weight they will probably be made fun of. The reason I think sports is should be a priority is because they keep you healthy secondly I believe that sports is a way to get students mind off of school. 
because first sports can keep kids healthy and not over weight I disagree with this rule I have heard that your new rule was that students have to have a B average to play sports dear principle
