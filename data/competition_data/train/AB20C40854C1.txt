if they want to get back out there and have fun playing that sport they like and having fun with there friends teaching them how to play there learning how to get better at that sport. cause I believe that you are being to harsh on all of your students DEAR PRICIPAL

many kids love to play sports like playing for the school basketball team And when their parents find out their messing up in school they are going to do the same cause they want the best out of their child and some parents take grades real serious and will punish their child until they at least have an A or a B . 
And that's not fear to them cause they have to stop playing their favorite sport until they get their grade up some of your students are making C and D ecause if you are saying that the students have to at least have a B

isn't that kind of mean and sad And that can make that child or teen really mad and sad cause they would have to work much harder and study even more
