He understands the true meaning of love. He even knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime to help people in Africa,Asia,Haiti, and other places like that he had to understand that time is too valuable and other people give that time away to you to make you a better person and he is using it that way. Not saying this is all good there is downs too. Every rose has its thorns. 
He spent 2 weeks on each trip and then did it 16 more times! Reasons not ot would be. You could die in fog. I'm not sayin I wouldn't go but I wouldn'tlike to have the thought of dying in my brain. I bet more than once or twice he thought of dying and cried. It is a lot of time that people spend with others. It was better for Luke I think because he was a good person I know that he had to miss out because that was so much time taken up ,not wasted but taken up. I think a lot about others believe it or not. I love other people and apparently Luke did also. He had a heart of steel to make himself not say no to miss out on people in his family to go help other families. I think that was the best thing to do for anybody. He missed his mom,dad,aunt,brother/sister,nephew/neices,and his other friend to go help other people. Which makes me wonder if he's a Mason. You should join to help and say I helped that country. I think you should because there are things you have and other people don't. I also think that it should almost be a requirement to help people to go to heaven. I think alot of things should because I am like that.
