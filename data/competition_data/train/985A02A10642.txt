So from my point of view as a student

Don't want to do anything with there lives or do something for their community. So it really would be a waste of time trying to make students go and do community service because all they is going to do is just sit there and complain or just don't come My first reason is that some kids do want to help their community and make it a better place, but some kids have a lot to of stuff to do and can't really fit that in And these are my reasons to back it up. I truly believe that not all students should be apart of community service dear principal,

My second reason is that most kids are just plain lazy I think that you should have kids decide on going to do community service. and decide what time is good for them to go and do it!
