Although there are many things wrong with the electoral college like making peoples votes not exactly count In conclusion, staying with the electoral college process, it would maintain our problems of eun-off elections, certainty of the outcome and the big and swing issues.                                    The run-off election occurs when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes casted. These run-off elections cause a lot of pressure, and surely does complicate the presidential election. The electoral college does us a big favor by avoiding run-off situations, that could lead tomore complicated situations it is something to figure out. Dear state senator, because of the certainty of outcome Keeping the electoral college would be many more great successful years in voting The winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds the popular vote. In other words in 2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the votes while Romney recieved only 51.3, and because almost all of the states award winner-takes-all even a slight chance of popularity could change the results. It is very unlikely for this to happen Disputes over the outcomes of an electoral vote is possible 

and it avoids run-off elections it would take care of the swing and big states For the swing and big states, the voting is slightly different. The voters in the toss-up states tend to pay more attention to the campaign than any other place. They really get into the whole campaign and really listen to all of what the competing candidates say and do. For the big states, the electoral college does them a favor and gives them more electoral candidates 

It restores the weight in the balance that large states lose by virtue to the people voting is the most important part of politics. You out of all people speak politics, so you should understand
