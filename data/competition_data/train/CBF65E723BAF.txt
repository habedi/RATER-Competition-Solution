I hope that this paragraph informed you enogh about my program and I, and that one day you might consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys. It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins, To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Reahabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Hi! I'm look Luke Bomberger and I am a part of the Seagoing Cowboys. 
Well, The reason why I suggest this program for you is because If you enjoy traveling or adventures then I recommend Seagoing Cowboys Here is a little history on the Seagoing Cowboys.
