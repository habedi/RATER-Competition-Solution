i also wouldnt have to beg my parents to take me anywhere because i would be my own transportation.    I think NO cars is a good things saves me more money for shopping and the finer things in life. the most important part of this is that we have to be safe. and do things the right way HavingÂ a life without a car can sometimes be a bit scary exspecially if you need to do ,or be somewhere in the middle of the night . you may be ill and need a doctor immedialty you wouldnt be able to walk . They could have bigger and better things because they wouldnt have to pay a car note, or pay for gas every week it saves people lots of money It is a good advantage because limiting car usage could be a good thing for some people. only if they like to walk and do fun things with their lives. But lets look on the positive side we do have ambulances and things of that sort so we really dont have that much to worry about.
