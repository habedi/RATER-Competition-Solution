If a student was walking to or from school and got hurt, what would they do? They wouldn't have their phone with them because its against the rules to have it with them.

Having a cell phone with them would be vital, possibly determining life from death. If something like that happened and the fact that the student couldn't contact someone for help would make the situation worse, how would you feel?

The risk of that happening is too great to be dismissed. 
Another reason not being allowed to bring cell phones shouldn't be a rule is because who would they contact in emergencies. 
They paid A LOT of money for some of these kid's phones so that they can use them.

School is where most kids are for almost half of their day.

If their not allowed to have cell phones at school, they seem almost pointless. 
In addition, I don't think parents would be to happy with the rule to ban cell phones. What if the students had to stay after school one day?

Their parents would need to be informed of this otherwise they'd be worried sick when their son on daughter didn't come home one the bus that day.

With a phone available during lunch or free period, they could call their parents to give them a heads up. Using them during free periods and lunch would be a better idea. There are many ways that phones are important. 
but I don't think completely banning them from the school is such a good idea. Phones are very much over used in school I agree with your first option for a new school wide policy. Dear Principal,

First of all, students use them to communicate with their family. 
Don't make problems for your students by not allowing phones at all.
