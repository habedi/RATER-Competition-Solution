As towns such as Vauban and Paris participate in car free days, they greatly reduce the amount of pollution that would have become that day money costs. citizens should reduce the use of cars to help with financial issues, death rates, and pollution. from the cost of the car itself to the dollars to per gallon used every week, nobody likes to spend that much money on their vehicle. well we wouldnt have to as often if we did have dayswhere cars were fined if used. money costs are a large complaint in our society today, especially money involving cars Fatalaties caused in accidents, hit and runs, and wrecks happen multiple times daily. a few days or even just one of no/reduced car usage could save the lives of many. Death rates caused by cars is another reason to have a few days off from them their hard work and enthusiasm even encouraged other cities and parts of the country to join. our pollution rate is much to high for the only planet and space we can live on. increasing it daily will only hurt us and be fatal in the long run.
