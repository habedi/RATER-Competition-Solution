Dear, Mr. Principal

they may not have a source of transportation. ecause some students may not be able to come and join the other students 
The final reason I believe that community service should not be required is, and could create a problem between there self and other students. even though they join in the task of community service they might get frustrated because they are forced to do so 
In conclusion such as church or maybe a family situation. 
some students may have other activities they may have to do instead of the community service 
Another reason I believe that community service should not be required is, making it unfair for the students that do enjoy doing community service. some students even though they are required will not do the community service 
The reason I believe that community service should not be required is, I believe that community service is good but should not be required to all students. In my opinion As you know some of the students of this school like too do community service also you know some don't enjoy doing community service. Also, another reason that I believe that community service should not be required is, I believe that community service should not be required because some students wouldn't come, another reason is some may have other activities they have to do, also how some students may make a good thing into something bad, and lastly some students may not be able to come join the activity with the other students because they have no source of transportation.
