In my opinion you should not change the policy. You don't know if the students has a certain disadvantage and is not able to get higher grade. The last reason not to change is you may prevent them getting scholarships or high school credits. Preventing them to a better future like colleges and a good job. Another reason why you should not change the policy would be that students may use these activities to relax and focus on other things that are not school, schoolwork, parents , friends and other things. By not letting them play that may affect more greatly on there classes. Which can be a problem for them to move on to the next grade. 
Dear Mr. Principal,

First i want to say I am feel privileged to be able to see if i can change you mind. Hoping you can pick the right decision.
