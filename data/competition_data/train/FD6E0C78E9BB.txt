If students put that much effort in other things besides their education then they should be able to work for the fun activities in school, If any students at hill are that interested in sports than they should as well be focused in class and get good grades. If they actually put any effort into the sports that they are good at then they should as well be involved that much in school. Most students get a kick from saying oh today I have a basketball game so I am going to go to school. In fact they should be saying oh I want to go to school because I have a test today. I don't think that It would be fair that students think that just because they have a grade C average or lower they can get away with it I would like to state that I do agree with your argument that any student that wants to participate in any sport should have at least a grade B average Dear principle,

Students should have to gain the privilege, not just sign up for the sport
