I say important to me because If I asked the people in the office if I could use the phone to ask my mom or a parent something, and did not tell them why because it was a personal question, they would normally say "no". The reason for this is because I tend to get bored during lunch time I really don't see what is wrong with having a phone out during the time we have free. I would rather much talk to you about this in person. Please respond to this letter I have sent you. As well as if I needed to talk to my mom I could call her for something important to me, Hopefully it would change your mind about this policy. But I have reason to say that students should be able to have use in there phone during lunch periods and other free times but yet to have it off during class. 
I am fully aware you probably think it is better for the school to not have cell phones during school hours. 
Dear TEACHER_NAME, 
Kids do it either way, whether the teachers say yes or no, But kids sometimes get there phone look-in away. There for, I say we should be able to have use of a cell phone. if I have absolutely nothing to do maybe I could just listen to music on my phone or to text a friend that is away.
