You are also helping people in the process of having fun. becuase but you have alot of fun, and you will get awarded those long ride by seing something you have never seen like the excavated castle, China, and Europe. You might think that its boring and it would be really long rides, You can make a difference by joining the program and helping out countries who were in World WAR 2 and dont have food supplies, animals, and more things to help them live. You get to have fun, especially when the ship returns, after the animals have been unloaded. We played baseball, Table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and alot more games to help time pass. If you join and help it can open up the world like it did to me, "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. will have the best expirence of your life. you get to see new places, you will fell good about yourself becuase your helping other countries
