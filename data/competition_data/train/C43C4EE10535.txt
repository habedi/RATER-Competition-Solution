Another thing is sometimes people may not want their emotions read. That is one downside to it. It seems kind of crazy to think about computers reading emotions. The technology seems like it would be very expensive though. Like the article said, the computer would be able to tell if the strudent was confused. Or it could tell any other emotions the student was feeling to make sure they were getting it. This technology could be used for many things outside the classroom though. I am not sure if I would want this in the classroom or at a job yet. I may need to learn more about it first or think about it some more. It seems like a very helpful and promising idea for the future though. I am curious to see how long this technology takes to get to the classrooms and other places that may need it. I think it would be very useful in classrooms.
