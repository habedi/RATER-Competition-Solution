I suggest you form a club of volunteers at school to go on field trips to perform community service. Such as going to a homeless shelter and bringing canned food or blankets. To force someone to perform this would be unacceptable. Nobody would have fun being forced to do those things I believe it would be better to just let people volunteer for doing good deeds. Many people all over the country volunteer for community service. They are doing the right thing and get a self reward feeling after their work is complete. Dear TEACHER_NAME:

You see, This way the students can perform community service the way they want to, and you get your community service performing students. 
Influencing students to perform community service would be a much better idea than forcing them to. when a group of people volunteer to clean up trash on the beaches they are looked at as good people because they are going out of their way and schedule to do something that benefits everyone.
