I look for similarÂ responses and wise answers having similar responses can help a lot when people receive advice from others they may or may not receive the right answer they are in search for which would cause them to ask someone else and a smarter answer. 
In conclusion, when you ask someone for advice and the answer you have received wasnt really a wise answer which you most likely wouldnt accept which would cause you to ask someone else for a good answer. Next, It sometimes prove that the advice you have been given can be a fact. When you get the same answer from different people it causes you to belive it and makes you stick with that answer. 

Firstly, The reason for this is to make sure Im getting the right type of information and to be sure that it's the right thing to do. When I ask multiple people for advice
