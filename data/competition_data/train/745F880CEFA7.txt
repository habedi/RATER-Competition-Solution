I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know what's best for you. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.
