The activites can be fun because the students can participate in different clubs like art, cooking, gardening, boys and girls, and drama. Students can also have time to talk and laugh with their friends. My friend and I have been going to the boys and girls club. We have a lot of fun and weÃÂ´ve met new people. 
students should participate in after school activities. The activities can have a big impact on studentsÃÂ´ lives in the future. They will also have many opportunities. 
In conclusion , I agree because the activities can be fun for students. , I agree because the activities can help the students later on in life. Next , Some students may want to participate in different sports like football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and volleyball. And other activities like cheer, step, band, and dance. If the students participate in these activities in school, then theyÃÂ´ll have a better experience with it years later. I agree because the activties keep students busy. 
First , they can help students later on in life. and Instead of the students going home to play, they can stay after school and participate in different activites. Students will continue to learn about new things. In school, I decided to do band after school. I enjoy that activity and I learned how to play new instruments. 
they can be fun I agree because after school activities keep students busy I think students should participate in one after school activity. Do you think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Finally
