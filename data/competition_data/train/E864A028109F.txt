no coach would want a knucklehead on there team. Another reason would be that That pretty much sums everything up on why you should change the school policy so all students would have to get a B or higher. Remember that no coach would want a knucklehead on their team and it would make a student want to improve their grade in order to play a sport. the kids who have bad grades would want to get good grades. Lets say a student had many D' s in almost every class, but really wanted to play sports. This new policy would make the student get a good grade if he really wanted to play a sport. Many other people would agree too. Another reason is that the kids who really want to play sports, but have bad grades, would encourage them to get good grades. The first reason I stated is that no coach would want a kid who messes around and doesn't listen to them. `

Dear Principal,

My opinion on your policy change is positive. I really like the idea that students really have to work hard in order to play an activity. here are many reasons on why this should be approved. One reason is that Usually students that get higher grades listen more than students who get C' s, D' s, and F' s. That means the students who have good grades can learn the sport better. I think their parents would also agree.
