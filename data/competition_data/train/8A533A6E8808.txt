I think the Facial Action Coding System should be used to read how students are feeling because it would help teachers communicate with their students Like I said in the first paragraph, the computer would help students by giving them something that they would actually get. The struggle for students would be reduced with this \ technology. 
The amount of missing work would go down if the Facial Action Coding System were to be installed into students' computers. This would make the computer help with troubled students by changing the work into a something easier than the previous work. I believe that more students would show up to school if this technology were to be installed. They would see how much easier it is to learn by showing their expressions. It just might make them smile. but after a while of receiving help they would realize that it is worth it. Some students might not be comfortable with their face being scanned The computer can see if the students are into the subject or are confused. The student who is emotionally frustrated or simply confused would be helped with easier problems on their work. I myself sometimes have problems like this and I think the technology would help me and other students. 
Most students don't ask a teacher for help because they might not be feeling it and they would get behind. This is where the Facial Action Coding System would to play.
