Dear TEACHER_NAME

cause if a student did his or her best and all the could give is a c then you should let them play. A lot of students aren't able to pull of a b average so give those students a chance to play sports. 
This is how i feel about your policy, It would be un fair I think if a student has a c average you should give him or a chance there are so many students that only have sports some people that don't have sports they end up doing nothing So will you change that policy for all the students that pull of a b average cause a c average isn't that bad they are still passing but they can play sports and anything else they want. People drop out of school cause they think if they don't have the grades to play sports they cant do anything with their life. So i know you don't want that to happen
