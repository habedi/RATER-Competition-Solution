nd you could still do that in a regular car but you will at least be in control and it would be on your part. But if its not you driving the car the dealership or the manifracture will be the one to get in trouble because there system is the one driving the car. What if the car decides to turn and go fast into a ditch you can do nothing about it and you would just have to set thier and watch it happen. I know people are busy but you can atleast take time out of your day to drive somewhere yourself. ecause, the auto mechanuics will lose alot of there jobs mean yeah You can also get seriosly injured they would have to go back to college in order to know how to fix these new cars. ecause Alot of laws will have to be changed as well I think is just pure laziness because we dont want to drive. I think it will be a bad idea ecause their really wouldnt be any reason to take a drivers test because the cars already know what to do. What would the age limit be? How will the car know the aspeed limit will there have to be new road put in so the car can detect it? See i just think there would be to much conflict and we should just have to drive the cars our self. Yeah it might be easier in some ways but also harder we will have to learn alot more new things.
