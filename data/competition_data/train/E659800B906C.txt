it could also be a bad decision as well. Although this could benefit in many ways like helping make students more responsible, I would suggest telling students how they can help make a difference, showing opportunities of community service and the benefits. Many students have after-school activities that are very important to them and the forced community service could take away their free time and activities. the people who participate in community service now do it for the joy of helping others, so if students are not happy about it then what is the point? Forcing it upon them would make many students unhappy, teenagers don't like being told what to do, they like being told how to do it. I believe that students doing community service is a very helpful and responsible thing to do , but I think students should not be required to participate in it. Dear Principal
