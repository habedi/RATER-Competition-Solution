i argue you that we keep the electoral collage because of its many pros the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. With the electoral college there would be more discussion on the topic of making smart descions to electing a president Dear state senator, Taking away the electoral college would be like taking away an important part of our U.S history And that concludes why i argue you to keep the electoal college and not popular vote.      When a run off happens this creates pressure of the voters, until the help of the electoral college comes in, which in this case helps break everything up and claim a true winner. For example, in 1968 nixon and clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college, 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast The electoral college selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee (and the trust given is rarely betrayed). With that said, it will be a fair and most likely a cheat free zone. Keeping the electoal college will keep a professional way of electing a president.
