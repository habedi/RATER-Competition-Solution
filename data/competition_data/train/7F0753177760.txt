Well,since there are more pros than cons i'll go with the cons Now this got me thinking,why should we keep the Electoral College? Today in class, we were discussing if we should keep the process of the Electoral College. Firstly, and secondly Dear senator,

the Electoral College is unfair We should not keep the process of the Electoral College. The winner take all approach is just a crumb from this totally unfair and biased system. And,this system is galaxies away from being democratic in any way. So,how about we give the people what they deserve by terminating the Electoral College.    Well,where do i start! The winner take all system is definetly unfair. The Electoral College is by far a democratic way of selecting a president. Because of this system, most canididates won't spend any time at all in a state that they know they have no chance at winning in. People in South Carolina said that they never even saw a capaign ad for the canididates;or for that matter the canididates themselves. it is a non democratic way of selecting a president. 
For example,when you go to the assigned palce to vote in your area,you vote for a slate of electors. See, its the electors who vote for the president not the people. How in any way is that democratic? And, have you ever brought to thought the possibility that the winner of the electoral vote will not achieve the national popular vote. It happened in 2000 what's stopping it from happening now?
