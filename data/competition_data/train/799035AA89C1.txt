Finally, 
First, I think driverless cars shouldn't be relsed becuase The passage says, "Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motaion sensor." Having all of these sensors and be very exspenvise. And many people might not have the money to replace them if they get broken. I think driverless cars should not be able to be relesed. "The psyologist aspect of automation are really a challenge." there still to dangerous The passage states that, "Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents." This means you can't trust the car driving by itself because it's not ready to be driven by itself yet. A human still has to take alert when they're backing out. Another reason I think driverless cars are to dangerous to be relesed is because they might not have everything it takes to drive by itself. they are to exspensive 
Second, I think driverless cars shouldn't be relesed because Finally, I think driverless cars shouldn't be relesed. In the passage, it states, "There was no way, before 2000, to makesomething interresting. The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there , and the mapping wasn't there. Radar weas a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars." This is no where near time avalible for them to have every part. Having driverless cars relesed can take up to much time.
