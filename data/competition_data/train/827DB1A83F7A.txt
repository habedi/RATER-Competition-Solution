The athletic groups will be no more the foot ball team will be gone all of them will be gone except for the chess and the robotics clubs and are they fit for hitting into each other especially when the other guy is way big ger than him? But the worst thing that could happen the school is being shut down. Relationships could fall more students might drop out. A B average is asking to much from the jocks and athletes and the entire student body. hen the entire school might be the laughing stock of the district. That is not fair to the student body and you might have wimpy sport teams. I would like to tell you that nearly all the students have a C grade average and not a B grade average but I don't want to tell that to you. Dear Principle

So that's why I don't think that you should change the policies in any way possible or imaginative or hurtful.
