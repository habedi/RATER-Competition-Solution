I also believe that, Secondly I understand that you think that if you change the school policy, then most of your students, at least the ones in sports and activities, will have a higher average, but what you didn't think about was that some of your students are trying their hardest and are only achieving a grade C average. It would be unfair to pull out that student from his/her sport or activity just because he/she is having a hard time in class. These students understand what the teacher is talking about, but they are just not good at it! Dear Principal,

you might not have enough students in your teams to play against other schools. 
Having a grade C average means that you understand it, your just not good at it. Those students that would have gone to collage due to their talents with sports or whatever activity that they were in, might not be able to go because of this new policy. You might be denying hundreds of students collage education just because of a school policy!! you will be denying the collage education of some of these students that have a grade C average and are in a sport or in another activity. 
First of all, I do not like the new school policy that you are proposing. Their are many reasons why, and I am glad to state them. and if most of your students have a grade C average, then they will not be able to play the sports or participate in the activities
