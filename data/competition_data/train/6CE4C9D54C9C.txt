Just by letting us do community service you are opening the door to new things we can try. Maybe we can take community service to the next level and start doing things for this country. Community service is the first step to helping people around you. Community service is a learning experience that we should all experience for at least once Community service may take sometime of what we want to do Dear TEACHER_NAME,

community service also helps you care for your environment and find the negatives and positives of it and try to change them for the best. 
In today's world we sometimes take are community for granted and don't really see how important it should be for us. Community service also shows something you can be proud of. We can give back to our community just by doing small things we are making a big impact in our community. In a way community service is like saying thank you to our community, for allowing us to be part of it and having an education that nobody could take away from us. Community service is a way of giving back to your community. I feel like all students should participate in community service. but then you come to realize that it wasn't, probably not as important as helping your community.
