Also, not everyone in the one state that the president is trying to win over will vote for him. Electoral College votes are way more complicated then they should be. That's why I believe you should get votes based on every individual instead I For example, if you're trying to win over California but not everyone in that state wants you to rule them, then why make them angry? Everyone has their own opinion I believe. Everyone has their own voice. The people like to be heard. I think Electoral College is a bad idea because it's too much of a big process.

Dear state sentor, 

So after reading my letter i assume that it had some meaning. I hope you changed your mind about how you want to be elected. f more peoples opinions are a matter to you then you're most likely to win. I say this because people who want to rule us, such as yourself, are people who should care. People who like their opinion being heard are people who should be important to a ruler. ecause I believe that the government should use popular votes instead of the states votes Honestly, 
Should the president use popular vote to get elected or use Electoral College? That's a tough decision. I also believe that you should just get elected based on popular votes because then everyone will be more interested in voting for you Electoral college is a too confusing process and it cannot always be used.
