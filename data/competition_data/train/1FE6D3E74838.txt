in some cases it might straighten out some of the teenagers, in my reflection it might make them rethink everything they've ever done wrong. It might make them realize that all wrong doing has consequences If they want to do a good deed and decide to, than that is their opinion of choice. But requiring them to take time out of their busy schedule, and making them do something they really don't want to do is unusual punishment. But but I'm standing by it. Others might disagree with my opinion, They might have to take care of a loved one who is very ill, or perhaps attending to work just so they can keep the lights on. High priorities like those can not be put on hold. Others don't agree that they should help because they have much bigger requirements they must attend to. Choosing to help the community and help to save our environment is a very noble thing to do. In my opinion, I don't agree that students should be required to perform community service. To whomever this may concern,
