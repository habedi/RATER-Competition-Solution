Sports are one thing that students get to do in school other than learn. A C isn't a bad grade it can be brought up easily. It would be more reasonable if you wouldn't let people with D averages play. I think you should let students play sports no matter what their grade is. They might also when they play sports they make friends which might encourage them to study together or help them with stuff they don't know. Also, students wouldn't want you to take it away so they would work harder not to lose it. Dear Principal,

it wouldn't make kids happy they wouldn't get as much exercise. Also if i may suggest Most kids in the school have a C average so that would limit the number of kids who can play on a team I can only think of one reason that it would be good to do that. It is that students would want to bring there grades up They usually would just sit at home and watch T.V. all day, but when they do sports they are actually helping their minds. T.V. actually hurts the brain. Physical exercise helps the brain function and focus which later helps them study or take tests. You would actually make them smarter. 
It lets them express who they are, even if they don't have the best grades.
