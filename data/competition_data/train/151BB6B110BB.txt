There was a fellow named Luke Bomberger and, his friend asked if he wanted to go on a Europe cattle boat. He took the oppertunity and it changed the whole life for him. He even said that you would find it a hard time to not have fun. On the way there You constantly took care of the cattle and that always kept him busy Luke said. On the back he had a blast with all of his new friends they played: table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fencing,boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that helped him pass time. This program goes over seas to go and help people rebuild there country that was destroyed by the WW2 war. 
This administration is a very good program.
