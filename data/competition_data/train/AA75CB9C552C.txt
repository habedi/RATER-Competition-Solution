With their requirement to have a letter B average on their mind would consistently remind students to do their best during school. Although you may believe that this reason may be unnecessary, stop and think about students who have after school activities, let them selves let loose and whined up letting their grades go down. This way, as i have already mention, would non stop remind students to do their best during their school activities. it would also allow students not to allow their scores go down for the sliest chance. 
Another one of my reasons for encouraging your idea of the policy is that Imagine students, who have a letter C average wanting to play sports after school but aren't allowed to play because of their poor academic achievements. This way students would have to work harder for their after school freedom and privileges. Not only would this new policy of yours would encourage students to work harder, but would also help them achieve greater accomplishments for their grades. I believe that this new policy of yours may actually help students confidence build up. 
For one Whether many students may be a grade C average, I still believe that students should have at least a grade B average in order to play sports for numerous reasons. Ever since you've placed a new policy about student's after school programs I've been thinking about its outcome on other students. This new policy may and may not work on the students because your new requirement enables students to have at least a grade B average. Which many students are not. Dear Principle:
