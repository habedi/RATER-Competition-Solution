New laws will be coming some will be changing in case of an accident. In "Driverless Cars Are Coming" it talks about the pros and cons of a driverless car.

Cons of the driverless cars are common sense I just feel like it is a dangerest issue that the world does not need to worry about.     
In conclusion this is my opinion and my position on "Diverless Cars Are Coming". What if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is a fault the driver or the manufacturer is the question. Another thing is what if the car just glitchs and there is not enough time for myself to stop. The driver would still need to be on alert the whole time while driving you will nees a whole lot of sensors which cost a whole lot of money. Myslef i'm against the whole driverless car To be for or against the delelopment of driverless cars. There are multiple reasons to be for them but also multiple reasons to be against
