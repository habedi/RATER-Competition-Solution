but we do need the college because we also vote there and if  we dont then we do other important stuff there. 
so instead of making a extreme dicision like this then you should think about the people and not let a hasty decision have a disaster on this good state because we could have horable president or govenor so please think about what you do or it will end nicly or horrably desatrouse.

cause there are many people who depend on that college as a electoral support. 
so inconclusion changing the college to a popular vote could be a bad thing to do dear state senitor I humbaly suggest that you don't turn from electoral college You may think that we dont need the electoral college
