I'm against this car idea. Yes it would be better on gas because it would be electric, So many people get hurt or even killed because of technology and trying to put technology in a car would just make it worse. Yes the car can be quick, but what if the car just swerves off the rode so many people would get hurt from a car thats doesnt have a human drining the car. If the world had a car that didn't need a human driver a lot of taxi drivers would loss out of a job. The only reason they got the job because they can't do school very well, so their last resort was to become a taxi driver. With these cars people would losse thier jobs. thats all the reasons that I think about the cars I don't think we should have them it just to risky. the article says "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?" Someting like this could start a lot of fights with car companys and inserince. The car always needs a real human to drive the car. People hate when there kids text and drive. but thats the only positive thing I see out of this. Why would a parent what there kid having a car that drives it self and just full of technology? That just make the parents more nevers for there kid to go out on any day. Plus people tht arent good with technology in the frist place and they get a car like that that would be crazy. To have some one who can't use a high tech phone like the Iphone would be unsafe to the world. I would be easy to blame the car because of "tech problems" so the car company looks bad to other people. So the car company losses custemers. Like
