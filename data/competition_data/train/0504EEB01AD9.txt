It would be difficult for a student to have to focus on two things, grades and sports. If that student so chooses to be an athlete, than they'll want to focus on their sport. Trust me, you will get many complaints from students and parents daily. A grade C has always been the average for participating in sports/activities and I think that is very reasonable. Most people anyways do better than that anyhow, but pressuring students to keep their grade above a B may be asking a lot. Again that means they have to focus on academics and activities. Changing the grade may be one positive thing for our school, but many negative things follow. I have recently heard that you are considering changing the C average for participating in sports or other activities to a B average Although I do fully understand why you would choose to do this I believe that it should be kept at a C average. Many students in this school participate in additional activities and it is hard to keep your grades at tip top level. It's sort of like multi-tasking, it doesn't really work. Some students may want to take up a career in a certain sport or major in a certain activity. It's not always easy to be the best at both. Many students at this school play soccer on the school soccer team and are considering doing it professionally. That may sound ridiculous to a person who works business because a sport doesn't sound like a suitable job for a life. An athlete would disagree. That is the job that person would enjoy doing for awhile. Work is supposed to be a job you do to earn money, but it should also be enjoyable, after all you do have to work everyday. Dear ,
