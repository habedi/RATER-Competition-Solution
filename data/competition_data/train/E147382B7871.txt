  bring cleanliness to the air to whole new level and There would be less D.U.I'S,  distracted driving,  even collisions because some young individual decided to break the law.  So many positive things to think of and yet the court would still have to deal with these occaisional issues.

At least they would be occaisional.   As well as less deaths due to a motor vehicle. No more angry citizens beacuse of global warming and our atmosphere will stop getting thinner Going 'car-free' seems like an excellent idea! Our streets will be so safe that parents will not have to worry as much about their kids getting abducted or hit by a car.  For example if we were to only use public transportation such as buses there is no way that a child or adult can be taken and successfully brought to the destination of the persons choice.  Simply because there will be no where to hide or secretly place the child or adult. Perhaps even less days of usage It would be safer 
The amount of deaths would drop dramatically if cars were used less on a daily basis.
