So if they were aloud then nobody would try to sneak it all the time during classes We wouldn't have to break the rules if there was no rules to break. We are equal in rights. If the students will only be aloud to use them during free periods then so should the teachers. So the better option is definitely to let the students use them during there free classes. We would be really grateful of you if you could be so nice as to let us keep them. plus if they were banned how would you check every student to make sure that they didn't have a phone with them? And since we are all equal then you would have to leave yours at home too and all the teachers would not be aloud either. phones are useful to the student body and if they were taken away then it would be very inconvenient The students are American citizens too. The teachers are aloud to use theirs and so should the students you should let the students use them during free time and lunch Dear principal,

If you made it so that cell phone were banned from the school then a lot of people would need to use the school phones so that they could get rides home and things like that
