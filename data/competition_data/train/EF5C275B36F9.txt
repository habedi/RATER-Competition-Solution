mistakes are being made with this way of election his winner takes all system that we have in each state is horrible completely unfair to the voters why should we even try if we know we cant win? sure yea that's how we have done it for a long time and i know some people are scared of change but change isn't always necessarily a bad thing. Just to wrap things up here you have it this is my opinion on electoral college i think it should change electoral college is too confusing it needs to change.

half the time voters cant even control who their electors vote for and sometimes voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate... if your elector might not even elect your candidate and half the time when you do get to tell them they don't listen and take advantage of their power. You have to vote on a elector that might not even vote for the candidate you want...its almost like you're not even voting whats the point in voting then we have this winner takes all crap witch is completely unfair too voters. why don't we just do it, with the way we do it now with electoral college mistakes are being made. according to the passage I read "Does the Electoral Work? in source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by:Brad Plumer" you have to vote on a elector that might not even vote for the candidate you want over 60% of voters would prefer a direct vote anyway so... their are so many things wrong with electoral college that their is really no point in keeping it. the electoral college is also unfair due too the winner takes all system in each state. Electoral College , whats so great about it? Why should we keep it, whats the point?
