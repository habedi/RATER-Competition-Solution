There are many reasons and evidence to support my statement. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from texting and driving. Across the country there are laws that are being made about the dangers of the use of the cell phone. I believe that cell phones should not be able to be used while in control of a car. The Dangers of Driving While Using the Cellphone

Texting and driving delays your reaction time as much as driving under the influence of alcohol. There are many other opportunities for you to be able to get in touch with someone if it is urgent. There is new technology that has been created such as handsfree technology. There is Bluetooth, that will connect your phone to your call to make hands free texts and calls, if needed. If you get into a car wreck because of texting and driving, your insurance rate will increase. The reasoning is that when you are in use of the cell phone while driving it significantly increases your chance of getting into an accident. Car accidents are the leading death of teenagers these days because they are too distracted looking at their phone, rather than paying attention to the road. 
The increase depends on many factors. Insurers follow the Insurance Services Offices standard of increasing a premium by twenty to forty percent of the insurer's base rate after an accident. If you avoid texting and driving you will not have to worry about your insurance going up, but you also you will not have to worry about your life or anyone in the passenger seat of your car. In conclusion, I believe that you should not be able to use the cellphone while driving. There are many laws and reasons on why it should start being illegal everywhere. People just need to start thinking about their lives and the other people around them, when they start to make decisions. They should realize that there are consequence that come with our decisions.
