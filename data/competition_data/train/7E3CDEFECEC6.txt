If you were to make community service mandatory at school, how do you think that will unravel? For all you know, petitions could be made by my fellow classmates. I'm sure some of my peers agree with my point of view regarding this topic. I believe that community service can be an extracurricular activity outside of school, if anything. 
Yes, community service is beneficial to the community, but students need to focus on one thing, and one thing only. School. I personally do not think that community service should be required by all students. Dear TEACHER_NAME,

You see, I know how it's like to be a student, as do you, and I think we can both agree on how hectic situations can get throughout the year. Homework becomes burdensome at times, schoolwork becomes tedious. Your life is bifurcated between school and outside of school, leaving almost no room for anything else.
