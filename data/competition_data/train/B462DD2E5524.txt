My suggestion for you is that you keep the policy we already have because we try our best to show you in class that we are good students, who work hard for what they do You may not think that we try our hardest in our classes and at school but i know for a fact that all students at least try. If many students in our school already have a C average, you already know that there will not be many students participating this year so, why even think about changing the policy? I am writing this letter to you for all of my classmates. You know that the students in our school are working to keep their grades up, therefore not disappointing any teachers, especially parents. because keeping a C average is hard enough Dear TEACHER_NAME,

The policy for participating in school sports or activities should not be changed
