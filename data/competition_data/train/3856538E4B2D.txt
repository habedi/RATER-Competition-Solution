It states in the article that over 60 pecent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. I would like to keep the Electoral College because i think it works out better than the popular vote. nd plus it only requires 270 electoral votes to elect the president and theres 538 electors Also it says under nthe electoral college system, votes dont vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. I think we should just keep the Electoral College for a couple years and then switch and see which ones better and keep that one.

Dear

Senator ,

If we had the popular vote then there would be an unfair voting cast and we would be introuble. Theres also rumors of the Electoral College like people calling it the disaster factor because people say it cause to much drama and is risky. they would abuse the voting if it was by popular vote In some states they have only a limited number of electors depending on how big or small the state is. Also the winner takes all system should go with both presidents because they both worked hard to get there and shouldnt just be left out they should seperate the electors evenly some people cant become the president or vice president so they shouldnt leave out the vice president. It should just be up to the citizens to chose who runs for president so that way there isnt such big arguments over who became president. I understand if there was a tie in the Electoral vote then it would be all up to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president. I think
