My second statemeant is Well my first reason is Luke bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. second is But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger it opened up the world to him. One more reason is that he said"I'm grateful for the opportunity"he says. Both of thoses reasons suport why he thought it was a great opportunity. a great opportunity of a lifetime to join the program. both of these statemeant are going to help answer the question to the text.

Next,I'm going to give you details on why it was "luke also found time to have fun on board. One peice of evidence is "Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time". My second peice of evidence is "Luke also toured an excavated castle in crete and marveled at the panama canal on his way to china. 
One is "he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime". I am going to tell you the reasons Luke joined the program both of thoses statemeants help me answer question. Which is why he joined the program. Both of my reasons were it was great opportunity of a lifetime and Luke was also able to have freetime found time to have fun on board. In conclusion y second reason is he also found time to have fun on board especally on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.
