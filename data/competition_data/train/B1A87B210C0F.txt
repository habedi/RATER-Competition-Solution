If you are going to be in Congress and are voting for a specific party, then you need to stay in that party. The canadite is going to feel like you betrayed them after everything they have done for you. Just because your rich doesn't make it okay to betray what's right for this country. "But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)" (In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our  despised method of choosing the President, Richard A. Posner). Through our troubled times, Congress has never stopped trying to make everything better. That is what this nation needs and hopes for. The people have the majority vote, so they should be able to have a say. It does take longer but it is what's right. The votes should be runned by the people and they should have a say if the person running to be President or Vice President should run at all. They should be wise with age and should know better than to elect someone who is no good for this country. We should have a Congress that knows best about what we should do to make our country better. We should keep the Electoral College but should change some of the rules. Dear Senator,

Do not get rid of the Electoral College because it helps us who to choose to run our nation. Just make some adjustments and this country will be the best it can be. 
We don't need to get rid of the Congress but we need to be better about who we put in the office to run our beautiful country. They need to come and show us who they really are. Visit a town and get them your vote. The Electoral College has done some good things in the past but we should change it. The Congress needs to be made up of people who know what is right and which canadite to choose as our President.
