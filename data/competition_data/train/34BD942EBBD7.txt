I would extremely like it if we got to have our cell phones out in free time.

All these reasons show why i support this policy.

I would very much appreciate it if we got to have our phones out in free time. 

I think the student who goofs off or gets in trouble should just have his phone taken away. 

There are multiple reasons why i agree with policy one. During lunch i think everyone would have a much better time with there phones out because it gives them a chance to be more social. 
Although there are negative and positives, i still would have to go with policy one. 
One negative is that there is a higher chance that you could get your phone stolen.

Also, your teachers could see you sending bad stuff to other people in your class at that time.

Some students wouldn't turn there cell phones off in class, so therefore more cell phones would be taken away. 
There are some negatives for having phones out to though. The first reason is because i am a teenager and teenagers always want to have there phones with them.

Another reason is if i didn't feel good, i would like my parents to know.

Lastly, if we get to have phones at lunch and other free times, then there wont be as many phones out and on during class. 
Some students are known for goofing off and not listening. 
They could get more social because they would talk to there friends at there lunch table and text someone in there lunch that doesn't sit with them. 
The whole school shouldn't suffer from not having there phones because one person messed up. Dear TEACHER_NAME,

From my point of view, i believe policy one is better. If a student does goof off or gets in trouble, i think just that student should get his phone privileges taken away. 
Also, students would be able to have there phones out in slt, so they could text any of there friends during that time.
