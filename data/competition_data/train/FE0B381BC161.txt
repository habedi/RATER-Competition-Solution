and then helping the community will become more like a hassle than something we sacrificed our time for. Actually this Thursday the school is helping out by having a bake sale for a girl who died of cancer and they're raising money for awareness .

Some kids are spending time tonight to bake cupcakes, cookies and other sweets for the bake sale.

While others are staying after school to help sell when they could have been at home on the computer or working on homework. You might not notice it but we students do a lot of community service. 
Like a girl I know who babysits her neighbors kids every once and a while or even a kid picking up a piece of trash in the school cafeteria. 
See we help out on our own when we have time, but if you make all of us participate then we won't be happy Personally I can understand why you want everyone to help but you don't need to force us to do this. Everyone helps out every day even if they don't know it. 
Like the students that are having trouble at school and they need to focus on their grades so they can get a good education. But what about the students that don't have time to help out. 
I can see your point of view and how we should all help out and do our share to help the environment. I want you to think about community service and why you want all of the students to participate. 
Dear Mr. Principal,

Or the kids who's parents are in the hospital and the kids is taking care of the parent and they don't have the time to even worry about themselves. I hope you truly understand our point of view and I hope you will give us an option on whether we should help the community, because we all help out in our own little ways.
