Also, A healthy planet would be better for us all, rather than a smog filled polluted planet. Not driving is way better for the environment. If people didn't drive cars there would be less air pollution to worry about. It would be so much better if no one drove a car. No one likes waiting around in traffic. It would be much faster to just bike or walk. Biking and walking also help you exercise and stay fit. It would keep everyone in good shape. There would be so much less noise pollution.  In Vauban, Germany, a city without cars, all you can hear is the swish of bicycles and the chattering of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Cars all together cause so much noise, and noise causes people to be so tense. The world should be filled with sounds that are gentle to our senses. the streets would be less crowded and people would be able to get around faster. It would be so great if for even one day out of the year no one drove. We should just give it a chance and see the positive effects it has. Lets all give not driving a shot!
