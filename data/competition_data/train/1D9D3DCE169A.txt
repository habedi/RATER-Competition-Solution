It has come to my attention that you are considering making mandatory community service hours. I can see that the decision you are faced with is a difficult one. I do not believe that community service should be mandatory. 
I know, Mr. Principal, that you are probably judging me as a lazy teenager who doesn't care about his community, but I am prepared with several points to back up my opinion. 
First of all I would like to say that I believe that community service is very important. If you change you Modus Operandae from forcing students to do community service to encouraging them to do it than they it will increase the possibility for them to carry there good habits far beyond the limit that the school would set. But also believe that it should be done for the right reason. Another reason why community service should be encouraged rather than enforced is that man students involved with sports and other extra-curricular activities simply don't have time in the day for it during the week. Many students are preparing college and writing essays and other preparation classes after school. Won't they be more productive members of society with a good education? I think that everyone can help out here and there. Dear Mr. Principal,
