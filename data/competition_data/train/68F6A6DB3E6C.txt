The computer could notice that your confused and try to show you a different lesson or even just try to show it a different way. This would help the teachers because they would have more help if everyone is stuck on the same lesson and needed help. I think it would be most useful in a classroom because if a teacher is busy with another student. Most people would like it because you can use it in video games and movies. They could use it to make the characteristics look more real and it would be easier to make them show their emotions by using the FACS. Because it can read all the muscles in the face so they could use it to make the facial expresions look more real.     It could help in a clsaaroom and many more places I think that the facial action codeing system is valuable, because it could help people everywhere. it could tell you if someone you know is happy or sad.
