students parents will not be happy that there child can not play sports over a b average Why do we have to make a b average in all are classes just to play a sport when a c average is still passing. But other schools don't have to make a b average to play a sport so why do we that's are not fair So please don't change the policy to a b average its for the schools good interest so please don't do that or there is going to be firing to do with some good teachers. they wont even be able to watch the game and see there team mates play the game that they should of been in but they failed with a c average. and cause So if that happens it is going to make the school look bad and make you look bad so just keep the average at a c average or people will start complaining.

Then Now there will be less players on are football team and we will not win are games. And the same thing will happen to basket ball if you do that they will not win a game and make the school look bad. 
Then people will start going to other schools to play sports students that have a c in any class will be kick off the team and will not be able to participate in any of the games You mine as well just shut down all sports. And no more students will come to the school And and then teachers will have to be fired there will be not so many students cause they will not like the new policy
