### Downloading the Models from Kaggle

We need to download the segmentation models from Kaggle. To do so, we can run the commands shown below in the root directory
of this repository.

```bash
bash bin/download_models.sh && bash bin/make_model_pack.sh
```

The size of the models is about 80 GB, so the download may take a while.
